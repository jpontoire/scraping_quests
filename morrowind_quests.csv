"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Addhiranirr_Informant","Return to Caius in Balmora for your orders. Meet with the informants in Vivec. Huleeya Informant Meet with Huleeya at the Black Shalk Cornerclub in the Foreign Quarter. Calm the locals and escort Huleeya to Jobasha's Bookshop to receive his notes. Addhiranirr Informant Meet with Addhiranirr in the Underworks of the St. Olms Canton. Find and tell the excise agent Duvianus Platorius that Addhiranirr has left for the mainland. Receive the information from Addhiranirr. Meet Mehra Milo Meet with Mehra Milo at the Library of Vivec in the Temple Canton. Steal or buy the book Progress of Truth. Return to Caius in Balmora.","Huleeya Addhiranirr Mehra Milo Orders from Caius[edit] After the last errand, Caius tells you to train for a while and come back to him later. Specifically, your character needs to be at least level 3 before Caius will give you the next assignment. At that point, he sends you on a fact-finding mission to the city of Vivec. Your mission is to track down and rendezvous with three people: Addhiranirr, a Khajiit Thieves Guild member in St. Olms, Huleeya, an Argonian Morag Tong assassin at the Black Shalk Cornerclub in the Foreign Quarter, and Mehra Milo, a Tribunal Temple priestess in the Hall of Wisdom of the Temple Canton. Caius is once again looking for any Sixth House or Nerevarine Cult information and he gives you 200 gold for expenses. The quickest way is to take the Silt Strider or the Mages Guild Guide, but feel free to take the scenic route. Huleeya Informant[edit] Huleeya is in the Black Shalk Cornerclub, in the Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks. He should be easy to find, as he is the only Argonian in the room. Unfortunately, Huleeya seems to be having trouble with the locals, who will not let him pass. Talk with the Dark Elf, Ethys Savil, or one of his two friends, and persuade him to leave the Argonian alone. Raising his disposition a bit will work, but so will homicide. If you try to leave with Huleeya without talking to one of the thugs, they will attack and you will have to protect Huleeya. Attacking the thugs first will result in Huleeya refusing to talk to you. Once you've solved this, you may escort Huleeya unhindered to Jobasha's Rare Books. Jobasha's bookshop is on the same level as the cornerclub, in the Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks, just on the opposite side. Once you're inside the bookshop with Huleeya, you will receive one Reputation point for your help and he will give you some notes to take to Caius. Also while at the bookshop, pick up the book Progress of Truth on the second floor far left bookcase as you will be needing it later in this quest. You can steal it when the Ordinator patrols elsewhere, or just buy it. Addhiranirr Informant[edit] Addhiranirr is the next closest contact in the St. Olms Canton, southeast of the Foreign Quarter (past the Redoran and next to the St. Delyn cantons). It turns out Addhiranirr is difficult to find as almost no one in St. Olms knows where she is. With enough exploration and questions, you do eventually find her all alone in the northeast Underworks, hiding from a Census and Excise agent. In order to get anything out of her, the agent must be taken care of. The agent in question is Duvianus Platorius, who can be found in St. Olms Waistworks. As usual, you can either kill him or persuade him that Addhiranirr has fled. Note that if you happen to accidentally tell him where Addhiranirr is, you can still get the information Caius wants by raising Addhiranirr's disposition until she will talk to you. Also, if you tell Duvianus Platorius where Addhiranirr is and come back later to talk about the topic 'Addhiranirr', he will give you the response normally given if you had chosen to lie to him. Anyway, once the agent is out of the way, Addhiranirr will let you know that the Sixth House is into smuggling, but no one knows what due to intense secrecy. Meet Mehra Milo[edit] The last of the contacts is Mehra Milo. She may be found in the Library of Vivec, located in the Hall of Wisdom in the Temple Canton at the southern end of Vivec. Once you find her and follow her to the back of the library, she will tell you what she knows about the Nerevarine cult. She'll also suggest that you obtain a copy of the book Progress of Truth for Caius. Although the library has a copy of the book, it is under guard, so she suggests trying the local bookshops, even though the book is officially banned by the Tribunal Temple. The copy in the library is the tall book on top of the bookshelf in the southwest corner. Alternatively, you can just buy a copy from Jobasha's Rare Books in the Lower Waistworks of the Foreign Quarter for 150 gold. Other copies can be found at: Tel Uvirith, Arelas' House Vivec, Hall of Justice Secret Library Vivec, Telvanni Tower Return to Caius[edit] Return the information to Caius, who will promote you to Journeyman and suggest you take more time to train and do some other guild work to keep your cover up. Come back for the next part of the quest in a few days."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:An_Admiring_Sponsor","Talk with people in the House to be directed to Crassius Curio for sponsoring. Speak to Crassius Curio to learn his request. Unequip all your items. Speak to Crassius Curio again to be sponsored.","You Need a Sponsor[edit] Once you reach the rank of Lawman in the House, you'll need a sponsor in order to be promoted further. Talking with people in the House, you will be directed to Crassius Curio in his manor on the Hlaalu Plaza in Vivec. Crassius Curio[edit] If you haven't met Curio before, he's a strange one to say the least. In order to be sponsored, all you need to do is take your clothes off... all of them. Once you've removed everything, just speak with him to be sponsored. However, this entire quest can be skipped if you have already been named Hortator of House Hlaalu, just talk to Duke Vedam Dren in Ebonheart about the ""Camonna Tong"". He will then ""name you Grandmaster of House Hlaalu"", in reality this simply raises your rank in House Hlaalu twice, which should make you House Cousin of House Hlaalu. After that Curio will send you to Odral Helvi and the questline continues normally. Spying on Odral Helvi[edit] Curio will then direct you to Odral Helvi for more quests. It seems like he suspects Helvi of corruption and he wants you to keep him informed of Helvi's moves."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Aeta_Wave-Breaker%27s_Jewels","Find Aeta Wave-Breaker in the West Gash region, east of Caldera, and tell her that you will help recover her stolen jewels. Find the thieves' hideout: the cave Shushishi, northeast of Aeta. Make your way through the cave until you find the Khajiit Dro'Zhirr. Either kill Dro-zhirr, or ""convince"" him to give you the jewels. Bring the jewels back to Aeta to receive the 300 gold.","Finding Aeta[edit] Aeta can be found in the West Gash region, directly east of Caldera, looking wistfully across the hills to the east. If you don't see her there, find the armorer's shop, and look for the stone wall opposite his entrance. Go around the northern end of the wall and head southeast for a few steps; she should be easy to spot. Speak to her about ""some notorious thieves"" and agree to retrieve her jewels. Finding Shushishi[edit] The cave of Shushishi, where Dro'Zhirr and his fellow bandits are hiding, is northeast of Aeta, roughly east of the Caldera Governor's Hall. If you are able to use a levitate spell (or have a similar way of getting across high obstacles), get to the top of the hills northeast of Aeta. (Otherwise, you'll have to head south and take the long walk around the hills.) You should see a ravine that runs north-to-south on the other side; the entrance to Shushishi is right at the southern end of the ravine. If you have reasonable climbing skills, you can also climb the cleft in the hills just southeast of the Indalen Ancestral tomb, northeast of Caldera. You will end up just above the Abaelun Mine. It is then just a short walk east and south to Shushishi. Inside the Cave[edit] When you enter Shushishi, prepare to be attacked by an Orc carrying a random magic axe. As you progress through the cave, you'll encounter several other bandits as well as four slaves. Dro'Zhirr himself won't attack, so you can either persuade him to give you the jewels or take them by force. Collecting the Reward[edit] When you've obtained the two pieces of simple jewelry (an expensive amulet and ring), make your way back to Aeta. Speak to her, and she'll give you 300 gold for her family heirlooms."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ahemmusa_Nerevarine","Talk with the Wise Woman Sinnammu Mirpal in the Ahemmusa Camp. Secure the Ald Daedroth shrine (north of the camp) for Sinnammu (easiest method is to kill everyone). Return to Sinnammu and escort her to the Inner Shrine to be named Nerevarine.","Ahemmusa Camp[edit] If you haven't found out the location of the Ahemmusa Camp yet, ask the Ashlanders in the other camps. The Ahemmusa Tribe can be found on the far northeast corner of the main island (check your in-game map once you talk to her about it). It's a long walk, but you can grab a boat to Tel Mora and then to Vos, and then travel a short distance north to the camp. Sinnammu Mirpal needs your help Sinnammu Mirpal[edit] Once you reach the Ahemmusa Camp, talk to any of the Ashlanders, who will tell you that you should show courtesy to the Gulakhans before speaking to the wise woman. The Ahemmusa Gulakhans are Kausi, Dutadalk, and Yenammu. Kausi can be found in his Yurt, and Dutadalk and Yenammu in Dutadalk's Yurt. Speak with any of the three about the Nerevarine and they will permit you to speak to the wise woman, Sinnammu Mirpal. Mention that you wish her to name you the Nerevarine. She will agree, but on one condition: that you secure a safe place for the Ahemmusa in Ald Daedroth, an ancient Daedric Shrine north of the camp (check your in-game map). In the past, the shrine was a traditional refuge for the tribe in times of trouble, but now it has been overtaken by cultists. Once you make Ald Daedroth safe, you will have to escort her there to prove it. Ald Daedroth[edit] Ald Daedroth is directly north of the camp, though it's quite a swim (or walk if you have a Water Walking spell handy). When you arrive, it will become apparent that things are a bit more complicated than Mirpal made out. The shrine is currently being assaulted by Ordinators. Initially, the Ordinators outside will not be hostile towards you. If you speak to one of them, they will ask you who you are. If you tell them that you are a cultist, or that you are the Nerevarine, they will attack you. If you tell them you are merely there to loot the shrine, they will ignore you. Many of the cultists are quite dangerous and wield enchanted weapons, so it may be best to let them fight the Ordinators rather than getting their attention. If you do not intervene, the Ordinators will still win most of the fights. To make the shrine safe, you need to reach the Antechamber, which is accessible via the Inner Shrine. When you enter the shrine, go down the stairs and to the door straight across the large hall. You do not need to clear out the Left Wing or the Right Wing areas. In the Antechamber, you will encounter the priestess Hlireni Indavel, who is initially not hostile towards you. If you raise her disposition to 90 or above, or if your Speechcraft is 50 or above, you can persuade her to take pity on the Ahemmusa. If your level or reputation is 20 or higher, you can threaten to kill her and she will submit. Otherwise, you will need to kill her. However, making an arrangement with Hlireni or killing the cultists does not have any effect, and Sinnammu will be satisfied that the shrine is safe even if you do not speak with her at all. It is not necessary to kill any of the Ordinators in order to make the shrine safe. Escorting Sinnammu[edit] However you decide to go about it, once you've made the shrine safe, return to Mirpal and escort her to the shrine. She has a water walking ability, so despite her warnings, she is actually safe from attack by Slaughterfish if you use that method to get there. Bring her to the Inner Shrine's statue and she will recognize you as the Nerevarine and give you the Madstone of the Ahemmusa to identify yourself as such. You'll receive one point of Reputation when you bring her to the shrine, and another when she acknowledges you as Nerevarine."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ahnassi,_a_Special_Friend","Meet Ahnassi in the Halfway Tavern in Pelagiad and let her admire your smooth moves. Give Ahnassi the gift of friendship by acting on her tip about a special belt. Share a care with Ahnassi to learn that a Camonna Tong thug, Daren Adryn, has frightened her. Travel to Gnaar Mok and take care of him, which ever way you choose. Return to have Ahnassi clear your criminal record. Hear about a key to the Redoran Treasury in Vivec and plunder the vaults. Ahnassi's old friend has turned to Skooma; convince him to let go of that habit. (Optional) Visit Ahnassi's friend, the Acrobatics Master trainer Senyndie, for better prices and a skill book. Bring Ahnassi two flowers, a Coda Flower and a Gold Kanet, as a token of your love. Steal a Flamemirror Robe from a Telvanni wizard in return for 20 ebony throwing stars. Pick up the Elvul's Black Blindfold (a glove actually) from the Imperial Commission inside Castle Ebonheart.","Ahnassi, a Special Friend[edit] If you are a male character, visit the Khajiit Ahnassi in the Halfway Tavern in Pelagiad. Raise her disposition to 50 and she'll open up to you. Choose topic Thieves Guild to receive Honor Among Thieves (it will only be obtainable from her if the quest isn't started yet, a player isn't a member of Thieves Guild, a player has >= 50 Agility and her disposition >= 50). After that, choose the smooth moves and her profession dialogue topics and then Give Ahnassi the gift of friendship. She'll then plead with you to come and visit her often, which opens up a string of quests with her. A New Belt[edit] Once you and Ahnassi are properly acquainted, she'll reveal to you that the guest Hrordis, upstairs, has a magic belt and worships Mehrunes Dagon. The belt is actually the Belt of Sanguine Fleetness which is needed for the involved Threads of the Webspinner quest of the Morag Tong, so hang on to it if you decide to whack Hrordis. However, Hrordis won't talk to you, so either have a crime rating already, or go without clothes so you will be able to taunt her, or use Frenzy Humanoid (and let her or her summon strike first), among other tactics; see her article for numerous strategies to avoid a tavern-wide brawl and a murder bounty. If you speak to Ahnassi about the new friend topic, you'll open up the share a gift option which will allow her to give you a quality potion of feather. Pressure from the Camonna Tong[edit] Share a care with Ahnassi to learn that a Camonna Tong thug, Daren Adryn, has frightened her by trying to force her to join the guild (which doesn't sound right, since the Camonna Tong doesn't like outlanders or non-Dunmer at all!). Someone bothering your girlfriend just won't do, so go and pay Daren a surprise visit in Nadene Rotheran's shack in the town of Gnaar Mok. You can talk to him about Ahnassi, but it will only serve to delay the inevitable fight with him and, unfortunately, the other three Camonna Tong members in the shack. The other three NPCs in the shack can be spared by exiting the building immediately after killing Daren Adryn, casting a Chameleon spell on yourself, then entering the shack again and casting a Calm Humanoid spell on the three NPCs before looting Daren's corpse. Return to Ahnassi, who will be so pleased that she will clear your entire current criminal record. She will also give you some new gifts including an extravagant shirt and pants and the Short Blade skill book The 36 Lessons of Vivec, Sermon 30. The Redoran Vaults[edit] Once you've taken care of Daren, Ahnassi will tell you that the Redoran noble Beldrose Dralor has a key to two small chests in the Redoran Treasury in Vivec, in his wife's chest of clothes. The Dralor Manor is located in the Redoran Plaza in Vivec and the key can be found in an unlocked chest of drawers in the top bedroom. It's better than she says, and leads to one of the greatest loot hauls in the entire game: the key actually unlocks the entire Lower Vault of the Redoran Treasury (and two chests within it, which are only a small bit of the booty to be found here). Just watch out for the guards who will attack if they see you take anything (the key words here being ""see you""). See Redoran Vaults § Robbing the Redoran Treasury for details. The Third Wheel[edit] If you explore her share a care dialogue topic, it turns out that your girlfriend has a former mate, J'Dhannar, about whom she still cares, and who is in some trouble. J'Dhannar is a Skooma addict who lives in the St. Olms canton in Vivec, and Ahnassi wants you to try to persuade him to quit the drug, though common wisdom about Skooma is ""once an addict, always an addict"". You'll find him on the lower level of the Canalworks section of St. Olms. He will become quite irate when you try and get him off the Skooma.  He'll also insist that he and Ahnassi are not former mates, but current ones. If you speak with a Savant (such as Ladia Flarugrius upstairs in the Halfway Tavern in Pelagiad where Ahnassi is, or Crazy-Legs Arantamo in Vivec's Foreign Quarter) about Skooma addiction, the book Confessions of a Skooma-Eater will be recommended.  Valued at 25 gold, it can be had at Jobasha's Rare Books (as one would probably expect) in Vivec's Foreign Quarter, and at the shop of Codus Callonus in Ald'ruhn, among other places. Return to J'Dhannar with the book and, with a disposition of 50+, he will agree to read the book and give up Skooma. He will also release Ahnassi from their marital bond. Return to Ahnassi with the news. Note: If you have the book in your inventory already, you can get him to quit Skooma the first time you talk to him.  While this will skip his dialogue about still being Ahnassi's mate, it will not disrupt his releasing her from that arrangement. Become a Very Special Friend[edit] Once this is done, return to Ahnassi and you'll hear that J'Dhannar has indeed quit the skooma and has returned home to Elsweyr. Ahnassi now considers you her very special friend and invites you to visit her home in town, supplying you with a key. You can basically consider yourself as close to married as you'll get within the game, and you can use her house as your own. Ahnassi will now be found in her/your house from this point on. She Knows This Acrobat ...[edit] Once you and Ahnassi move in together, you have the chance to meet with Ahnassi's friend, Senyndie, at the Arena Fighters Quarters in Vivec. She just happens to be the Master Trainer of Acrobatics (meaning that you can train with her all the way up to skill level 100). Mention Ahnassi to Senyndie and the latter's Disposition will soar, meaning lower training prices, as well as a free copy of The Black Arrow, Part I, an Acrobatics skill book. Flowers for the Lady[edit] Speak with Ahnassi again using the share a gift topic to learn that she wants two flowers, a Coda Flower and a Gold Kanet. Sounds simple enough, and the gold kanet is indeed hard to miss in most places (look at the crossroads west of Pelagiad for instance). The coda is more difficult to find, and is actually the flower of the Draggle-Tail plants found along the Bitter Coast region. The best place to find them is between the town of Seyda Neen and the stronghold of Hlormaren far to the northwest. You can also buy a coda from Peragon at Moonmoth Legion Fort. Return the flowers to Ahnassi for her profuse thanks. The Wizard's Robe[edit] Once you give her the flowers, Ahnassi will ask you to steal a Flamemirror Robe from the wizard Mavon Drenim's lair in Vivec, Telvanni Plaza. Drenim is a powerful opponent and will most likely know when you've entered before you do. Either face the wizard and kill him if you can, or take the stealthy / runaway approach and take the robe from the closet (you can actually manage to squeeze yourself behind the closet, thus blocking you from view and allowing you to freely take the robe without being spotted). Keep it for yourself by thanking her for the tip or gift it to Ahnassi for 20 ebony throwing stars in return. Keep in mind that you may get a writ for Drenim as a Morag Tong quest, so you may be able to complete both at once (or do the Morag Tong one first and simply hold on to the robe). However, if you do this part of Ahnassi's quest prior to being given the writ from the Morag Tong, you will not receive any reward from the Tong because you killed him without a writ. (You can actually give Ahnassi any Flamemirror Robe, such as the one you might legally receive for completing the quest, ""For the Love of a Bosmer"".) Blinded by Love[edit] In the last quest from Ahnassi, revealed again by her share a gift topic, you have to retrieve Elvul's Black Blindfold (a glove actually) from the Imperial Commission inside Ebonheart's Grand Council Chambers. Ahnassi will tell you that it is well guarded, and inform you of a secret entrance located underwater just outside of Ebonheart. If you take her advice, you may be attacked in the secret entrance by Furius Acilius wearing Lord's Mail, one of the best cuirasses in the game (but only if you talk to him).  He's tougher than the average fight, but the cuirass is well worth it. (If you are in the Imperial Legion, you may wish to postpone this fight for the armor artifact, because it is part of a major Legion quest.) After progressing through the passages, you will have to get by two locked doors (level 95), which can be tricky if your Security skill is low or your Open spellcasting not high enough, although the Worn Imperial Key found in one of the crates in the passage will open one of them, and a Scroll of Ekash's Lock Splitter can be used for the other. The alternative route is simply to enter the Imperial Commission through the front door. The glove is behind the level 50 locked door. If you are not a member of the Imperial Legion, feel free to open the door via spell/lockpick, or pickpocket the key from Rufinus Alleius (who is in the Imperial Commission, too). If you are a Legion member, you will be expelled. Oddly, the Guards don't react to you at all in your attempts in unlocking the door. (You'll also find that you can steal with impunity from some other rooms in Ebonheart and its ambassadorial missions because many contain NPCs whose Alarm is all set to zero. They verbally protest but do nothing, and you get no Bounty.  It requires trial and error to determine the safe rooms, so save first.) To complete the quest, snatch the glove from the chest of drawers, and return with it to Ahnassi to talk about share a gift again. She'll let you keep the item. (It should be used with caution, as it has a permanent Damage Marksman effect, sufficient to reduce any character's skill to 0; you would probably not want to accidentally harm a follower NPC with it, especially one you intend to keep around, such as Fjorgeir.) This is all there is to Ahnassi's quests, though you will find that in her/your house, the two containers of food and drink will refill themselves after a while."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Alchemical_Formulas","Talk to Nileno Dorvayn about duties. Steal a copy of Aurane Frernis' secret alchemy formulas. Return it to Nileno for an increase in faction reputation.","Hlaalu Alchemy[edit] Nileno Dorvayn at the Hlaalu Council Manor in Balmora will ask you to steal a formula from an alchemist who has been taking business from a loyal Hlaalu alchemist in Vivec. The alchemist in question is Aurane Frernis in the Foreign Quarter's lower waistworks. Confusingly, her shop is indicated as Apothecary, not Alchemist, while there is another, unrelated Alchemist shop nearby, and the Foreign Quarter canton is called the ""Market Canton"" in the game's dialogue (no such canton actually exists). Aurane's Secret Formula[edit] Locations of the Scrolls You can find Aurane Frernis in the Foreign Quarter's lower waistworks. It may be very difficult to steal a recipe scroll without any magic. In all, there's one on the table, one in a chest at the foot of the bed, and one on Aurane herself. The chest is locked (40) and trapped, so non-thieves should avoid this one; the same goes for the one on Aurane. The easiest would be the one on the table; it's a small room, so there's little to hide behind when stealing the scroll. A chameleon spell or item would be useful since you can't hide anywhere in the room while stealing it. The lamp above Aurane Frernis' bed is enough to break line of sight to the alchemist and allow the recipe scroll on the table to be picked up using the Telekinesis spell. Once you've acquired the formula, return it to Nileno in Balmora with the recipe to complete the quest and receive a five point boost in faction reputation. An easy way to do this (especially early in the game) is to grab the scroll on the table and turn around immediately to leave the room (before she manages to do anything other than shout at you). You will have to pay a bounty of 100 (remember to drop all the stuff you've stolen, including the recipe scroll, if you choose to do the quest this way), but other than that all will be as before - she won't even be angry when you come back."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Alleius%27_Bounty","Speak to Lorbumol gro-Aglakh at the Guild of Fighters in Vivec for your orders. Travel to Ebonheart to collect a bounty on Rufinus Alleius. Find the magistrate at the Grand Council and kill him. Return to Lorbumol to complete the quest.","Orders[edit] Lorbumol gro-Aglakh in the Vivec Guild of Fighters asks you to collect yet another bounty on a magistrate (judge) in the Grand Council of Ebonheart, Rufinus Alleius. Alleius' Bounty[edit] Take a boat to Ebonheart and seek out the magistrate in the Grand Council Chambers. Asking around will reveal that he is actually in the Imperial Commission. Kill him and return to Lorbumol for your 1,000 gold bounty. You could try taunting before attacking; after five successful taunts or so at 0/100 disposition Rufinus Alleius starts attacking you."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Alms_from_the_Argonian_Mission","Talk to Iulus Truptor at the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart for a new almoner mission. Visit the Argonian Mission to collect some alms. Persuade Im-Kilaya to donate some gold. Return to Iulus to complete the quest.","Almoner Mission[edit] Iulus Truptor at the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart will ask you to perform a collection of donations from the Argonian Mission in town. Alms from the Argonian Mission[edit] If Im-Kilaya's disposition towards you is at least 50, he'll give you the whole 100 gold. However, if you find the slave On-Wan behind a locked (25) door, you can persuade Im-Kilaya to donate even more by asking about the ""Runaway slave"" before asking about ""Alms for the poor"". Finding the slave also causes Im-Kilaya's disposition to jump by 40 points. Alternatively, with high enough Speechcraft (and perhaps also if you have already returned Rabinna and/or Reeh-Jah here), you need not use blackmail. If his disposition is 80 or higher, Im-Kilaya will tell you this: ""The Imperial Cult has our respect. We are disappointed that the Imperial Cult does not speak out against the inhumane practices of slavery in Morrowind. But perhaps you are right. It is by demonstrating our superior commitment to civilization and humanity that we best disprove the Dunmer's barbaric insistence that we are no more than animals. Please accept this donation to the Imperial Cult on behalf of the province of Argonia."" after which he donates 200 gold. Approaching others in the Mission is fruitless; they apologize politely and direct you to speak to Im-Kilaya as their leader. Return to Iulus. If you raised only 100 gold, you will receive a five point disposition bump, five points of faction reputation and two Exclusive Fortify Luck Potions. At 200 gold you receive a ten point disposition bump, ten faction reputation points, and the magical Zenithar's Frock."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Alms_from_the_Skyrim_Mission","Talk to Iulus Truptor at the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart for a new almoner mission. Visit the Skyrim Mission to collect some alms. Persuade the members of the Mission to donate some gold. Return to Iulus to complete the quest.","Almoner Mission[edit] Iulus Truptor at the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart will ask you to collect alms from the Skyrim Mission in Ebonheart. Alms from the Skyrim Mission[edit] Be careful when asking for donations as you receive only one chance. Raise their Disposition before asking in order to receive a higher donation.  To be safe, you should raise it to at least 70 to get the most out of them (some only need to be raised to 60).  Heidmir alone will give up to 200 gold if he likes you enough -- 100 for his country, and 100 for himself. Here is a list of the people in the Skyrim Mission along with how much they will donate: Name Disp. Gold  Disp.

If you raised only 100 gold you'll receive a five point disposition bump with Iulus, five points of faction reputation, and two Bargain Fortify Personality Potions. However if you tell him you've ""DOUBLED it!"" he will be very pleased with you and gives you the Shoes of Conviction as well as ten points of faction reputation and disposition. Anything over 200 gold you get to keep, so it pays to try and get a good disposition with the NPCs first."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Alof_and_the_Orcs","Talk to Eydis Fire-Eye in the Balmora Guild of Fighters for orders. Talk to Alof the Easterner at his farmhouse for more information about some Orcs in a Daedric shrine. Head over to Ashunartes and kill Burub gra-Bamog. Return to Eydis Fire-Eye for reward.","Orders[edit] Eydis Fire-Eye in the Balmora Guild of Fighters will ask you to investigate some Orcs at a Daedric ruin for the Duke Vedam Dren himself. And that you should talk to Alof the Easterner, a local farmer for more information. Alof's Farmhouse[edit] Alof's Farmhouse is northeast of Pelagiad and north of the Arvel Plantation (a small hut on the north shore of Lake Amaya), just east of the Fields of Kummu. Alof tells you that the Orcs come from Ashunartes, a Daedric ruin northeast of there. He says that if you kill their leader, Burub gra-Bamog, the rest of the Orcs should leave the farmers in peace. Ashunartes[edit] The shrine is indeed towards the northeast of Alof's farm, just across the hills (though it's a little more north than east). There are two entrances to the shrine, with three Orcs in the bottom level, and Burub herself in the upper. You don't need to take care of the three Orcs on the bottom, but some of them have Orcish armor and other loot which can sell for a pretty penny, and they will still continue to attack you even after Burub is dead, so there's no particular reason to avoid killing them. Return to Eydis for your 500 drakes reward."

Return to Eddie to complete the quest.","Chores[edit] Once you recruit Fast Eddie and he arrives at the Telvanni Council Chamber in Sadrith Mora, he will ask you to give him five Standard Potions of Invisibility (home-made potions won't do) in order for him to retrieve a magical amulet from the mainland. There aren't any restocking merchants who sell the potion; however you can find a single bottle at many places. You can get one from Anis Seloth, the main alchemist in Sadrith Mora, Arangaer the alchemist with the stall outside Fara's Hole in the Wall also in Sadrith Mora, Nalcarya of White Haven at Balmora, Gils Drelas at Tel Branora, Jolda and Daynali Dren in Tel Mora. Lastly, you can find the potion with the Alchemists in the Mages Guild in Balmora, Vivec, Caldera and Ald'ruhn. Amulet of Unity[edit] Get five invisibility potions from a store or elsewhere.

Drothan is reluctant to yield anything useful at first, but raise his disposition to 50 and he'll tell you that his two ""escorts"" have stolen his shipment of Raw Glass. Of course, he asks you if you'd like to help and retrieve it. Find the Thieves[edit] The two escorts, Alvur Hleran and Dondir, ran southeast towards the cave Beshara. The cave actually houses a number of people of ill repute, including the two in question. Retrieve the Contraband[edit] The glass itself can be found in a locked chest at the very end of the cave. Pick the lock or get the key from Alvur (by any means necessary). When you return to Drothan with the 10 pieces of glass, you'll receive a bonus to your Mercantile skill. If you kill both thieves, you will get a 5-point bonus.  Killing only one of them nets you 3 points, and if you don't kill either of them, you'll only get a 2-point bonus.

Return to Caius Cosades. (Optional) Speak with Hasphat again to get the key which opens the lower levels of Arkngthand.","Hasphat Antabolis[edit] Your first task from Caius is to talk to Hasphat Antabolis about the Nerevarine and Sixth House cults. Antabolis can be found in the training room on the lower floor of the Balmora Fighters Guild in the center of town. However, he wants a favor before he gives you the information. All you have to do is obtain a Dwemer puzzle box from a local ruin called Arkngthand. Travel to Arkngthand[edit] Leave Balmora from the southern entrance, and head east. You will reach a fork in the road around Moonmoth Legion Fort, which has three roads to choose from. Head northeast towards Molag Mar. If you have chosen the correct path, you will soon approach an ancient Dwemer bridge crossing Foyada Mamaea. Snowy Granius, a bandit, waylays travelers on the bridge. Shortly after the end of the bridge, you will see a Dwemer ruin on your right. This is Arkngthand. Turn the crank handle, and proceed inside. Ruins of Arkngthand[edit] At the bottom level of the ruins are two bandits, Frink Ruuz and Surus Velvus. To find the puzzle box, face west, toward the three doors leading to Weepingbell Hall. Above those doors is a ledge, made accessible by a ramp made of rocks. Climb the ramp and enter the door to the Cells of Hollow Hand, on your left. The puzzle box is on the shelves, which is on the left when you enter the room. However, the boss of the bandits, Boss Crito, is also in there.  Once you have taken the puzzle box, you can return to Hasphat. You can also continue to explore the ruins but it has no bearing on the quest.

Return to Frernis with this information for your 100 gold reward. Alternatively, go and have a chat with Belan who owns an apothecary shop on the Waistworks level of Telvanni Canton.

Travel to Vivec to deliver the Letter from Ocato to Trebonius Artorius. Give the letter to Trebonius in the Foreign Quarter Guild of Mages and be promoted to Arch-Mage. Duel to the death: Either talk to Edwinna Elbert in the Ald'ruhn Guild of Mages to be directed to Trebonius or talk directly to Trebonius about becoming the Arch-Mage. Trebonius will challenge you to a duel to the death in the Arena. Defeat Trebonius to become Arch-Mage.","Becoming Arch-Mage[edit] In order to achieve your last guild rank of Arch-Mage you must replace Trebonius Artorius in the Vivec Guild of Mages as the guildmaster. This isn't much of a surprise if you're familiar with Trebonius; he seems a bit light headed to be head of the Guild. There are two ways of doing this: peacefully or by a duel to the death. Rising to Arch-Mage Peacefully[edit] Once you've finished the Galur Rithari's Papers quest for Skink-in-Tree's-Shade (in the Wolverine Hall Mage's Guild), and reached the rank of Master Wizard, talk with Skink to be given a letter from Ocato (spelled correctly this time) that amounts to Trebonius's pink slip (he's being fired by the Empire). In it, Ocato asks Trebonius to promote you to Arch-Mage. Trebonius will, but he won't step down; you end up both being Arch-Mages, and you get +2 Reputation bonus. The downside is the only way you can get his equipment is by doing the Dwemer and Telvanni quests he sets for you. Because of how the journal script progresses, once you have the letter, you won't be able to challenge him to a duel unless you have previously done so. If you do deliver the letter from Ocato and peacefully become Arch-Mage, you can still turn in Trebonius's quest Mystery of the Dwarves and receive his point of reputation reward. After which there is no additional value in keeping Trebonius alive. Using Taunt or Frenzy he can be fought and killed inside the Vivec Mage's Guild. This gives access to his equipment AND the maximum Reputation gain. Other NPCs and quests reference his death as if you had fought in the arena except you gain the 3 reputation points from the Mystery of the Dwarves and delivering Ocato's letter without having to sacrifice the valuable Necromancer's Amulet or killing the Telvanni Councilors. Duel With Trebonius[edit] Similarly, if you have finished the Bethamez quest for Edwinna Elbert (in the Ald'ruhn Guild of Mages), and reached the rank of Master Wizard, talk to Edwinna about duties and be directed to Trebonius in the Vivec Guild of Mages. He will greet you with a challenge to a duel to the death in the Vivec Arena. Alternatively, if you have reached the rank of Wizard in the Guild, you can talk directly to Trebonius about becoming the Arch-Mage. He will again challenge you to a duel to the death in the Arena. Either way, if you can manage to defeat him, you'll become the new Arch-Mage. You'll also get to keep his great equipment, but don't get any reputation points."

By accepting the title of Magister, you are announcing that you deserve the title of Archmagister more than Gothren, who currently holds that rank. Becoming Master[edit] If you choose to become Master, you won't be able to ascend to Archmagister of House Telvanni. However, if you change your mind later, you can ask Aryon to name you Magister. Becoming Archmagister[edit] If you choose to become Magister, Aryon will tell you that you have the support of the Telvanni Council, but you still have to dispose of Archmagister Gothren, who you will have to kill before taking his place (at this point you get +10 Disposition, +10 Faction Reputation and +2 Reputation, but only if you raised from the rank of Wizard).

Ask around Molag Mar to learn that his brothers have to bug him to get him to do anything. Find one of his brothers, Tidros Indaram, again in the Armigers Stronghold (upstairs), and he'll tell you to speak with Giras again and tell him that Tidros said to pay the debt. Giras will agree this time on one condition, that you must duel him to 'prove' that he owes the money. Once Giras is dead, knocked out, or takes enough damage, the duel will end (though try not to kill him as his brothers will not like it).

Guvron will attack you as soon as you mention the statue and you'll be forced to kill him. On his corpse you'll find a note signed Hanarai. Hanarai Assutlanipal[edit] Talk with Sarano about the note and he'll say he thinks it refers to Hanarai Assutlanipal who has a  house in Ald'ruhn. He gives you four Quality Restore Health potions, one Cure Blight Disease potion, and one Cure Common Disease potion, in case Hanarai turns out to be as violent as Guvron. Go in and Hanarai will attack you as soon as you mention the statue. Once she is dead, search her house, and you'll note that her cellar is a Sixth House shrine.

She instructs you to go there and see what they've found, as she believes that there may be plans similar to the ones you just brought her. Retrieve the Plans for Edwinna[edit] (If you have the Blood Moon expansion, see the Notes below for a ""shortcut."" If not, or if you want to continue the way the game had intended, continue reading.) Ask one of the citizens about Gnisis to unlock the egg mine subject. Then head for the mine on the east side of town on the hill and speak to the guard, Vatollia Apo, to get a key. If you're part of the Imperial Legion or in possession of a miner's pick he will let you in (if you don't have one, there is a pick on the ground in front of the pushcart next to him); otherwise persuade him, bribe him or sneak up to the door and pick the lock. Once you are in, the entrance to Bethamez can be found on the lower level. After defeating or invisibly sneaking past Lugrub gro-Ogdum, the Orc that guards the entry to the lower level, make your way past the Kwama Warriors taking the left path. The first door on your right is the door to Bethamez. Inside Bethamez, you may find the Dwemer Airship Plans on a table to the left of the entrance. Except the book Divine Metaphysics..., which is beneath the same table, there is nothing else of value in this ruin. Deliver the Plans to Edwinna[edit] After getting the plans, return to Edwinna and give the blueprints to her. You will be rewarded with an increase in Disposition, Faction Reputation, and a Reputation point."

He suggests that Eydis might betray the Camonna Tong if you offer her the Bittercup, an artifact sacred to the followers of Clavicus Vile. The artifact can be found in the ruins of Ald Redaynia, on the islands north of the Urshilaku Camp (it should be marked on your map). Recovering the Bittercup[edit] The outside of Ald Redaynia is guarded by two Skeleton Archers. The door to the right-hand side after entering (level 75 lock) leads to the Bittercup. The key to this door is in the lower area of the cave, on top of some crates (the key also opens the submerged chest in the same area where it is found). Open the locked door that leads to the Bittercup and defeat the four monsters. A Skeleton War-Wizard will appear after defeating these monsters. Loot the Skeleton War-Wizard's corpse for a Vampiric Ring. Examine the Bittercup on the central altar, and choose whether to drink from it or pick it up. The Bittercup will disappear forever after selecting the option to drink from it, but adds 20 pts to the highest attribute and subtracts 20 from the lowest attribute (the Bittercup is needed to finish the quest).

You can kill (or just knock out) Alven to get the ring, though if you raise his disposition above 60 you can get him to initiate a duel (or you can taunt him instead).

Travel to the completed statue at Khartag Point after 21 days and receive Goldbrand.","Boethiah's glory restored Boethiah's Request[edit] One of the Daedra, Boethiah, has a shrine that's more than a bit tricky to find. Why? Because it sank to the ocean floor. M'Aiq the Liar will tell you about this place if you meet him on his island in the Sheogorad region. Northwest of Hla Oad, on an island, there's a Daedric ruin called Ashurnibibi. If you check out the ocean a short distance west-northwest of the island, you'll find ruined Daedric buildings on the ocean's floor. Among them is the shattered Shrine of Boethiah. You can activate Boethiah's head, located a short distance from the rest of the statue, and initiate the quest. Activate the crumbled statue and Boethiah will speak to you: ""What do you want with me, mortal? My shrine is in ruins, my priests have forgotten me. Will you rebuild my shrine, mortal? Restore it in all its glory? Accomplish this, and I will reward you. You will be the bearer of Goldbrand, my sword of legend. There is one who can help you do this for me. Listen.... Rough hands to smooth stone, Carving rock instead of bone, In Caldera an artist waits, His masterpiece to create. Find the one who may shape the rock. Go."" Finding a Sculptor[edit] He wants his shrine rebuilt, and sends you to Caldera to find a sculptor. Ask around and you'll be directed to a shopkeeper named Verick Gemain, who in turn directs you to an Orc in Ghorak Manor across the street from his shop. The Orc, Duma gro-Lag, is on the third floor of the manor and requires 2000 gold and a copy of a book on the shrine (Boethiah's Glory, available in Jobasha's Rare Books in Vivec) to begin work. He tells you that it will take him several weeks to complete. After 21 days the shrine will be finished, although you get no journal entry saying it is done. Boethiah in all his Glory[edit] At that time, head to the rebuilt shrine—located at Khartag Point—and activate the statue. A word of caution, though: the statue has to be totally built in order for you to activate it, so venturing two days after the sculptor gets there will be pointless. The Daedric Prince will speak to you: ""You have done well. This shrine is a worthy one, and my power will again be felt. Take this, mortal. Wield the Goldbrand with a strong hand, and let all know that my Shrine has risen!"" You will be rewarded with Goldbrand, a one-handed longsword with impressive base damage and good fire damage."

Winged Twilights block the way Boots of the Apostle[edit] Go to Berandas with a good supply of Scrolls of Divine Intervention (you can buy as many as you want from the enchanter in Vivec's Mages Guild).

Choose the responses ""You are a foolish boy"", ""You are a ridiculous young man"", ""Stupid child"", ""You are too weak to be a vampire"", and ""You know nothing"". Each insult will lower his disposition and increase his option to fight, so by the last insult he will most likely attack you. If you are so charming that he does not attack, just taunt him until he does. At this point, you should remember his mother's words and actually let the boy win ... yes, this will be hard and contrary to most people's instinct, but don't fight back. (If you're a powerful warrior, it's quite easy to kill him in one blow. Also, it is advisable for powerful warriors to unequip their armor since his dagger may break before the fight is over.)

You may tell Trebonius that Tiram Gadar is the Telvanni spy (who is very likely to be the actual spy); however, since Tiram is Trebonius' most trusted advisor, Trebonius will deny the truth and ignore your accusation, and your disposition with Trebonius will go down by 5 if Tiram Gadar is still alive.

Getting Ranis Athrys in Trouble[edit] There's an alternate ending to the quest if you let Itermerel and Tashpi live (during the Escort Itermerel and Kill Necromancer Tashpi Ashibael quests, respectively). When you talk to Trebonius, lie to him and report that Ranis Athrys is the spy and she will be kicked out of the Guild, with you still getting credit for completing the quest. You will still receive a Reputation point this way, in addition to some Faction Reputation, but you'll miss out on the scrolls and dagger that Ranis would have given you."

Ajira will provide 10 gold to cover the purchase cost, and suggests to try Ra'Virr, a trader next door to the Guild; but any ceramic bowl will do. Return to Ajira[edit] Once you return to Ajira, she will immediately bring up the next quest, without prompting you to complete this one.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Chronicles_of_Nchuleft","Talk to Edwinna Elbert about duties, then Chronicles of Nchuleft. Locate and obtain the book in question. Return to Edwinna to complete the quest.","Duties[edit] Talk with Edwinna Elbert in the Ald'ruhn Guild of Mages about duties, and you'll find she is looking for a rare Dwemer book Chronicles of Nchuleft. None of the Guild halls have a copy, so she gives you 250 septims to go out and buy one, suggesting you try a bookseller. (The book's value is exactly 250 septims, and unless you've mastered your Mercantile skill, there will be a markup, so you'll have to spend some of your own cash on this.) Acquiring Chronicles of Nchuleft[edit] If you check the local bookshop in Ald'ruhn, Codus Callonus, the owner, suggests trying to find a copy in Vivec. Indeed, you can find a copy of the Chronicles of Nchuleft in Jobasha's Rare Books in Vivec, Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks (a light green book).  Copies of the book can also be found at the following: Vivec: Redoran Records, Redoran Canton (have to steal, but is in a room with no one to see you take it) Office of the Watch, Temple Canton (have to steal) Library of Vivec, Temple Canton (have to steal) Hall of Justice Secret Library, Temple Canton (have to steal) Dorisa Darvel, Bookseller, Balmora (for purchase) Holamayan Monastery (have to steal) Vasesius Viciulus, Trader, Molag Mar (for purchase) Llarar Bereloth's place in Sulipund (have to steal or take as part of plundering Sulipund after another Mages Guild quest) Nchuleft (free for the taking) Tureynulal (free for the taking, but very dangerous) For those with the Tribunal expansion installed, this book is also located on the top shelf of the office of an Elder in Almalexia's Temple behind the Royal Palace where you arrive after being teleported from Ebonheart. It is difficult to steal from this location without a Chameleon spell as there are 3-4 people in that room at all times. For those with the Bloodmoon expansion installed, this book can also be found in the Imperial Cult Shrine in Fort Frostmoth in the room where Antonius Nuncius is located. Deliver the Book to Edwinna[edit] Return to Edwinna and give her the book, and you'll be rewarded with an increase in disposition. If you already had the book in your inventory, she compliments you on your scholarship and efficiency, but won't give you the 250 gold."

Return to the Dagoth Ur Facility Caverns to meet Azura, view a cut scene, and receive a reward.","Vivec outlined a five-step plan to eliminate Dagoth Ur: Raids inside the Ghostfence, Raids upon Ash Vampire Citadels, Assault on Gate Citadel Vemynal, Assault on Gate Citadel Odrosal, and Assault on Citadel Dagoth. Phase 1: Raids inside the Ghostfence[edit] Enter either tower at the Ghostgate and ask a Buoyant Armiger for a Map of Red Mountain using the topic ""inside the Ghostfence"" (must be a Buoyant Armiger and not an Ordinator). Scout the Red Mountain region inside the Ghostfence to become familiar with the area's locations and monsters. Phase 2: Raids upon Ash Vampire Citadels[edit] This phase is optional. However, the following artifacts can be obtained by defeating the seven Ash Vampires: Belt of Heartfire, Amulet of Heartthrum, Amulet of Heartrime, Amulet of Heartheal, Amulet of Heartfire, Soul Ring, and Blood Ring. The artifacts are not required to beat Dagoth Ur, but can be of great use against his magic attacks. Ruins of Kogoruhn[edit] Kogoruhn, one of the Ash Vampire Citadels Main article: Kogoruhn The weakest Ash Vampire, Dagoth Uthol, is in Kogoruhn. Other than the main entrance to the ruins, there is also a doorway inside the northwest area of the Ghostfence. Dagoth Uthol can be found in the Charma's Breath area, and holds the Belt of Heartfire. If Dagoth Uthol was previously defeated during The Path of the Incarnate quest, then the journal stage will not be recorded. Citadel Vemynal[edit] See the Dagoth Vemyn and the Sunder Artifact section. Citadel Endusal[edit] Main article: Endusal Dagoth Endus is in Endusal, located to the northwest of the Ghostgate. He holds the Amulet of Heartrime. Citadel Odrosal[edit] Odrosal See the Dagoth Odros and the Keening Artifact section. Citadel Tureynulal[edit] Main article: Tureynulal Dagoth Tureynul is in Tureynulal, located to the northeast of Dagoth Ur. He can be found in Kagrenac's Library, and holds the Amulet of Heartthrum. If Dagoth Tureynul was previously defeated during the Tribunal Temple quest Cleaver of St. Felms, then the journal stage will not be recorded. Citadel Dagoth[edit] See the Dagoth Gilvoth section. Mamaea[edit] Main article: Mamaea Dagoth Araynys is in Mamaea, located to the southeast of Gnisis. He can be found in the Sanctum of Black Hope, and holds the Soul Ring. There is also some unique loot in the Shrine of Pitted Dreams bell chamber, including the Daedric Face of Inspiration and the Fang of Haynekhtnamet. Phase 3: Assault on Gate Citadel Vemynal[edit] Vemynal is located to the northwest of Dagoth Ur. Vivec marks the location of this citadel on the map after talking to him about the plan to defeat Dagoth Ur. Dagoth Vemyn and the Sunder Artifact[edit] Sunder Dagoth Vemyn can be found in the Hall of Torque (lower level), and holds the Amulet of Heartheal and Sunder artifacts. Phase 4: Assault on Gate Citadel Odrosal[edit] Odrosal is located to the southeast of Dagoth Ur. Vivec marks the location of this citadel on the map after talking to him about the plan to defeat Dagoth Ur. Dagoth Odros and the Keening Artifact[edit] Keening Dagoth Odros can be found in the Dwemer Training Academy (Level 2), and holds the Amulet of Heartfire and Dagoth Odros's Key. The Keening artifact can be found in the Tower area of Odrosal. The door to the Tower can be unlocked with Dagoth Odros's Key. Phase 5: Assault on Citadel Dagoth[edit] Dagoth Ur Citadel The Dagoth Ur Facility is located in the center of Red Mountain. Before assaulting the facility, three Dwemer artifacts are required: Wraithguard (gauntlet received from Vivec), Sunder (warhammer obtained in Citadel Vemynal), and Keening (short blade obtained in Citadel Odrosal). The easiest path to the citadel is to the southeast, and runs between Odrosal and the Yanemus Mine. The Outer Facilities entrance is blocked by a spherical door that can be opened with a hand crank found on a pipe to the south of the entrance. Dagoth Gilvoth[edit] Dagoth Gilvoth can be found in the Lower Facility of Dagoth Ur, and holds the Blood Ring. Dagoth Ur[edit] Dagoth Ur can be found in the Facility Cavern. He will not be hostile at first, and says it is up to you to make the first blow (although he may still attack first after a short period of time). Talk with him for a bit to gain some information, then attack when ready. There's no secret tactic to killing him the first time; just hit/cast hard and he should fall shortly. He will eventually disappear, leaving the Heart Ring near the entrance to Akulakhan's Chamber. Akulakhan[edit] The Heart of Lorkhan Once you enter Akulakhan's Chamber, you cannot leave by any means until the Heart of Lorkhan is destroyed, so make sure you are prepared. Heal up and equip Wraithguard, then Sunder. Dagoth Ur and his minions will attack immediately after entering the chamber. Dagoth Ur is effectively invincible at this stage, so you should ignore him and focus on reaching the Heart, which is found in the center of the great Dwemer golem, Akulakhan. It is possible to get Dagoth Ur out of the way temporarily by luring him off the cliff into the lava with Levitate. It's best to use Levitate or Slowfall to reach Akulakhan. Be aware that Dagoth Ur will teleport onto the bridge the first time you approach the heart. Strike the Heart of Lorkhan once with Sunder, then five times with Keening to destroy it. As soon at the Heart is destroyed, Akulakhan begins to collapse, so quickly run back across the bridge or get away by other means or you may be sent plummeting into the lava below. Dagoth Ur is now mortal, although you do not need to kill him yourself and he may fall into the lava and die as Akulakhan collapses on top of him. In any case, the destruction of Akulakhan ends his reign of terror. Azura's Reward[edit] Dagoth Ur after the blight Destroying the Heart unseals the door through which you entered the chamber, which can be re-opened by a crank on the pipes in front of it. Follow the ledge back around to the top (or fly up) and open the door. As you leave the cavern where you first met Dagoth Ur, Azura will appear before you and a cutscene will begin, outlining your accomplishments and revealing that with Dagoth Ur's death the blight plaguing the land is gone. She will leave the Ring of Azura on the ground, which will disappear after leaving the area. When the ring is picked up, a misnamed spell called Hand of Dagoth (with ID hand of azura) will be cast on you. This spell is a 100 pts Restore Attributes spell (restores all attributes except Personality and Intelligence). There will be no more blight or ash storms, though some creatures may still be affected. Any remaining Ash Vampires will perish in their lairs, leaving behind their unique artifacts. Sleepers in towns will also wake from their nightmare. Congratulations! You have finished Morrowind's Main Quest!"

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Corprus_Cure","Return to Caius in Balmora and talk with him to learn of a possible Corprus cure. Travel to Tel Fyr, give Divayth Fyr the Dwemer artifact, and talk with him. Retrieve the Dwemer Boots of Flying from Yagrum Bagarn deep within the Corprusarium. Receive the cure from Divayth.","Finding Divayth Fyr[edit] During the last quest to destroy the Sixth House base near Gnaar Mok, you contracted the apparently incurable Corprus Disease. While you have Corprus, the disposition of anyone you talk to will drop significantly, so it's a good idea to return to Caius as soon as possible. Back in Balmora, Caius is shocked to hear of your condition, but believes there may be hope. He has learned from Fast Eddie, a local Telvanni expert, that a Telvanni wizard named Divayth Fyr runs a Corprusarium deep beneath his tower in Tel Fyr, dedicated to the study of Corprus disease, and is your best chance for a cure. Apparently, Fyr is a collector of Dwemer artifacts, and Caius provides you with a Dwemer Coherer to help raise Divayth's disposition. You will also receive 1000 gold to pay for your expenses and a few levitation potions for use in the tower. The artifact weighs 40 pounds, so be sure you're able to carry that much. Tel Fyr is on an island in the eastern archipelago of Vvardenfell, in the Azura's Coast Region. Caius will mark it on your map if you ask him about it, and suggests you speak with Sondryn Irathi at the Sadrith Mora Fighters Guild for detailed directions. The fastest way to get there is to take a Guild Guide over to Sadrith Mora; alternatively, you can take a boat to Sadrith Mora from Ebonheart. Meet with Divayth Fyr[edit] Once inside Tel Fyr, Onyx Hall, you should talk to Beyte Fyr, a Dark Elf woman, across from the entrance to find out that Divayth is in his study, accessible by the main fly well. The fly well is upstairs in the Hall of Fyr, inside and to the right of the entrance. If you need more Levitation or Invisibility potions, you can steal them from a shelf in the bedroom on the main floor of the Hall of Fyr. Levitate up and find Divayth, dressed in Daedric armor and standing in front of a purple crystal. Give him the Dwemer artifact and ask him about corprus disease. You may have to additionally raise his Disposition through persuasion or other means in order to get him to talk to you. Divayth has plenty to say about the disease, but mention that you may fulfill the Nerevarine Prophecies and he will quickly offer you an experimental and possibly fatal cure for Corprus. However, before he agrees to give you the cure, he will ask you to fetch a pair of enchanted boots from Yagrum Bagarn in the Corprusarium below and return them to him. On the face of it, this is a menial chore, but Fyr's real intention is for you to see the place in which you will spend the rest of your life if the cure doesn't work. If you have angered Divayth previously by killing some of the members of the Corprusarium, you may be able to persuade him to assist you, either with conversation or magic, but if you have killed the warden, he and his daughters will attack you when you talk to them. Sometimes Divayth is extremely mad about what you have done, and presents you with no conversation options except ""Goodbye"". Fortifying your personality may fix this issue, changing his greeting dialogue to allow you to speak with him. The best way to achieve this is by using several Telvanni Bug Musk potions, which can be bought from Cienne Sintieve. If all else fails, you can use the console to advance the quest by entering SetJournalIndex A2_3_CorprusKiller 30. The Corprusarium[edit] Yagrum Bagarn The Corprusarium is downstairs, through the Onyx Hall. Before you enter, you will encounter the warden Vistha-Kai who will tell you not to harm the inmates, though they certainly have no qualms about hurting you. This is a good place for Invisibility or Chameleon if you have it, or a good Sneak skill. If you have Drain Fatigue or Damage Fatigue magic, you can use that (or the Hand-to-hand skill) to knock out the Corprus Stalkers and Lame Corpruses in the area, without triggering any alarm on the part of the Fyrs or Vistha-Kai (even if you injure the Corprus creatures a bit while knocked out, as long as you kill none of them and hit them with no weapons or damaging spells). The easiest strategy may be to simply run past the Corprus victims and head straight for the Corprusarium Bowels while ignoring any attacks. Fortunately, once you enter the Corprusarium Bowels, none of the inmates you encounter will be hostile towards you. Yagrum is in the central cave, and is hard to miss. He will give you the Dwemer Boots of Flying and has some interesting comments on the disappearance of the Dwemer. Once you have the boots, there is a trick to getting the Corprus victims not to attack you on the way out. Uupse Fyr, who may be found near Yagrum, will tell you that she can calm the victims with soothing drum rhythms if you find and bring her a guarskin drum which the inmates are prone to walk off with. Any guarskin drum will do, but unless you happen to have brought one with you you'll need to find the one in the Corprusarium. Return it to Uupse, and you will be able to leave the Corprusarium unmolested. Alternatively, you can use the same tactics you used on the way in to return straight to the Corprusarium entrance. The Cure?[edit] Return to Divayth, give him the boots, and accept the potion. It turns out that the potion doesn't actually cure you, but just removes the negative effects of the disease. Therefore, you have the complete disease resistance that Corprus gives, but no loss of attributes. Note that most of the 1000 gold Caius gave you wasn't needed (depending on how you got to Tel Fyr), meaning you're a bit richer too. You can now return to Caius in Balmora for the next stage of the main quest. If you return to Fyr at a later point in the game, he will tell you that the potion doesn't seem to work on the rest of his cases and that he killed two of his most desperate patients while testing it. Apparently you are an exceptional case, though as you may have found out, the Nerevarine is supposedly protected from death by prophecy."

Return to Quarra.","The Cult of Lord Irarak[edit] The Quarra Clan leader, Volrina Quarra, at the bottom of Druscashti, will ask you to kill the vampire Irarak who has set himself up as a god. Slaying the fiend[edit] Irarak can be found in the Ginith Ancestral Tomb, southwest from Ald Velothi. The tomb is small and you should quickly find Irarak inside. You won't actually be attacked immediately and can chat with Irarak and five of his 'followers'. You now have a choice whether to kill him or let him bribe you. If you follow the bribe route, you'll be 1000 gold richer but once you return to Volrina, her disposition drops 30 points and you are kicked out of the Clan, so this is obviously not the recommended route. You can however take the bribe and kill everyone anyway and you won't be kicked out of the clan. Return to Volrina once Irarak is dead to receive access to the Clan's services (Areas and Kjeld). If you already killed Irarak, Volrina still gives you the choice of whether or not to take the quest, but lets you straight into the clan if you accept."

(Optional) Find a rare document, The Private Papers of Galur Rithari, Buoyant Armiger. Travel to Bal Ur and speak to the statue of Molag Bal. Travel to Dubdilla and slay his daughter, Molag Grunda, and her atronach consort, Nomeg Gwai. Return to Molag Bal's statue to receive the cure.","Getting a clue[edit] You can talk with many people across Vvardenfell on the topic of vampirism, and vampirism cure to receive a wide variety of advice. Mages and sorcerers will suggest you read the rare book Vampires of Vvardenfell, v II, which you may have come across in your travels or through a number of quests. This volume has actually been banned by the Tribunal Temple, explaining its rarity. If you don't have the book, seek out Skink-in-Tree's-Shade in the Mages Guild at the Wolverine Hall or any bookseller to learn more about it and be directed to Jobasha's Rare Books. Retrieving the book is actually a task that Skink will give you as part of the Mages Guild quests. The few copies that do exist can be found at: Jobasha's Rare Books, Foreign Quarters Waistworks in Vivec (look for it on the top level, large red book). Hall of Justice Secret Library in Vivec. Mawia, a wizard's lair southeast of Molag Mar. Odirniran, east of Molag Mar. Vas, far west of Dagon Fel. Tel Vos' Central Tower. Galom Daeus, west of Tel Uvirith (in the Observatory-levitation needed). Tureynulal, Kagrenac's Library, west of Dagoth Ur. Even more clues[edit] Even though this book contains some clues as to what to do to cure yourself of vampirism, this quest is not really activated until you also find a much rarer document, The Private Papers of Galur Rithari, Buoyant Armiger, which can only be found in Galom Daeus, Tureynulal, and the Hall of Justice Secret Library (hidden under a book near the Ordinator). Maybe Molag Bal will help?[edit] Either source should spell out the steps required to be cured of the disease. You must first travel to the Daedric shrine at Bal Ur, north of Suran. Enter the shrine and inside speak with Derar Hlervu who will tell you to speak with the statue.   But first, help a concerned father out[edit] The statue, Molag Bal, will ask you to travel to the cave Dubdilla and kill his daughter, Molag Grunda, and her atronach consort, Nomeg Gwai (levitation is important). Molag Bal is apparently displeased about the company his daughter has been keeping.  A Cure for Vampirism[edit] Return to the shrine once the pair are dead and your Vampirism will be permanently cured. You will lose all the skills and attributes gained when you became a vampire and the amulet you got from your clan will no longer teleport you to your clan's hideout. Your character cannot become a vampire again (you can still contract Porphyric Hemophilia, you just won't turn into a vampire three days later).  Notes[edit] Molag Bal erroneously states that Dubdilla is below Mt. Assarnibibi. This error is further made apparent with ESO, with Dubdil Alar Tower built on top of where Dubdilla would later be. If you do not plan on becoming a vampire to complete this quest, you can ""finish"" it by using the Journal Console Command (Journal MS_VampireCure 50). You will not be able to become a vampire again and the path to Molag Grunda in the cavern Dubdilla will be blocked by rocks. Quest Stages[edit] The following Journal ID and Index codes can be used with the Journal console command to manually update the quest to a certain point.   A Cure for Vampirism (MS_VampireCure)  Index Finishes Quest Journal Entry 10I have found a [sic] some papers by a Buoyant Armiger, Galur Rithari. In them, he gives hints as to how vampirism may be cured. It suggests that the cure may be obtained with the help of a Daedra Prince, perhaps Molag Bal. 20In Molag Bal's shrine in Bal Ur, I spoke with Derar Hlervu. She has told me that she knows of no cure for vampirism, and that only the Daedra Lord himself will be able to help me. 30I have spoken to Molag Bal through his statue in the shrine at Bal Ur. He tells me that he does not have the cure for my vampirism, but he will get it for me if I do him a favor. His daughter, Molag Grunda, has been consorting with a Frost Atronach named Nomeg Gwai. If I can kill the two of them, returning their souls to a realm where Molag Bal may punish them, Molag Bal will give me the cure. They live now in the cave Dubdilla, south of Vos. 40I have succeeded in killing Molag Grunda and her paramour, Nomeg Gwai. 50Finishes questI've returned to the Shrine of Molag Bal and spoken with the Daedra Lord. He was pleased with my efforts, and has retrieved the cure from the Daedra Vaermina."

An alternative is to kill Orvas, thus removing the Camonna Tong's influence from House Hlaalu: but Vedam will obviously not be pleased at this, since Orvas is his brother (although he will do no more than indicate his displeasure, and still give you the Grandmastership).

The mine is northeast of the Dunmer stronghold Falensarano on the mainland, west of Tel Aruhn (ask him about Falensarano to have it marked on your map). The Problems[edit] Novor is found just inside with a few miners and tells you that they have had problems with Nix-Hounds attacking the miners and have lost their healer, Teres Arothan. You are to go down into the mine and bring back Teres if he's still alive. Rescuing Teres[edit] Teres can be found down the mine, along with a few Nix-Hounds of course. Talk to him in order to escort him back to Novor. Once you reach Novor, Teres will stop following you, and if you speak with Novor you will receive four pieces of raw glass as a reward.

Speak to her to learn that she was separated from her husband when they were attacked by several nix-hounds. Falanu believes that her husband, Drerel fled west. Eliminate the Threat[edit] Kill several hounds in the area west-northwest of the wife. Drerel is hiding behind some boulders further northwest, not too far from Falanu. If you are having trouble finding him, look for a three way junction in the road and then travel north. Speak to him and lead him back to his wife to receive a copy of A Dance in Fire, Chapter 2, a Block skill book. If you happen to find Drerel before Falanu, you should be able to complete the quest as well (in that case, you start the quest by speaking with Drerel and Falanu won't have any unique dialogue)."

Donation from Cunius Pelelius[edit] Cunius can be found just inside the door to the Governor's Hall. You can talk to him, and persuade him all you want, but you'll find he won't agree to give anything to you. There are two ways of blackmailing him into donating the pledge: Of all the people in the Hall, only Olumba gro-Boglar in the South Hall upstairs will be of any assistance. Olumba will tell you that Cunius is solving his money troubles by skimming from the ebony mine and smuggling ebony. If you visit the mine to the southwest of Caldera and speak with the slaves, this rumor will be verified (you may need to persuade the slaves to talk). Return to Cunius with this information. If you go through the door to your right (if standing behind his desk) and go up the stairs, you'll come to Odral Helvi's bedroom. You can go through the door on the left and up the stairs also, you end up in Odral Helvi's office, just continue on to the next room. You need a pretty good Security skill, but there is a chest with a ledger in it for the mine. Take the book back to Cunius and use the option ""show him the book"". Both ways will squeeze three pieces of Raw Ebony from him, which you should be able to sell for more than 500 gold (depending on your Mercantile skill).

On the Haj-Ei topic, you will be directed to the slave trader Dranas Sarathram in town. If you have an intelligence of 70 or above, his mention of the Argonian language will trigger you to realize that Hides-His-Eyes is just a direct translation of the Argonian name Haj-Ei.

Return to Baladas to complete the quest.","Chores[edit] Baladas Demnevanni at Arvs-Drelen in Gnisis will ask you to find three books: Nchunak's Fire and Faith, Chronicles of Nchuleft, and Antecedants of Dwemer Law. Fortunately, though the books are rare, they are not terribly difficult to find. Buying the Books[edit] If you have the money, the easiest method is to simply buy the books from Dorisa Darvel in Balmora (who has both Chronicles of Nchuleft and Nchunak's Fire and Faith), and Jobasha's Rare Books in the Foreign Quarter in Vivec (who has both Chronicles of Nchuleft and Antecedants of Dwemer Law). If you have some spare gold, Ethes Evos at Arobar Manor in Ald'ruhn will sell you a copy of Antecedants of Dwemer Law for 300 gold.  While he claims it's much less than the book is worth, the actual base value of the book is 25 gold, and while you won't get it for that price unless you're a real master of Mercantile, it will still be much less than the non-negotiable 300 he will charge for it. Stealing the Books[edit] All three books can be found in the Tribunal Temple's secret library in Vivec; and in the Holamayan Monastery. The Tribunal Temple's Secret Library in Vivec is a difficult route. It is well hidden, cracking its locks will be a crime if observed, and once inside you'll have to watch out for the Ordinator guards when you steal the books. Holamayan Monastery is found on a large but distant and obscure island on the east of the map, far north of the Shrine of Azura. You may have already found it as a part of the Main Quest (you can also reach it via a boat from Ebonheart's docks, but only after having advanced fairly far in the Main Quest). Unfortunately its entrance is only available at the hours of dawn and dusk.  The books are guarded by monks, whom you are supposed to have as allies (eventually if not yet), so stealing from them needs stealth, as at the Secret Library. The Temple in Gnisis also conveniently has two copies of Antecedants of Dwemer Law. See the individual book links for more locations. Delivering the Books[edit] Return to Baladas with the three books to complete the quest and receive a number of his 'trinkets' as a reward. This includes: Ondusi's Key, Amulet of Admonition, Second Barrier Belt, and the Surefeet shoes."

Voodoo[edit] He asks you to plant a magic item, a Dwarven Bone, in a chest near her bed in an attempt to lower her sales. You can find the chest in Jeanne's locked back room, so the trick here is to unlock that door without Jeanne seeing you. If she sees you, then you will get Journal entry 55 and will be unable to finish the quest. You can either count on your own Sneak skill, use a helpful Chameleon spell or item, or get the key on the table in the left corner of the shop (which also requires sneaking).

Hrundi suggests to avoid the guards as he doesn't need further trouble with the Telvanni. Killing Engaer[edit] Tel Naga Great Hall is just north of Wolverine Hall. There are two entrances into the Upper Tower, one high up from outside and one from inside the Lower Tower. You will need some form of levitation to reach either entrance. Engaer can be found in the northwest room of three trapped and locked (20) doors in the Upper Tower. The area is guarded by a single guard who is very close by, doesn't wander and stares you down continuously. You can taunt the guard into attacking if your sneak skill isn't high enough to untrap and unlock the door(s) undetected.  Several residents hold a Key to Tel Naga, which will open this door. Once you get in the room you should be able to finish Engaer off without interruptions. The easiest way is to taunt him into attacking. If you use a Chameleon spell you should be able to sneak behind him and attack without alerting the entire tower; a high level of Sneak can be used to similar effect, especially if you kill him in a single blow. A low-effort exploit that will ensure his demise (without much risking your own) is simply to attack once to get him to chase you, then run and jump over the hole leading to the lower floors of the tower.

Canctunian's disposition only needs to be at 75 to convince him, and he'll agree to contract with House Hlaalu for another year. Option 2: Shut down Sudanit Mine[edit] Travel to Sudanit Mine, southeast of the Buckmoth Legion Fort. Once there, find Darns Tedalen in a chamber at the back of the mine and dispose of him. There are a number of Redoran guards along the way: plenty of witnesses to report an unprovoked murder. You can avoid getting a bounty by either taunting him or casting Frenzy Humanoid. Alternatively, you could climb onto the stone ramp going to the upper ebony deposit where he is standing and carefully stick to the walls; you'll reach a point where you can shoot at him with a ranged weapon. Doing this keeps you inaccessible, safe and undetected as the guards will not raise an alarm. However, it requires good timing; saves at the right points are advisable. Resume attacking only when Darns and his men run to attack you. Consider using Resist Shock in your fight against Darns. He will start with strong area-of-effect shock spells, before switching to melee combat with a dagger. If you're a ranged fighter, attack him until he runs out of magicka, then continue hitting him while maintaining your distance. The mine is a sloped tunnel, so if you have high enough speed, you can force him to chase you uphill while you keep attacking him. Just be careful not to hit any of the other people in the mine or you'll have quite the mess on your hands! Completing the Quest[edit] Return to Nileno in Balmora to complete the quest and receive your reward of 1,000 gold. You also get a point of Reputation, ten points of Hlaalu faction reputation and Nileno's disposition rises 20 points. If you perform both tasks, Nileno will also reward you with a pair of glass boots, glass greaves and a glass cuirass, plus you get an extra point of reputation, five more points of Hlaalu reputation, and five extra points of disposition. This is the last piece of House Hlaalu business that Nileno will have for you; she will now refer you to Crassius Curio in Curio Manor, Hlaalu Canton in Vivec, or Edryno Arethi in the Hlaalu Canton Waistworks in Vivec, for further instructions."

Talk to Manirai and Gulakhan Han-Ammu. Give (or show) Han-Ammu the War Axe of Airan Ammu, Sanit-Kil's Heart of Fire, and the Robe of Erur-Dan the Wise; and convince him to become Ashkhan. Be named Nerevarine of the Erabenimsun Tribe.","The Erabenimsun Camp[edit] If you haven't found out the location of the Erabenimsun Camp yet, return to the Urshilaku Camp and find out from the Ashlanders. The camp is located a little southwest of the village of Tel Fyr, south of Tel Aruhn. The quickest way would be to grab a boat to Tel Aruhn or a Guild Guide to Wolverine Hall (Sadrith Mora) and then head southwest to the camp. Internal Disagreement[edit] Speaking with either resident of the Ashkhan's yurt results in a brief response and a disposition drop when mentioning the Nerevarine or prophecies. Go and talk to the Wise Woman, Manirai, in her yurt. Make sure you ask her about Nerevarine prophecies. She explains that Ulath-Pal and his allies hate all outlanders and will never agree to call you Nerevarine. She suggests a simple course of action. Kill Ulath-Pal and His Supporters[edit] In order to be named Nerevarine of the Erabenimsun, you must first kill Ashkhan Ulath-Pal and his supporters, Ahaz, Ranabi, and Ashu-Ahhe. Ulath-Pal and Ahaz are both in Ulath-Pal's Yurt. They are the strongest of the four, and both cast spells. Ulath-Pal drops the War Axe of Airan Ammu and Ahaz drops Sanit-Kil's Heart of Fire. Ranabi is in his Yurt and should be defeated quickly to prevent him from casting spells. He drops the Robe of Erur-Dan the Wise. Ashu-Ahhe is next door in his Yurt, and deals a moderate amount of damage. Persuading Gulakhan Han-Ammu[edit] Visit Manirai after dealing with Ulath-Pal and his supporters to find out that Gulakhan Han-Ammu must be persuaded to name you Nerevarine of the Erabenimsun. She warns that it may be difficult to convince him. Go and speak with Han-Ammu. He explains that he doesn't want the title of Ashkhan because he lacks three basic attributes of a warrior: strength, courage and wisdom. To make up for his lack of attributes, he wants the magic items that belonged to his now deceased tribe members: the War Axe of Airan Ammu, Sanit-Kil's Heart of Fire, and the Robe of Erur-Dan the Wise. Choose to offer him the magic items or show them to him. There are three possible outcomes: if his disposition and your Speechcraft are 50 or higher, show him an item and you'll convince him after some dialogue, if his disposition is 90 or higher and your Speechcraft is lower than 50, you'll have to give him all three items, but you get to keep the last one discussed (it is possible to place the desired item on the ground before speaking to him and then pick it up after handing over the other two items), or give him all three items. Named as Nerevarine[edit] With the magic items sorted out, Han-Ammu will accept his responsibilities as Ashkhan and name you Nerevarine of the Erabenimsun. Visit Manirai to receive the tribe's enchanted symbol, The Seizing of the Erabenimsun. If all three Great Houses have pronounced you as Hortator and all four Ashlander Tribes have named you Nerevarine, head over to the Temple Canton in Vivec for the next part of the quest."

Either steal the real deed and replace it or speak to Crassius Curio or Rovone Arvel. If you speak to Rovone or Crassius, speak to Baren Alen to get a copy of the real deed. Return to Odral Helvi.","Business[edit] Odral Helvi in the Governor's Hall in Caldera will ask you to replace some ""erroneous"" land deeds for the Ascadian Isles he has found in the Hlaalu Records in Vivec. The deed he gives you is obviously fake. There is now a choice between three paths: you can either steal the real deed from the records, report it to Crassius Curio, or bring it to the attention of the seller, Rovone Arvel. Option #1: Reporting to Curio[edit] If you talk to Curio about the matter and give him the fake deed, he'll reward you with an Amulet of Domination. You can then talk to Baren Alen in the Hlaalu Treasury Vaults about ""erroneous documents"" and he will sell you a copy of the real deed Helvi requested for ten gold. Helvi will believe you replaced the fake deed. Curio's disposition towards you increases by ten points if you take this option. Option #2: Reporting to Arvel[edit] Another option is to take the deed to Rovone Arvel, at his plantation north of Vivec. He will be very appreciative of your efforts and reward you with a Murdrum Ring. You can then talk to Baren Alen about making a copy of the real deed as above. Arvel's disposition jumps by 15 if you do this. Option #3: Stealing the Deed[edit] Stealing the deed isn't too difficult. It can be found in the Hlaalu Records office in the Hlaalu Canton in Vivec. Go through the Hlaalu Treasury in the waistworks to access the Records office, either directly or through the Hlaalu Vaults. The deed is in a small chest on the middle shelf of one of the bookcases. Valvosa Maryon will likely be nearby, so it requires a few skills in Sneak (Chameleon works great too). Take out the Ascadian Isles Land Deed and (if actually complying with Odral Helvi's shady mission for you) put in Odral's Land Deed. Ending the Quest[edit] Return to Helvi with the real or copied land deed to complete the quest. You will receive six scrolls (2 Scroll of Uth's Hand of Heaven, 2 Scroll of The Black Storm, 2 Scroll of Tranasa's Spelltwist) for completing the quest."

To this end, she sends you to escort him to the Halfway Tavern in Pelagiad (northwest of Vivec, just north of Seyda Neen), but she makes it clear that the notes are all that actually matter. Itermerel's Notes[edit] This quest has several possible outcomes. If you're feeling lazy and you have a high Sneak skill, you can simply pickpocket the notes while Itermerel is still in the Eight Plates. This way saves you the trouble of escorting him all the way to Pelagiad. Another alternative is to agree to escort the High Elf and start on the road to Pelagiad. Once you're safely out of Balmora and away from the guards that patrol the streets there, you can kill Itermerel without penalty. Just strip his corpse of his notes and head back to Ranis. Of course, there is always the option of escorting him all the way to Pelagiad. Travelling together to Seyda Neen by a silt strider can save a lot of time and trouble.

Finding the Lost Pilgrim[edit] Travel to Gnisis using the silt strider. Head to the cave, which is to the south of Gnisis along the coast. Once there, go northeast along a path until you find Tharen. Curing Tharen[edit] Apparently, Tharen is sick and cannot make the journey back to Gnisis. He asks that you report his location so he can be cured. At this point, you can cure him using a spell or a potion. If you don't have a potion, you can return to Lloros Sarano, who will give you one and send you back to Fedris Tharen.

Though no one at Gnisis will know anything, the villagers in Maar Gan have a different story. They will tell you that an ash storm delayed the trader, and some in the Andus Tradehouse will report seeing him near the Rothan Ancestral Tomb just west of town.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Fjol_the_Outlaw","Talk to Larrius Varro, ask him about latest rumors and careless travelers. Travel to north of Hla Oad. Kill Fjol. Return to Varro for the bounty.","Fjol the Outlaw[edit] If you have a high enough disposition with Larrius Varro (30), ask him about latest rumors, and he will reveal that a Nord has been attacking careless travelers near Hla Oad. Confronting the Road Agent[edit] Head over to the town and find Fjol near the bridge north of town. Speak to him about murderous outlaws and he will demand that you give him 100 gold, basically confirming that indeed he is (if your disposition is higher than 40, he'll ask more politely). If you give him the gold you can return to Varro and report Fjol's position, but you will not receive any reward. If you refuse to give Fjol the 100 gold, he will attack and you will be forced to kill him. Be careful when choosing this option, however, as he can easily one-shot low-level players. If you encounter him early on (which most players will) it might be wise to avoid talking to him altogether until you have gained a few levels and can safely return to kill him. Note that you don't have to talk to him at all in order to progress the quest and can instead attack him at will, making things easier for ranged characters/spellcasters. Once he's dead, return to Varro for a 100 gold reward."

If you persuade them sufficiently (disposition 60) you'll also learn that he is in the tower's General Quarters. You'll have to find and kill Berengeval to get the amulet.

Directions[edit] The quickest route is to take a Silt Strider up to Khuul, a ship to Dagon Fel, then on to Tel Mora and Vos before trekking southwest to the mine (it is indeed directly west of the Zainab Camp in the mountains). If, however, you've already obtained the Master Index, simply teleport to Caldera Mage's Guild (via Guild Guide) and speak to Folms Mirel to teleport to Falensarano, heading North towards Zainab camp. Using the Zainab Camp as a reference point, take the path north away from camp and it will immediately turn west.

The only hostile creatures are a few rats. Dangor will gladly accept the flin. If you're careful, you can steal some Raw Ebony, but if anyone sees you take it they will attack you.

Return after ten days for your reward.","For the Love of a Bosmer[edit] If you are thorough or lucky, you might find a love letter in the southern planter (among some mushrooms, closest to the No Name Club) on the Hlaalu Canton Plaza. The letter is from Gadayn Andarys to Eraldil and serves as a good example of how not to write a love letter. Detective Work[edit] You can find Andarys nearby in his General Goods shop on the same level. Although eloquent, Andarys struggles to express his feelings to Eraldil and asks you to act on his behalf. Eraldil can be found walking around the Hlaalu Canton Waistworks level, where she outright rejects Andarys' profession of love, suggesting he marry her cousin instead. Return to Andarys with the bad news; he takes it surprisingly well and suggests using a love potion to win Eraldil over. Play Cupid[edit] You can either agree to use the potion or suggest her cousin, Glathel. If you mention Glathel, Andarys will change his mind and agree that she would be a good choice. If you return to Andarys after ten days have passed, he and Glathel will be happily married, and he will reward you with a Flamemirror Robe and discounted prices at his store. Buyer Beware[edit] If you choose to use the potion, bring it to Eraldil, pretending it's an apology from Andarys. She accepts it with her usual rudeness. Return to Andarys, who remains optimistic and rewards you with a Light Ring. If you check back after ten days, they will be married, but Gadayn's mood will have soured, and he will blame you for it, raising his prices as a result."

Mebestian Ence smuggles Dwemer goods and Shadbak gra-Burbug takes bribes from Ence to overlook his activities. Once in Ence's shop you can find a Dwemer coherer in a small locked (50) chest on a shelf upstairs, or it may be purchased from him for around 60 gold. The coherer is fairly heavy (40), so a feather potion may be necessary depending on your carry weight. Confronting Shadbak gra-Burbug[edit] Shadbak gra-Burbug can be found just inside Fort Pelagiad, up the street from Mebestian's shop. Confront Shadbak about the artifact and convince her to release New-Shoes. If you stole the artifact from Mebestian, don't admit to it.

Gathering Rat Meat[edit] Again, any rat meat is acceptable and if you perform a lot of traveling, you might already have the five pieces on you. Return to Tunifus with the rat meat to receive a Potion of Cure Poison, and a copy of The Wraith's Wedding Dowry and Charwich-Koniinge, Volume 1, two Unarmored skill books."

He also provides directions to an egg mine with some scribs and teaches you the Detect Creature spell to help you hunt the animals. Gathering Scrib Jelly[edit] The Shulk Egg Mine named by Tunifus is just southwest of Balmora. You may need to kill a number of scribs to get the five units of jelly, and you can talk to one of the miners outside, Dinok, for another couple of units if you need them (if his disposition is high enough). Of course, you can also acquire scrib jelly by other means; scribs are fairly common in other locations and you can purchase their jelly from many vendors. Return to Tunifus with the scrib jelly to receive a Potion of Cure Poison, a Potion of Cure Blight Disease, and an  apprentice's alembic."

Tunifus says that he usually steals the willow anther from Gro-Bagrat Plantation, north of the Vivec Foreign Quarter. Gathering Willow Anther[edit] The willow anther can be found on the lavender-colored flowers in the box to the right of the front door (Gurak is inside, so it's relatively safe). Alternatively, you can also get the willow anther from any other source: for instance there are several willow flowers just across the bridge from Ebonheart. Return to Tunifus with the willow anther to receive a Potion of Cure Paralyzation, and a copy of The Four Suitors of Benitah (a Restoration skill book)."

Recover the 10 hides and return them to Girith. Claim your reward from Berwen, in Tel Mora.","Girith's Stolen Hides[edit] You'll find Athanden Girith west of the Ahemmusa Camp along a path and discover that he has been robbed by two Ashlanders. Girith tells you that his friend Berwen in Tel Mora will reward you greatly if you can recover his guar hides for him. Track down the culprits[edit] Head to the Ahemmusa Camp and ask around about the attack. You will be told that the thieves are two outcast Ashlanders, Emul-Ran and Kashtes Ilabael, who can be found in a camp to the south by the water's edge along with a pack guar. When asked, the pair will readily admit to the theft and attack, so feel free to dispose of them at your pleasure. Be sure to take the 10 Girith's Guar Hide from Emul-Ran's body (note that ordinary guar hides will not do). Return the hides to Girith, who will thank you. Choosing to spare one or both of the thieves by opting to pickpocket the hides will not alter the final outcome in terms of quest rewards, although Girith does express his disappointment if either remain alive. Claim your reward[edit] To receive your reward, trek over to Berwen's shop in Tel Mora. She will thank you profusely for recovering the guar hides and reward you with three Fortify Health Potions and a Ring of Hornhand."

Cure the Kwama Queen. Return to Darius in Gnisis and report your findings.","General Darius at Madach Tradehouse in Gnisis will ask you to cure the blighted Kwama Queen in the Gnisis Eggmine, located on the hill on the east side of town. You'll need a Cure Blight Disease on Touch/Target spell or a similar scroll (check with Hetman Abelmawia in town, though they are expensive) or you could also get the spell Vivec's Touch from the Shrine of Justice in town. Vivec's Touch is a spell that will cure any common or blight disease on touch. To learn the spell, you must go to the Tribunal Temple in Gnisis. The relic Vivec's Ashmask is there, but the one on display is a fake. You must go up to the Shrine of Justice and pay tribute once, which will cure any common or blight diseases you may have, and then pay tribute again, which will open a hidden compartment in the shrine to reveal the authentic Vivec's Ashmask. Paying tribute requires a donation of a Cure Common Disease potion each time. These can be bought from the alchemist in the temple. Touch the Ashmask to be taught the spell Vivec's Touch. After procuring your preferred method of curing the Kwama Queen, just head up to the Eggmine. Follow the main tunnel to the Lower Eggmine. Be careful, as the Kwama Queen is guarded by several Kwama Warriors. Return to Darius when the Queen is cured to collect 100 gold."

She's an outlaw, so there's no need to worry about getting a bounty - just attack her right away. She is equipped with an iron war axe and a few pieces of netch leather armor.

Go to Red Mountain via the Ghostgate and donate a soul gem to the Shrine of Pride. Return to any Master of the Tribunal Temple.","Pilgrimages of the Seven Graces[edit] Any of the Tribunal Temple quest givers will give you this quest just after you join. In order to receive any more quests from the Temple, you must first perform the Pilgrimages of the Seven Graces, visiting seven shrines across the island. Though none of the quests are particularly difficult, a good deal of traveling throughout the western portion of the map is required. You must visit and activate each shrine, which require you to provide a certain item for each one. You should be given the book The Pilgrim's Path which has a rather thorough description of each shrine. The shrines can be visited in any order and their approximate location should be marked on your map. Grace of Humility, Fields of Kummu[edit] The Shrine of Humility can be found in the Fields of Kummu, on the north shore of Lake Amaya along the road between two trees. You need a portion of muck to activate this shrine (just north of the marker on your map). If you don't have muck, proceed south into the lake until you come across a small island where you can obtain some from a Muckspunge. Once you activate the shrine, you will be blessed with Feather 100 pts for 48 min. The Shrine to Stop the Moon (Grace of Daring) Grace of Daring, Vivec Temple[edit] The Shrine of Daring, a.k.a. the Shrine to Stop the Moon, is one of three shrines in Vivec, found outside in the southwest corner of the Temple Canton. To activate the shrine, you will need a Rising Force Potion, which can be bought from Danso Indules in the Temple tunnel or from other vendors around Vivec (any quality of potion will do, though you cannot use one you made yourself). Once you activate the shrine, you will be blessed with Levitate 100 pts for 24 min. You can receive this high-speed, long-lasting levitation again and again by returning to donate another potion; this is useful for map exploration and semi-fast travel, e.g. to Daedric and Dwemer sites in the Ascadian Isles. Grace of Generosity, Palace of Vivec[edit] The Shrine of Generosity is one of three shrines in Vivec, found outside the entrance to the Palace. With a donation of 100 gold you can activate the shrine and be blessed with Fortify Mercantile and Luck 10 pts for 48 min. Grace of Courtesy, The Puzzle Canal[edit] The Shrine of Courtesy is one of the three shrines in Vivec and its entrance can be found on Level 3 of the Puzzle Canal in the Palace Canton (in the center of the level in the tunnel). Once inside you will find a shrine that will only give you the cryptic message of Breathe the Waters of His Glory and the Way is Made Clear. To ""breathe the waters"", you must stay underwater until your Breath Bar is depleted, at which point your health will begin to decrease; when your health drops below 10, you will black out for a second and be healed (If you are unable to drown because you have a permanent Water Breathing effect, damage your health to 10 while underwater, or unequip the item providing the effect). Once healed, resurface and head back up the steps and you will find there is now a bridge to a new part of the room. Cross the bridge to the revealed area and talk to the Dremora Krazzt at the top of the stairs beside the shrine. You MUST take a silver long sword out of the chest beside him. That delivers a message about ""you having given"" a sword to the daedra. After that, you MUST talk to the daedra about that sword you TOOK a moment before from the chest. ONLY THEN you get a dialog option with the daedra. Give him the Silver Longsword via the dialog option. You can now activate the shrine and be blessed with Water Breathing and Swift Swim 25 pts for 48 min. The Ash Mask inside the Temple Grace of Justice, Gnisis[edit] The Shrine of Justice, a.k.a. the Shrine of the Mask, can be found at the top of the Tribunal Temple in Gnisis, next to the Mask of Vivec artifact. You need a Potion of Cure Common Disease to activate the shrine, which can be bought within the Temple (check the rooms near the entrance). Once you activate the shrine, try touching the middle panel again to reveal the true Vivec Ashmask. Touch the mask to be taught the spell Vivec's Touch (cheap but 100% effective Cure Common and Blight Disease on Touch). If you are born under the atronach birthsign, touching the true Vivec Ashmask can be an infinite, though tedious, source of magicka. Grace of Valor, Koal Cave[edit] The Shrine of Valor is a little more difficult to reach, being found inside the Koal Cave just south of Gnisis along the shore (it is marked on your map, under the stone arch). You will need some Dreugh Wax to activate the shrine just inside the entrance. You can buy wax in the Gnisis Temple, or just find and kill the Dreugh Warlord found further inside the cave (the Warlord might be very tough for lower level characters). Activate the shrine to receive the blessing of Fortify Unarmored, Light Armor, Medium Armor, Heavy Armor 10 pts for 48 min. If you have killed the Dreugh Warlord in the cave, you'll also receive an enchanted Dreugh Cuirass. The shrine inside the Ghostfence Grace of Pride, Ghostfence[edit] The Shrine of Pride is the most difficult shrine to visit, mainly due to its remote location. You might want to pick up a Petty Soul Gem before you head out since you need a soul gem to activate the shrine. Any type of soul gem, filled or not, will be acceptable. Head towards the Ghostgate, which should be marked on your map, by traveling roughly southeast of Ald'ruhn or taking a long walk northwards through Foyada Mamaea. Once you reach the Ghostgate, look for the pillars with switches on their sides. You will need to activate two switches to be able to pass northwards through the tunnel. Once inside the Ghostfence, travel north a few paces and then follow the path northeast. You will find the shrine at the end, in the little dip between two trees. Activate the shrine with a soul gem to receive a blessing of Fortify Magicka 50 pts and Shield 25 pts for 48 min. One note of warning: The shrine here will take one of each type of soul gem you have, which might be distressing if you were saving them for your next visit to an enchanter. However, you can prevent this happening by dropping all but the cheapest gem before activating the shrine.  It will not, thankfully, take Azura's Star. Also, in the temple accessed from the two Ghostgate towers, you will find numerous shrines that provide various stat buffs, if you are low-level and uneasy about going inside the Ghostfence, where you may encounter Ash and Corprus Creatures, even not far inside the gate. Completion[edit] Once you visit and activate all seven shrines, return to any Tribunal Temple Master (not necessarily the quest givers) to notify them that you've finished the pilgrimages, selecting the ""Seven Graces"" conversation topic."

In order to receive any more quests from the Temple, you must first perform the Pilgrimages of the Seven Graces, visiting seven shrines across the island. Though none of the quests are particularly difficult, a good deal of traveling throughout the western portion of the map is required. You must visit and activate each shrine, which require you to provide a certain item for each one. You should be given the book The Pilgrim's Path which has a rather thorough description of each shrine. The shrines can be visited in any order and their approximate location should be marked on your map. Grace of Humility, Fields of Kummu[edit] The Shrine of Humility can be found in the Fields of Kummu, on the north shore of Lake Amaya along the road between two trees. You need a portion of muck to activate this shrine (just north of the marker on your map). If you don't have muck, proceed south into the lake until you come across a small island where you can obtain some from a Muckspunge. Once you activate the shrine, you will be blessed with Feather 100 pts for 48 min. The Shrine to Stop the Moon (Grace of Daring) Grace of Daring, Vivec Temple[edit] The Shrine of Daring, a.k.a. the Shrine to Stop the Moon, is one of three shrines in Vivec, found outside in the southwest corner of the Temple Canton. To activate the shrine, you will need a Rising Force Potion, which can be bought from Danso Indules in the Temple tunnel or from other vendors around Vivec (any quality of potion will do, though you cannot use one you made yourself). Once you activate the shrine, you will be blessed with Levitate 100 pts for 24 min. You can receive this high-speed, long-lasting levitation again and again by returning to donate another potion; this is useful for map exploration and semi-fast travel, e.g. to Daedric and Dwemer sites in the Ascadian Isles. Grace of Generosity, Palace of Vivec[edit] The Shrine of Generosity is one of three shrines in Vivec, found outside the entrance to the Palace. With a donation of 100 gold you can activate the shrine and be blessed with Fortify Mercantile and Luck 10 pts for 48 min. Grace of Courtesy, The Puzzle Canal[edit] The Shrine of Courtesy is one of the three shrines in Vivec and its entrance can be found on Level 3 of the Puzzle Canal in the Palace Canton (in the center of the level in the tunnel). Once inside you will find a shrine that will only give you the cryptic message of Breathe the Waters of His Glory and the Way is Made Clear. To ""breathe the waters"", you must stay underwater until your Breath Bar is depleted, at which point your health will begin to decrease; when your health drops below 10, you will black out for a second and be healed (If you are unable to drown because you have a permanent Water Breathing effect, damage your health to 10 while underwater, or unequip the item providing the effect). Once healed, resurface and head back up the steps and you will find there is now a bridge to a new part of the room. Cross the bridge to the revealed area and talk to the Dremora Krazzt at the top of the stairs beside the shrine. You MUST take a silver long sword out of the chest beside him. That delivers a message about ""you having given"" a sword to the daedra. After that, you MUST talk to the daedra about that sword you TOOK a moment before from the chest. ONLY THEN you get a dialog option with the daedra. Give him the Silver Longsword via the dialog option. You can now activate the shrine and be blessed with Water Breathing and Swift Swim 25 pts for 48 min. The Ash Mask inside the Temple Grace of Justice, Gnisis[edit] The Shrine of Justice, a.k.a. the Shrine of the Mask, can be found at the top of the Tribunal Temple in Gnisis, next to the Mask of Vivec artifact. You need a Potion of Cure Common Disease to activate the shrine, which can be bought within the Temple (check the rooms near the entrance). Once you activate the shrine, try touching the middle panel again to reveal the true Vivec Ashmask. Touch the mask to be taught the spell Vivec's Touch (cheap but 100% effective Cure Common and Blight Disease on Touch). If you are born under the atronach birthsign, touching the true Vivec Ashmask can be an infinite, though tedious, source of magicka. Grace of Valor, Koal Cave[edit] The Shrine of Valor is a little more difficult to reach, being found inside the Koal Cave just south of Gnisis along the shore (it is marked on your map, under the stone arch). You will need some Dreugh Wax to activate the shrine just inside the entrance. You can buy wax in the Gnisis Temple, or just find and kill the Dreugh Warlord found further inside the cave (the Warlord might be very tough for lower level characters). Activate the shrine to receive the blessing of Fortify Unarmored, Light Armor, Medium Armor, Heavy Armor 10 pts for 48 min. If you have killed the Dreugh Warlord in the cave, you'll also receive an enchanted Dreugh Cuirass. The shrine inside the Ghostfence Grace of Pride, Ghostfence[edit] The Shrine of Pride is the most difficult shrine to visit, mainly due to its remote location. You might want to pick up a Petty Soul Gem before you head out since you need a soul gem to activate the shrine. Any type of soul gem, filled or not, will be acceptable. Head towards the Ghostgate, which should be marked on your map, by traveling roughly southeast of Ald'ruhn or taking a long walk northwards through Foyada Mamaea. Once you reach the Ghostgate, look for the pillars with switches on their sides. You will need to activate two switches to be able to pass northwards through the tunnel. Once inside the Ghostfence, travel north a few paces and then follow the path northeast. You will find the shrine at the end, in the little dip between two trees. Activate the shrine with a soul gem to receive a blessing of Fortify Magicka 50 pts and Shield 25 pts for 48 min. One note of warning: The shrine here will take one of each type of soul gem you have, which might be distressing if you were saving them for your next visit to an enchanter. However, you can prevent this happening by dropping all but the cheapest gem before activating the shrine.  It will not, thankfully, take Azura's Star. Also, in the temple accessed from the two Ghostgate towers, you will find numerous shrines that provide various stat buffs, if you are low-level and uneasy about going inside the Ghostfence, where you may encounter Ash and Corprus Creatures, even not far inside the gate. Completion[edit] Once you visit and activate all seven shrines, return to any Tribunal Temple Master (not necessarily the quest givers) to notify them that you've finished the pilgrimages, selecting the ""Seven Graces"" conversation topic."

Grandmaster[edit] Traditionally, the Morag Tong Grandmaster is chosen when the old one is executed, but you are given the option to let Eno go gracefully. You can do either. The easiest is to simply agree with Eno, in which case you become Grandmaster merely by your choice of dialogue options. Otherwise, you can kill Eno anytime after you reach the rank of Master to become the new Grandmaster. If you want to get the Sanguine items back, or to acquire the unique, unenchanted black gloves, you will need to kill him instead of letting him retire. Once you let him retire he will disappear, never to be seen again. The items go with him."

Unfortunately, the retort is on the shelf in front of Berwen, so you'll have to be sneaky. The easiest way is to go upstairs, jump over the boxes, jump up on the table in the far corner, take one or two steps into the corner, turn to the right until you can see the shelf below, get into sneak mode and use a telekinesis spell (one with a 25 foot range works well) to grab the retort. Another way is to exploit the game mechanics by jumping onto the shelf, then immediately jump again so you are stuck in the ceiling (you have perfect sneak when you are in the ceiling), then sneak and grab the retort and anything else within your reach that you may want. If you have already killed the Corprus Stalker upstairs, you could just buy it for an exorbitant amount of money if you don't want to risk getting caught, but it's cheaper to kill Berwen (you'll get a bounty around 40), take the retort and anything else that seems useful to you, then go remove the price on your head with Rissinia when you return to Sadrith Mora. Speak with Big Helende to finish the quest."

Nileno's trying to improve House Hlaalu's share of the guar hide trade with the alchemists in Vivec. Locate Rolasa Oren[edit] Travel to Vivec; the quickest options from Balmora are either the Mages Guild Guide or via Silt Strider. The Guild Guide will place you in the Foreign Quarter, where you'll find Rolasa Oren. Ask around, and you'll find out that Rolasa works out of the Upper Waistworks in the Foreign Quarter, where she has a vendor's stall. Rolasa Needs Some Convincing[edit] Asking about her in Vivec will lead the locals to direct you to her depending on your location. Rolasa Oren [People in the Foreign Canton's Upper Waistworks]: ""Her shop is right over there."" [People in the Foreign Canton elsewhere]: ""She has a small stall in the Upper Waistworks along with a few other merchants."" Initially Rolasa will refuse your request, stating that imported guar hides are not that fresh, and that she's been buying from House Redoran for years. Raise her disposition to 80 or above or successfully intimidate her and she will agree. Several methods to raise her disposition can be found here. Once Rolasa agrees, travel back to Balmora and report back to Nileno to complete the quest and receive 1000 gold, a portion of the future guar hide sales, for your efforts."

Hair Shirt of St. Aralor[edit] If you've gone far enough on the Main Quest, you actually know where Kogoruhn is. Otherwise, Kogoruhn is a large underground network of caverns in the north, and the best way to get there is to exit the Ghostgate and follow the outside perimeter of the Ghostfence until you reach the northernmost point. From there, head north until you reach the Kogoruhn stronghold, just east of Falasmaryon. The body of Feril, with the shirt, is outside, around the corner from the entrance to the Hall of Phisto.

The Haunting[edit] Once in Caldera, you should find Nedhelas wandering around on the street outside his house. He'll tell you that he thinks the ghost is in his cellar and gives you a key to his house. If you note the name of the cellar entrance, the problem should be obvious... the house was built on top of the Heleran Ancestral Tomb.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Hlaalu_Hortator","Meet with Crassius Curio in the Curio Manor, Vivec Hlaalu Plaza, to receive an overview of the Hlaalu councilors. Get Curio's vote for Hortator. Find Dram Bero hidden in the Haunted Manor, St. Olms, and get his vote. Learn about Orvas Dren from Dram Bero. Find Yngling Half-Troll in Vivec, St. Olms Plaza, Yngling Manor, and get his vote (gold required). Deal with Orvas Dren at Dren Plantation, north of Vivec. Find Velanda Omani in Omani Manor on Elmas Island, east of the St. Olms Canton, and get her vote. Find Nevena Ules in Ules Manor, just west of Suran (east of the Dren Plantation, and northeast of Vivec) and get her vote. Return to Curio to be named the Hortator of House Hlaalu.","Overview[edit] This quest is part of convincing each of the three Great Houses to name you their Hortator. The exact order you approach the houses in is not important. Again, you must visit all the council members of the House to convince them to vote for you. If you don't already have one, Nileno Dorvayn will supply you with a copy of the Yellow Book of 3E 426 which lists all the members, and for 50 drakes she will direct you to Crassius Curio. The members are: Crassius Curio, Yngling Half-Troll, Dram Bero, Nevena Ules, and Velanda Omani. Note that unlike the other two Great Houses, being the Grandmaster of House Hlaalu does not enable you to skip these steps. Crassius Curio[edit] Crassius Curio, downstairs in the Curio Manor in Vivec, Hlaalu Plaza, will support you for a little favor. If he likes you (70 disposition), he just wants a kiss. Otherwise, it's 500 gold for Hlaalu members, 1000 for non-members. Curio also has some good advice on the other council members. You get a +30 disposition increase if you kiss him, +10 if you give him the gold. Another option is to bribe him with 1000 gold (which will increase his disposition to 100) or a few 100s and then kiss him, bringing the price down and making him like you more. Dram Bero[edit] Dram Bero is hidden in the basement of the Haunted Manor in St. Olms Plaza. The basement door is locked (there are lockpicks under a table in the first room). You merely have to talk to him to get his vote. He'll mention that Velanda and Nevena are loyal to Orvas Dren, the brother of the Duke who has a large plantation in the Ascadian Isles (see below). Yngling Half-Troll[edit] Yngling Half-Troll is in Vivec, St. Olms Canton Plaza, Yngling Manor. He'll ask for 1000 gold if you're a member, or 2000 otherwise. An alternate route is to actually kill Yngling, which is quite alright with the other council members if you talk to them about it (such as Dram Bero). But beware; if you attack Yngling, everyone else in his house may come to his aid and help to finish you off. A good opportunity to kill him will provide itself during the Yngling's Ledger quest - refusing to give him the ledger will provoke an attack. Orvas Dren[edit] In order to convince Velanda and Nevena, you must take care of Orvas Dren first, which may mean a number of things. You can just kill him, but he is well armed and has a few good bodyguards. You can blackmail him if you obtain some papers from a locked (75) small chest in his basement (the two doors to which are locked (60) and trapped; his bodyguard carries a key, and another one lies on a desk next to the stairs directly below Dren himself). Or, if you can raise his disposition high enough, you can talk to him about protecting Morrowind from the Empire, resulting in Dren giving you his vote for Hortator. If you're in House Hlaalu and you've done the quest to take over the Camonna Tong, Dren should just give it up and say he'll use his influence on his two puppet councilors.  Of course, if you completed that quest by killing him and breaking the link between Hlaalu and the Camonnas, rather than taking them over, there won't be a problem... Orvas lives on the Dren Plantation, a large manor north of Vivec. If your disposition is low when talking to him, he may attack; kill him quickly to avoid alerting the guards. There appears to be no way to show Dren's incriminating note to his brother, Duke Vedam Dren. Velanda Omani and Nevena Ules[edit] Once Orvas is taken care of, you can continue and talk to Velanda and Nevena. Velanda is in Omani Manor on Elmas Island, east of the Vivec St. Olms Canton. Nevena is in Ules Manor, across the bay directly west of Suran's House of Earthly Delights (directly east of the Dren Plantation, and northeast of Vivec). The manor is surrounded by slaves (there is no key to free them). Once you talk to each of the two councilors about the Hlaalu Hortator, they hastily give you their vote. Return to Curio[edit] You can now return to Curio in Vivec to be officially named as House Hlaalu's Hortator and receive the Belt of the Hortator as proof."

Overview of the Fourth and Fifth Trials[edit] By now you should have either completed the Fourth and Fifth Trials (being named Hortator by the three Great Houses and Nerevarine by the four Ashlander Tribes), or bypassed them (by being at least level 20 and having 50 or more reputation). You will be told that you should meet with the Archcanon in Vivec High Fane, so head there now. Finding the Archcanon[edit] Meet with Danso Indules in the Temple Canton of Vivec, in the central exterior tunnel. Danso says that Archcanon Saryoni is waiting for you in his private quarters in the East Chapel of the High Fane. Once you enter the High Fane, you quickly discover that the Archcanon is actually behind a locked (45) door. Unfortunately there's an Ordinator standing nearby which means that none but the most stealthy of characters may wish to try it. There is a back door from the Hall of Wisdom and, although the door is still locked (50), there's no Ordinator on watch. To reach this back door, go down to the lower level outside, the Hall of Justice on the west, the Hall of Wisdom on the east. Enter the Hall of Wisdom from the south side and turn left at the second corridor. A few steps and you come to a four way intersection, a doorway to the Hall of Justice in front of you, stairs to either side and a short corridor to the left. Turn left along this corridor and go up the stairs, coming to the locked back door. Talking with the Archcanon[edit] Once inside the Archcanon's office, you can talk with Tholer Saryoni. Choose ""Temple's doctrine,"" and after a brief talk, you are given the choice to visit the god Vivec, who will hopefully shed some more light on the current situation. When you say yes, you are given two keys: for the Archcanon's office and the Palace of Vivec. You are warned that the Ordinators are still not under Tholer's control. Meet with Vivec[edit] The Palace of Vivec can be found at the top of the puzzle canal, south of the Temple Canton. You can find Vivec just inside the entrance. Vivec goes over the plan for you to follow in the future (assuming you accept all the items and oaths). You receive the Wraithguard, a powerful right gauntlet needed to defeat Dagoth Ur. Vivec gives you his blessing and says that he will end the persecution of the Dissident Priests and the Nerevarine by the Tribunal Temple (After which the Temple ends its hostility and you can join the Temple or complete any open Temple quests). You receive detailed plans on exactly how to go about defeating Dagoth Ur. Plan to Defeat Dagoth Ur[edit] The plan involves five basic steps: A series of aggressive raids within the Ghostfence. A series of aggressive raids to neutralize Dagoth Ur's ash vampire kin and recover artifacts from the bodies of said kin. An assault of Gate Citadel Vemynal to neutralize Dagoth Vemyn and recover the artifact hammer Sunder. An assault of Gate Citadel Odrosal, to neutralize Dagoth Odros and recover the artifact blade Keening. An assault of Citadel Dagoth Ur with the artifacts Wraithguard, Sunder, and Keening to sever Dagoth Ur's connection to the Heart of Lorkhan and thus to destroy Dagoth Ur.

If traveling by foot, leave through the south entrance of Ald'ruhn, head west, and follow the signs northwest to Maar Gan. When you arrive, ask around town and you'll be informed that Huleen's hut is southeast, outside of town near the temple, just east from the silt strider.

Addhiranirr Informant Meet with Addhiranirr in the Underworks of the St. Olms Canton. Find and tell the excise agent Duvianus Platorius that Addhiranirr has left for the mainland. Receive the information from Addhiranirr. Meet Mehra Milo Meet with Mehra Milo at the Library of Vivec in the Temple Canton. Steal or buy the book Progress of Truth. Return to Caius in Balmora.","Huleeya Addhiranirr Mehra Milo Orders from Caius[edit] After the last errand, Caius tells you to train for a while and come back to him later. Specifically, your character needs to be at least level 3 before Caius will give you the next assignment. At that point, he sends you on a fact-finding mission to the city of Vivec. Your mission is to track down and rendezvous with three people: Addhiranirr, a Khajiit Thieves Guild member in St. Olms, Huleeya, an Argonian Morag Tong assassin at the Black Shalk Cornerclub in the Foreign Quarter, and Mehra Milo, a Tribunal Temple priestess in the Hall of Wisdom of the Temple Canton. Caius is once again looking for any Sixth House or Nerevarine Cult information and he gives you 200 gold for expenses. The quickest way is to take the Silt Strider or the Mages Guild Guide, but feel free to take the scenic route. Huleeya Informant[edit] Huleeya is in the Black Shalk Cornerclub, in the Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks. He should be easy to find, as he is the only Argonian in the room. Unfortunately, Huleeya seems to be having trouble with the locals, who will not let him pass. Talk with the Dark Elf, Ethys Savil, or one of his two friends, and persuade him to leave the Argonian alone. Raising his disposition a bit will work, but so will homicide. If you try to leave with Huleeya without talking to one of the thugs, they will attack and you will have to protect Huleeya. Attacking the thugs first will result in Huleeya refusing to talk to you. Once you've solved this, you may escort Huleeya unhindered to Jobasha's Rare Books. Jobasha's bookshop is on the same level as the cornerclub, in the Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks, just on the opposite side. Once you're inside the bookshop with Huleeya, you will receive one Reputation point for your help and he will give you some notes to take to Caius. Also while at the bookshop, pick up the book Progress of Truth on the second floor far left bookcase as you will be needing it later in this quest. You can steal it when the Ordinator patrols elsewhere, or just buy it. Addhiranirr Informant[edit] Addhiranirr is the next closest contact in the St. Olms Canton, southeast of the Foreign Quarter (past the Redoran and next to the St. Delyn cantons). It turns out Addhiranirr is difficult to find as almost no one in St. Olms knows where she is. With enough exploration and questions, you do eventually find her all alone in the northeast Underworks, hiding from a Census and Excise agent. In order to get anything out of her, the agent must be taken care of. The agent in question is Duvianus Platorius, who can be found in St. Olms Waistworks. As usual, you can either kill him or persuade him that Addhiranirr has fled. Note that if you happen to accidentally tell him where Addhiranirr is, you can still get the information Caius wants by raising Addhiranirr's disposition until she will talk to you. Also, if you tell Duvianus Platorius where Addhiranirr is and come back later to talk about the topic 'Addhiranirr', he will give you the response normally given if you had chosen to lie to him. Anyway, once the agent is out of the way, Addhiranirr will let you know that the Sixth House is into smuggling, but no one knows what due to intense secrecy. Meet Mehra Milo[edit] The last of the contacts is Mehra Milo. She may be found in the Library of Vivec, located in the Hall of Wisdom in the Temple Canton at the southern end of Vivec. Once you find her and follow her to the back of the library, she will tell you what she knows about the Nerevarine cult. She'll also suggest that you obtain a copy of the book Progress of Truth for Caius. Although the library has a copy of the book, it is under guard, so she suggests trying the local bookshops, even though the book is officially banned by the Tribunal Temple. The copy in the library is the tall book on top of the bookshelf in the southwest corner. Alternatively, you can just buy a copy from Jobasha's Rare Books in the Lower Waistworks of the Foreign Quarter for 150 gold. Other copies can be found at: Tel Uvirith, Arelas' House Vivec, Hall of Justice Secret Library Vivec, Telvanni Tower Return to Caius[edit] Return the information to Caius, who will promote you to Journeyman and suggest you take more time to train and do some other guild work to keep your cover up.

In exchange for your silence, she'll offer to teach you one of two necromantic conjuration spells—Summon Ancestral Ghost and Summon Skeletal Minion."

She will also ask you to recover yet another artifact, the Ice Blade of the Monarch. Ice Blade of the Monarch[edit] Rotheran is on the island of Sheogorad, south of Dagon Fel.

He also has Adusamsi's Ring. Free Adusamsi Assurnarairan[edit] There are a number of slaves in the arena, including Adusamsi Assurnarairan. She will ask you to recover her ring from Llaren Terano. If you have it in your possession, she immediately takes it and teleports away. Return to Lalatia Varian once you have freed Assurnarairan to get Adusamsi's Ring as a reward.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ienas_Sarandas_(quest)","Talk to any of the named merchants about work. Convince Ienas Sarandas of the errors of his path. Return the items to the merchants. Evil Path is to keep the items or kill him.","Ienas Sarandas has lost more than money[edit] In Ald'ruhn, ask around and you will learn that Ienas Sarandas has lost his patrimony betting on guar and has sold his family silverware to pay his debts. Go to any of the merchants and they will offer you work. It seems that Ienas Sarandas has failed to pay up for the goods he has purchased. Guiding him back to the right path[edit] Look for Ienas Sarandas in his house. Ask him about the overdue payments. Don't bother threatening him, as it does no good. There are three ways to convince Ienas to do the right thing and give you the goods to return on his behalf. You can persuade him if you have a Speechcraft skill of at least 50, or you can raise his Disposition toward you to at least 60. Alternatively, you can quote an excerpt from the book Saryoni's Sermons if you have a copy in your inventory or offer him a sip of Greef, Cyrodiilic Brandy, or Flin to convince him to mend his ways (he will not take the book or the drinks from you; you just have to be carrying one of them). There's a copy of Saryoni's Sermons on a small round table in his house he won't mind you taking. Using any of these techniques results in him giving you the items and joining the Temple, and earns you 1 Reputation along with 30 disposition. In some versions of the game, the drink may not give the reputation point. Sarandas will move to the Ald'ruhn Temple as soon as you leave his house. It is also possible to kill Ienas to complete the quest, but you'll miss out on the reputation point and the merchants won't be happy with you. Bad Path[edit] Another option is to get the Ienas Sarandas conversation topic from one of the merchants, talk to Sarandas, get him to give you his clothing (using one of the above methods), and keep it for yourself. The Brocade Shirt and Silk Pants both have the enchant values of their exquisite counterparts, while the Racer Suede Belt, Glass Ring, Ebony Ring and Firejade Amulet have the enchant values of their expensive counterparts. You can also just kill him for the items, but note that if you do so, you can still complete the quest but your disposition with the locals may actually decrease. The Merchants[edit] The merchants are quite easy to find, three of them are right outside Ienas' house. The enchanter and the fine clothier are located in the Ald'ruhn Manor District on the bottom floor. The merchants also give you some gold and better prices, along with praise for your skilful solution. If you have killed Ienas however, they will still give you the gold but lower their disposition."

Mastrius will ask you to bring him the artifact shield Spell Breaker, and a Daedra's heart. The heart can be obtained by killing Daedra or buying from an alchemy shop before you became a vampire. An Ancient Artifact[edit] Spell Breaker is more difficult to obtain, but it can be found in the Dwemer ruins of Bthuand, out in the middle of nowhere, far west of Tel Mora (northwest from the Cavern of the Incarnate). If you have a Levitate spell (or a good Jump spell), get over the fence right outside Salvel Tomb then go a short distance west to the Foyada. This short Foyada leads directly north to Bthuand, right up over the hills at the end. The shield can be found behind some stones at the inner section of the ruins.

Report back to Nileno Dorvayn to complete the quest and receive your reward.","Inanius Egg Mine[edit] Nileno Dorvayn at the Balmora council manor will ask you to help undermine rival Serjo Avon Oran by killing the Kwama Queen in the Inanius Egg Mine, in the mountains east of Suran. The quickest route to the mine is to travel to Suran via the Balmora Silt Strider, then travel by foot south out of Suran, and east around the mountain into the nearby Molag Amur region. The mine is directly southeast of Suran and due south of Saturan, nestled in a small cove. Chat with Avon Oran[edit] You can optionally use this to extort up to 1000 gold from Oran (in his manor in Suran). Once in Suran, stop in at Oran Manor, located on the south side of Suran next to the Tribunal Temple, and have a chat with Avon Oran about the Inanius egg mine. He will offer you 1000 gold to leave the mine alone. You can choose to accept his offer (and earn a 5-point faction increase as well) and travel back to Balmora, but Nileno will be unhappy with your decision, and you will suffer a 10 drop in disposition with her. You can refuse his offer and suffer a drop in disposition with Oran, but be rewarded with 500 gold and a 5-point faction increase from Nileno. Or you can accept his offer, and kill the Kwama queen anyway. Nileno will also pay you for completing the quest, and will praise your devious mental workings. Killing the Kwama Queen[edit] Once at the mine (see directions above), you'll find the mine devoid of any miners; however, it is partially flooded and a swim is required to locate the queen. Dispose of her, taking out any hostile Kwama workers in the process. Completing the Quest[edit] Whichever route you choose, report back to Nileno Dorvayn in Balmora to complete the quest. If you kill the queen, you always receive five points of House Hlaalu faction reputation and Dorvayn's disposition increases by ten. Your general reputation will also increase by a point. If you promise Oran to spare the queen, his disposition increases by 20, Dorvayn's drops by 15, and you gain five points of Hlaalu reputation. Your general reputation will increase by a point as well. If you kill the queen after promising not to, Oran's disposition drops by 30, otherwise it drops by 20."

The Father[edit] You can speak with his father first, inside the shop. At first he'll be too busy to offer any help to his son, but will give you 75 gold for your assistance.

Return to the Dagoth Ur Facility Caverns to meet Azura, view a cut scene, and receive a reward.","Vivec outlined a five-step plan to eliminate Dagoth Ur: Raids inside the Ghostfence, Raids upon Ash Vampire Citadels, Assault on Gate Citadel Vemynal, Assault on Gate Citadel Odrosal, and Assault on Citadel Dagoth. Phase 1: Raids inside the Ghostfence[edit] Enter either tower at the Ghostgate and ask a Buoyant Armiger for a Map of Red Mountain using the topic ""inside the Ghostfence"" (must be a Buoyant Armiger and not an Ordinator). Scout the Red Mountain region inside the Ghostfence to become familiar with the area's locations and monsters. Phase 2: Raids upon Ash Vampire Citadels[edit] This phase is optional. However, the following artifacts can be obtained by defeating the seven Ash Vampires: Belt of Heartfire, Amulet of Heartthrum, Amulet of Heartrime, Amulet of Heartheal, Amulet of Heartfire, Soul Ring, and Blood Ring. The artifacts are not required to beat Dagoth Ur, but can be of great use against his magic attacks. Ruins of Kogoruhn[edit] Kogoruhn, one of the Ash Vampire Citadels Main article: Kogoruhn The weakest Ash Vampire, Dagoth Uthol, is in Kogoruhn. Other than the main entrance to the ruins, there is also a doorway inside the northwest area of the Ghostfence. Dagoth Uthol can be found in the Charma's Breath area, and holds the Belt of Heartfire. If Dagoth Uthol was previously defeated during The Path of the Incarnate quest, then the journal stage will not be recorded. Citadel Vemynal[edit] See the Dagoth Vemyn and the Sunder Artifact section. Citadel Endusal[edit] Main article: Endusal Dagoth Endus is in Endusal, located to the northwest of the Ghostgate. He holds the Amulet of Heartrime. Citadel Odrosal[edit] Odrosal See the Dagoth Odros and the Keening Artifact section. Citadel Tureynulal[edit] Main article: Tureynulal Dagoth Tureynul is in Tureynulal, located to the northeast of Dagoth Ur. He can be found in Kagrenac's Library, and holds the Amulet of Heartthrum. If Dagoth Tureynul was previously defeated during the Tribunal Temple quest Cleaver of St. Felms, then the journal stage will not be recorded. Citadel Dagoth[edit] See the Dagoth Gilvoth section. Mamaea[edit] Main article: Mamaea Dagoth Araynys is in Mamaea, located to the southeast of Gnisis. He can be found in the Sanctum of Black Hope, and holds the Soul Ring. There is also some unique loot in the Shrine of Pitted Dreams bell chamber, including the Daedric Face of Inspiration and the Fang of Haynekhtnamet. Phase 3: Assault on Gate Citadel Vemynal[edit] Vemynal is located to the northwest of Dagoth Ur. Vivec marks the location of this citadel on the map after talking to him about the plan to defeat Dagoth Ur. Dagoth Vemyn and the Sunder Artifact[edit] Sunder Dagoth Vemyn can be found in the Hall of Torque (lower level), and holds the Amulet of Heartheal and Sunder artifacts. Phase 4: Assault on Gate Citadel Odrosal[edit] Odrosal is located to the southeast of Dagoth Ur. Vivec marks the location of this citadel on the map after talking to him about the plan to defeat Dagoth Ur. Dagoth Odros and the Keening Artifact[edit] Keening Dagoth Odros can be found in the Dwemer Training Academy (Level 2), and holds the Amulet of Heartfire and Dagoth Odros's Key. The Keening artifact can be found in the Tower area of Odrosal. The door to the Tower can be unlocked with Dagoth Odros's Key. Phase 5: Assault on Citadel Dagoth[edit] Dagoth Ur Citadel The Dagoth Ur Facility is located in the center of Red Mountain. Before assaulting the facility, three Dwemer artifacts are required: Wraithguard (gauntlet received from Vivec), Sunder (warhammer obtained in Citadel Vemynal), and Keening (short blade obtained in Citadel Odrosal). The easiest path to the citadel is to the southeast, and runs between Odrosal and the Yanemus Mine. The Outer Facilities entrance is blocked by a spherical door that can be opened with a hand crank found on a pipe to the south of the entrance. Dagoth Gilvoth[edit] Dagoth Gilvoth can be found in the Lower Facility of Dagoth Ur, and holds the Blood Ring. Dagoth Ur[edit] Dagoth Ur can be found in the Facility Cavern. He will not be hostile at first, and says it is up to you to make the first blow (although he may still attack first after a short period of time). Talk with him for a bit to gain some information, then attack when ready. There's no secret tactic to killing him the first time; just hit/cast hard and he should fall shortly. He will eventually disappear, leaving the Heart Ring near the entrance to Akulakhan's Chamber. Akulakhan[edit] The Heart of Lorkhan Once you enter Akulakhan's Chamber, you cannot leave by any means until the Heart of Lorkhan is destroyed, so make sure you are prepared. Heal up and equip Wraithguard, then Sunder. Dagoth Ur and his minions will attack immediately after entering the chamber. Dagoth Ur is effectively invincible at this stage, so you should ignore him and focus on reaching the Heart, which is found in the center of the great Dwemer golem, Akulakhan. It is possible to get Dagoth Ur out of the way temporarily by luring him off the cliff into the lava with Levitate. It's best to use Levitate or Slowfall to reach Akulakhan. Be aware that Dagoth Ur will teleport onto the bridge the first time you approach the heart. Strike the Heart of Lorkhan once with Sunder, then five times with Keening to destroy it. As soon at the Heart is destroyed, Akulakhan begins to collapse, so quickly run back across the bridge or get away by other means or you may be sent plummeting into the lava below. Dagoth Ur is now mortal, although you do not need to kill him yourself and he may fall into the lava and die as Akulakhan collapses on top of him. In any case, the destruction of Akulakhan ends his reign of terror. Azura's Reward[edit] Dagoth Ur after the blight Destroying the Heart unseals the door through which you entered the chamber, which can be re-opened by a crank on the pipes in front of it. Follow the ledge back around to the top (or fly up) and open the door. As you leave the cavern where you first met Dagoth Ur, Azura will appear before you and a cutscene will begin, outlining your accomplishments and revealing that with Dagoth Ur's death the blight plaguing the land is gone. She will leave the Ring of Azura on the ground, which will disappear after leaving the area. When the ring is picked up, a misnamed spell called Hand of Dagoth (with ID hand of azura) will be cast on you. This spell is a 100 pts Restore Attributes spell (restores all attributes except Personality and Intelligence). There will be no more blight or ash storms, though some creatures may still be affected. Any remaining Ash Vampires will perish in their lairs, leaving behind their unique artifacts. Sleepers in towns will also wake from their nightmare. Congratulations! You have finished Morrowind's Main Quest!"

Master Neloth in Tel Naga (Sadrith Mora). Arch-Magister Gothren in the Upper Tower of Tel Aruhn. Return to Trebonius Artorius.","Duties[edit] Trebonius Artorius in the Vivec Guild of Mages will give you this quest only if you have solved the Mystery of the Dwarves and finished the Main Quest. The request is strange, but simple, requiring you to merely kill all of the Telvanni councilors (since you've done the Main Quest you should know where they all are). Members of House Telvanni should note that killing Master Aryon will prevent you from becoming Arch Magister of House Telvanni, if you have not already done so. The Telvanni Councilors[edit] The councilors, in brief, are: Master Aryon in Tel Vos (Upper Chamber) Mistress Dratha in the Upper Tower in Tel Mora Mistress Therana in the Upper Tower of Tel Branora Master Neloth in Tel Naga (Sadrith Mora) Arch-Magister Gothren in the Upper Tower of Tel Aruhn (probably already dead) Of course these are all powerful mages and many of them well guarded, so it's not an easy task, but one that you're probably up to at this point.

She complains that her ring has fallen into a nearby pond and wants you to get it. If you are playing a male character, her request is accompanied by some significant flirting as well. The Lady's Ring[edit] The ring is in a shallow pool of water just north of Jeline. Since the water is so murky and the ring is so tiny, you may have a great deal of trouble locating it. A Night Eye spell may be of use here. The ring can be found lying next to the second plant from the south edge of the pool. If you dip your head just below the water, you can see through the surface without causing your vision to become murky or starting the breath timer.

Stealing the Land Deed[edit] The Library can be found in the Halls of Wisdom in the Temple Canton in the south of Vivec.

Travel to Seyda Neen (the town where the game starts), find Indrele near her shack in the west of town and return the deed to her: forged land deed ""Just leave me alone. I already told you.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Larrius_Varro_Tells_a_Little_Story","Overhear the latest rumors or ask someone about a little secret to discover that Larrius Varro wishes to speak with you. Meet Varro in Moonmoth Legion Fort, and he suggests that you should take care of the ""Bad People"" in Balmora. Ask around the Thieves Guild about the ""Bad People"". Go to the Council Club. Kill all the ""Bad People"", and make your way back to Larrius Varro to claim your reward.","A Rumor[edit] If you ask about the latest rumors in Balmora, you might discover that the local magistrate, Nolus Atrius (a character who doesn't exist in the game), is corrupt and that Larrius Varro has sworn to stop the corruption. Alternatively, people in town might tell you a little secret, which is that Varro has been looking to have a chat with you. In either case, Varro is the Champion at Moonmoth Legion Fort (just east of town) so you should head there and talk to him. Larrius Varro[edit] Larrius is in the back of the main fort, past all the vendor tables. At first, Larrius speaks very carefully and actually asks you to do nothing (which is his intent), but if you question him further he will tell you that he wants someone to wipe out five members of the Camonna Tong in Balmora. Though he doesn't know where they are, or even their names, he knows their professions: scout, pawnbroker, savant, thief, and smith. The Bad People[edit] Return to Balmora and ask around about the Bad People and you will be directed to the Thieves Guild in the South Wall Cornerclub (disposition of 50 or higher is needed). Ask around in the club and, if you are persuasive enough, you will learn that all of the Bad People are in the Camonna Tong, and they hang out at the Council Club in town.  Their names are: Madrale Thirith, Marasa Aren, Sovor Trandel, Thanelen Velas, and Vadusa Sathryon. The barkeep, Banor Seran, is the only other person in the building. In the Council Club, you'll find 3 of the members in the tavern (you don't have to kill the Barkeep), one is downstairs, and one upstairs. Taking on all 5 at once (and sometimes the barkeep), can be very tough. You may wish to stock up on scrolls and potions beforehand. The two loners may be assassinated or taunted into fighting without alerting the others. Taunting any of the three members in the barroom, however, will likely cause the other two to attack you as well, so be prepared. A Frenzy spell may also work well. If not, moving onto the staircase or the bedroom corridor may limit those in attack range to one or two. Madrale and Marasa are somewhat hostile by default, thus easy to taunt. If you're planning to join the Thieves Guild or are already a member but haven't yet completed the Nerano Manor Key quest, make sure to get the key Sovor is carrying from his corpse before you leave. Return to Varro[edit] Unfortunately, unless you attacked them in self defense, you will become wanted by the guards. If you can make it back to Moonmoth Legion Fort without being apprehended, Varro will remove the price on your head in return for helping him out. The easiest way to get back to Varro is to use a Divine Intervention or Recall spell. Alternatively, you can use invisibility or chameleon to avoid being noticed by the guards, or simply sneak out of town, if your skill is high enough. You will receive a nice Ring of Surroundings as a reward. If you managed to kill all of the bad people without obtaining a bounty, or were able to clear your name before speaking with Varro, the captain will be happy at your discretion and give you a copy of Biography of the Wolf Queen as well. One way to remove your bounty is at the nearby South Wall Cornerclub, the hangout of the Thieves Guild in Balmora. This can be done in between killings to maintain a bounty below 5000 gold, which will prevent the bug (mentioned below) where guards will continually attack you even after Larrius Varro's absolution of the bounty. An easy escape path is to exit the Cornerclub building and cross the street to the Silt Strider and exit the town. Run East towards Moonmoth Fort, and at the fork take a left (North on the map) to run around the back of the Fort. Approaching from the Northeast, you can jump onto the wall of the Fort and run along the wall towards the central keep, where there is a trap door that leads you directly in front of Larrius Varro.  This requires at most a few seconds of invisibility while approaching the trap door and possibly none at all. The same concept can also be used to approach the South Wall Cornerclub from behind, unseen by guards, if you're looking to clear your bounty that way."

The Hall has entrances on both the Waistworks and Plaza levels; Alarvyne can be found on the upstairs level. She will complain that Dwemer items are becoming more difficult to obtain, possibly due to manipulation by Bolrin at the East Empire Company offices in Ebonheart. She knows that a shipment of Dwemer limeware can currently be found in the ship Chun-Ook at the docks at Ebonheart and asks you to steal the limeware for her.  Specifically, she wants five Limeware Cups and five Limeware Bowls. The Chun-Ook[edit] Go to the dock on the east side of Ebonheart. Nevosi Hlan, the shipmaster, stands on deck near the locked (25) trap door to the upper level of the ship's interior. There is no key, so you'll have to break in. Two guards patrol inside the upper level. They don't seem to mind if you take anything in this room, but if they see you attempt to open the locked (30) trap door to the lower level, they'll attack and say ""You can't be in here, %PCRace. And I'm afraid I can't let you leave. The Company wouldn't like that at all."" It's fairly easy to break in undetected, however, by standing behind part of the wall near the trap door, out of sight. You'll find no guards in the lower level. The second crate on the left (near the barrel with candles on top) contains the limeware you need: five cups and five bowls. Options[edit] You can return the items to Alarvyne back in Vivec for 1500 gold.  Alternatively, you can return them to Bolrin in Ebonheart for 500 gold (for pointing out the lack of security in the operation)."

Return to Lorbumol and pay the debt yourself to complete the quest.","Orders[edit] Lorbumol gro-Aglakh in the Vivec Guild of Fighters asks you to return 2,000 septims of debt money from Lirielle Stoine in Ald'ruhn in The Rat in the Pot. Lirielle's Debt[edit] If you talk with Percius Mercius in the Ald'ruhn Guild of Fighters, he will tell you: ""It was not Lirielle Stoine who owed money, but her brother Ranus [sic] Stoine. Ranus [sic] was murdered, and I don't think Lirielle has 2000 septims. You'lll have to either find the gold Ranus [sic] had or pay the 2000 septims yourself."" This is the same story that Lirielle will give you, though she knows that Ruran was killed in Mallapi, northeast of Gnaar Mok, where he went to seek his fortune. If you didn't already confirm this quest by discussing debt money with Lorbumol, you have the option to back out of it, even after discussing debt money with Percius, who will suggest that the contract isn't legitimate.  As a result, Lirielle won't offer the debt money topic unless you go back to Vivec and confirm it.  Meanwhile, Lorbumol has other quests for you to do, which may be accessed by discussing Rufinus Alleius with him, and you may still discuss debt money with Lorbumol later, (or simultaneously), if you wish. If you confirm the quest with 2,000 gold to spare, you may give it to Lorbumol before going to Ald'ruhn, but if you do, Lirielle will be so glad the matter is settled that she won't even talk about Ruran or Mallapi. Mallapi[edit] Though you don't have to go to Mallapi, it may be worth your while, especially if you can't afford to part with the 2,000 gold yourself (well, only 1,000 gold since you get to keep half of the debt). Mallapi is on the hills just northeast of Gnaar Mok as Lirielle mentioned. Ruran's corpse is inside, in a dead end right branch under some water. With the loot from his corpse and the remaining treasure in the caves, you should easily be able to make up the 1,000 gold for the debt. Return to Lorbumol for your 1,000 gold reward (half of the debt money)."

Stealing Anarenen's Devil Tanto[edit] You will quickly find that the guildhall isn't completely unguarded; there is one guard in the entrance, Manis Virmaulese, who immediately engages in combat with you as soon as you enter the guild, forcing you to kill him or simply ignore him. If your Sneak skill is high enough, or you make use of Invisibility or Chameleon spells, you can easily avoid dealing with him.

Defeat Furius Acilius in battle. Return the Lord's Mail to Varus. Travel to Sadrith Mora and ask around town about Draramu Hloran. Go to Abanabi. Kill Draramu Hloran. Return Chrysamere to Varus.","Lord's Mail[edit] Once you've reached the rank of Knight Protector in the Legion, you can perform this quest for the Knight of the Imperial Dragon, Varus Vantinius, found in the Grand Council Chamber in the Duke's Castle in Ebonheart. Varus informs you that in order to become a Knight of the Garland you must retrieve two missing artifacts. The first is the Lord's Mail, which disappeared from the Imperial Commission on the ground floor and to which you are given a key. To start your investigation, talk to the Imperial Magistrate Rufinus Alleius, who suspects the banished legionnaire Furius Acilius, who was talking about the armor and the caves below the castle before he left. A closer inspection reveals how the thief got in, via a well-hidden and locked (95) door located in the Imperial Shrine itself (Someone forgot to wipe their feet).  If you are a skilled enough thief, this should pose no problem to you, but you can also find the Worn Imperial Key in Acilius' room, in the southwest portion of Imperial Guard Garrison, underneath his pillow. The secret door leads to a small cave where Acilius is trying on the missing armor. After a short talk, he will attack you; kill him in a tougher-than-average fight and retrieve the armor. There is more loot in the cave; see the notes. Return the armor to Vantinius (don't worry, you'll get it back soon). If you would rather not risk getting caught, you can walk from the main entrance of Ebonheart along the path. When the path turns right, continue over the hill on the left. This should bring you to a sandy area. Swim through the water to the tip of the peninsula. Under the water, you should reach a door leading to the underground caves. When you enter, kill all of the rats, then kill Furius, and you can leave out the way you came. If you still want to get into the room with the secret door, swim through the pool of water by his camp, and you will see a floating crate. Inside is the key to the secret wall door. If you refuse to give Varus the armor twice, he will get offended and attack you. This will not have any legal consequences or expel you from the Legion, but it will prevent you from dueling him later for the last rank. After you give Varus the Lord's Mail, he will give you the Duke's Guard Silver Cuirass he was originally wearing. Chrysamere[edit] The second artifact to recover is the legendary sword, Chrysamere, which was stolen by another knight. Spies have learned that the sword is in the possession of the sorceress Draramu Hloran near Sadrith Mora. If you travel to Sadrith Mora and ask around town, you'll quickly learn that everyone is scared to death of Hloran and won't speak a word of her to you. You'll have to boost an NPC's disposition to at least 75 in order to get one to spill the beans. Hloran can be found in the cave Abanabi, southwest of town on a large island. Hloran, among other things in the cave, can be found in a slightly concealed side corridor. Note that there are many leveled Daedra of random sorts in the cave. Once you kill her, return the sword to Vantinius. If you refuse to give him Chrysamere, he will attack you."

It turns out that Wulf was actually the manifestation of the god Tiber Septim. If you talk to Lalatia Varian at the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart, she will explain this event and you'll gain two Reputation points.

Arethan is in a cave known as Milk and is harassing travelers by demanding tribute. Milk is found a bit to the west of Ald'ruhn. Athyn Sarethi wants this matter solved, but he doesn't want his old friend killed if it can be avoided. He suggests talking to Arethan's father, Llerar Mandas, in Ebonheart. Arethan's Madness[edit] You can visit Arethan Mandas anytime. He is not hostile, but you have to get past his hostile guards. Arethan will talk to you, but all you will get is some mad talk. He mentions Delyna and Tel Fyr. The simplest and quickest method is to just kill Arethan, though there is another solution. Sarethi mentions that Arethan's father, Llerar Mandas, can be found in the Grand Council Chambers in Ebonheart, and that you might want to talk to him before traveling to Milk. Llerar will tell you that his son went mad after Divayth Fyr kidnapped Arethan's daughter, Delyna, and believes that the return of Delyna just might cure Arethan's madness. Rescuing Arethan's Daughter[edit] Tel Fyr is located a small distance southwest of Sadrith Mora. There are no travel services, so swimming is required. Delyna Mandas can be found in the Onyx Hall of Tel Fyr, behind a locked (60) and trapped door. The door can be opened with Divayth's 1008th Key, or alternatively you can pick the lock or cast an Open spell. Nobody in Tel Fyr seems to care if you rescue her, Divayth himself cannot be concerned with such petty matters. Escort Delyna outside. Once there, she will give you an amulet which you can show to Arethan as proof that she is alive. Curing Arethan[edit] Travel to Milk and show Arethan the amulet and he will become slightly more sane and promise to stop demanding tribute. His guards will become friendly, if you haven't disposed of them on your way in.

According to one interpretation of the Armistice, only the Mages Guild can officially offer spells and training to non-members. He asks you to speak with the House Redoran Councilors in Ald'ruhn. If you can convince at least three councilors, the Telvanni will have enough support in the Grand Council to end the monopoly. He also suggests that you start with Athyn Sarethi, as he seems to be the most open-minded. Lifting the Monopoly[edit] Go and visit Athyn Sarethi in his manor in Ald'ruhn. Athyn will agree if you raise his Disposition above 50. He will also tell you that the other councilors may agree to overturn the monopoly if you make an 'appeal to fairness.' He will also advise you that one councilor, Bolvyn Venim, will certainly not support the change. The other four councilors are Miner Arobar, Garisa Llethri, Hlaren Ramoran and Brara Morvayn. The first three can be found in their respective manors, which can be accessed from the main hub under-Skar. Brara Morvayn can be found in her quarters within the Redoran Council Hall. They will each agree to support the ending of the monopoly only if you use the conversation topic 'appeal to fairness' and their disposition is above 40. They will not agree if you simply mention the monopoly directly. You must therefore talk to Sarethi first to get the 'appeal to fairness' topic before you can convince the other councilors. Don't bother talking to Venim: he will not agree no matter what you do. Once you have the support of at least three councilors, return to Aryon to complete the quest and receive Aryon's Dominator (a magic glove that casts Command Human and Creature). If you happened to 'accidentally' kill any Redoran councilors along the way (this does not count Bolvyn Venim dying in a duel if you are doing the Redoran Hortator quest at the same time as this one), you can complete the quest but will not receive the magic glove or the disposition and reputation boosts."

Activate the shrine with your four hearts to receive the poem Four Corners of the House of Troubles and the Blessings of the First Corner.","Duties[edit] Once you reach the rank of Diviner, Endryn Llethan‎ at the High Fane in the Vivec's Temple Canton will tell you that Archcanon Tholer Saryoni wishes to speak with you. He will give you the key to the Archcanon's quarters in the Crosier of the High Fane. Go speak with the Archcanon and he  will ask you to perform yet more pilgrimages, this time the Pilgrimages of the Four Corners. You must visit and activate four shrines related to the four 'bad' Daedra Lords (Four Corners of the House of Troubles). The shrines must be visited the correct order for you to be able to complete the pilgrimages. Visit Saryoni after you complete each portion to get more information on the next part. Archcanon Saryoni then tells you that the First Corner of the House of Troubles is Malacath. Visit his shrine southwest of Dagon Fel (west of Mzuleft, nestled in some hills) with four Daedra's Hearts and recite the poem Four Corners of the House of Troubles. Malacath of the House of Troubles[edit] If you've been fighting any Daedra, chances are you have a good supply of hearts already, but if not, a good number of alchemist shops also sell them (Nalcarya of White Haven in Balmora for example). Once you have your hearts, find the shrine, which is simply a large Statue of Malacath surrounded by a number of Orc worshippers. Approach the shrine and activate it with four hearts in your inventory to receive the poem (which you don't really have to recite) and the Blessings of the First Corner   - Fortify Strength 10-20 pts for 48 mins on Touch. Return to Archcanon Saryoni in Vivec for instructions on the next Corner of the House of Troubles."

Return to Malacath's Statue and receive Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw as your reward.","Malacath's Request[edit] The shrine is located in Assurdirapal in the Sheogorad region on the long island west of Dagon Fel (just west of the Sanctus Shrine island). Talk to Malacath and he will tell you a story about an elven hero by the name of Oreyn Bearclaw. Actually, he is no hero at all but was falsely credited with the deeds done by his friend, an Orc named Kharag gro-Khar. Malacath wants you to destroy Bearclaw's legend by killing the last of his bloodline. If you do, you will receive the Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw as your reward. Killing the False Hero[edit] Farvyn Oreyn and his bodyguards Head toward Vivec as suggested by Malacath to begin your search for the descendant. You should be able to find out that the last of Bearclaw's line is Farvyn Oreyn and that you can find him near Gnaar Mok. Ask some townsfolk to find out where he is, south of town. You will find him clad in Dwemer armor and in the company of two bodyguards. If you talk to him, he will freely admit that the legend of Oreyn Bearclaw is a falsehood. Telling him you have come from Malacath, or promising to keep the truth a secret will result in him and his guards attacking you. Farvyn is fairly easy to kill, but his two bodyguards are not, so be careful. Once you have killed him, return to the shrine to pick up your reward."

Escort Teris to Agrippina Herennia's Clothing Shop.","A Man and His Guar[edit] North of Vivec, along the road north of the Gro-Bagrat Plantation, you will come across Teris Raledran and his guar Rollie. Teris and company are in need of an escort to Agrippina Herennia's clothing shop in Vivec's Foreign Quarter, Canalworks level. A Safe Spot For Rollie[edit] The catch here is that you don't need to actually escort both Teris and the guar the entire way. For some reason, guar are not permitted inside Vivec's city limits. Instead of trying to cross the bridge west into Vivec, head further south and Teris should pipe up, commenting that here would be a good spot to leave Rollie. Entering the City[edit] You can now head into the city and on to Agrippina's without trouble. Once you reach the shop's front door, Teris will reward you with 200 gold (or just 100 gold if you accidentally or intentionally killed his guar)."

Unfortunately, conversation with Din is difficult as you will quickly discover. Choose the dialogue options of catch some slaughterfish followed by muddled to receive the option to cure him. Curing Din requires some form of Cure Common Disease, though if you don't have any handy you can get Din to follow you to Mehra Drora, the healer in the basement of the Gnisis Temple.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Manwe%27s_Dues","Talk to Ranis Athrys in the Balmora Guild of Mages for duties. Travel to Punabi, and find Manwe. Collect Manwe's dues or kill her. Return to Balmora.","Duties[edit] This is one of the first quests offered by Ranis Athrys in the Balmora Guild of Mages once you reach the rank of Journeyman. This and the quest Recruit or Kill Llarar Bereloth are offered at the same time, but are considered separate and will each raise your standing within the Guild. Ranis will ask you to collect a debt from Manwe, who has failed to pay her dues for several years, and now owes over 2000 septims. Allegedly she is researching something in Punabi, near Llarar Bereloth in Sulipund. If you can convince Manwe to pay the dues, Ranis will split them with you. Otherwise, kill her. Traveling to Punabi[edit] Ranis tells you that Punabi is north of the Dunmer stronghold Marandus, and she marks Marandus on the map. This still leaves you with the decision on how to get to Marandus. The overland route doesn't really have a clear path due to mountains, which complicate travel. Without levitation, the trip can be difficult and is a far distance away. The other option is to take a Silt Strider to Suran, and then swim up the river that runs beside the town to Lake Nabia. Besides the occasional slaughterfish coming from the deep and the occasional cliff racer coming from above, there shouldn't be that much of a problem with creatures. Once you arrive at the lake, just get out on the shore and you'll be very close to Marandus. Now just follow Ranis' directions to get to Punabi. Manwe[edit] Once you get to Punabi, briefly follow the cave until you find Manwe. Use either Speechcraft or bribes to get her Disposition up to 60, and she will fork over 2000 gold, the required sum (half of which is kept as a reward). If you kill her, you do not get such a large monetary reward, as she has far less money on her corpse, and your disposition reward is only five, rather than fifteen.  However, if you get her to give you the 2000 gold, THEN kill her, you can keep all 2000 gold for yourself (minus 10 disposition), as Ranis assumes Manwe did not give you the money. A final alternative is just to pay Ranis yourself, but you must travel to Punabi and speak to Manwe before you are given this option."

Speak to Tinti and Hairan and either obtain the hides through force, being an adopted Ashlander, or allow them to keep the hides. Return to Marsus Tullius. If you brought back the hides, go to Stentus Tullius in Tel Aruhn for a reward.","Stolen Hides[edit] Find Marsus Tullius northwest of the Erabenimsun Camp and northeast of Uvirith's Grave. He has been robbed by two Ashlanders who stole some guar hides from him, and asks you to find the thieves and return the hides. Return to the camp and ask around to learn the Ashlanders responsible are actually the respected warriors Hairan and Tinti, who were probably offended in some manner by Marsus. Speak to the warriors in the camp to confirm the story that Marsus was stealing hides from the camp's herds, and they merely took back what was rightfully theirs. If you've already completed the quest Meet Sul-Matuul (part of the main quest), the two warriors will simply give you the hides. Allowing the Ashlanders to keep the Hides[edit] If you refuse to take them you'll receive a Herder's Belt. When you return to Marsus Tullius he will apologize, saying that he had no idea the hides were from guars belonging to the Erabenimsun Camp. He goes on to say that his father will not be able to pay you a reward since it relied on delivery of the hides. If you talk to Stentus next time you are in Tel Aruhn he will also thank you and express his regret that he cannot reward you. Returning the hides to Marsus[edit] If you are not yet an Ashlander or if you take the hides from the Ashlanders, you must either kill the two warriors or pick their pockets to get the hides. Once you return the hides to Tullius, he will refer you to his father Stentus in Tel Aruhn for a reward. Visit Stentus walking around Tel Aruhn for a 200 gold reward. Unfortunately for this quest, you cannot return just any guar hides to Marsus."

Return to Habasi to finish the quest.","Job[edit] Sugar-Lips Habasi in the South Wall Cornerclub in Balmora asks you to help her by locating a fellow Thieves Guild master of Security who is living in town so that he may help secure the South Wall Cornerclub. All that she knows is that he is an Altmer (High Elf), and suggests that you ask around since there are only a few Altmer living in Balmora. Inquiries About Altmer in Town[edit] Just about anyone in Balmora will be able to identify the six Altmer in town: Altmer ""The only Altmer here in Balmora are Culumaire at the Lucky Lockup, Estirdalin at the Guild of Mages, Imare at the Hlaalu Council Manor, Nalcarya of White Haven the Alchemist, and Hecerinde and Tyermaillin who both have residences here."" It's a matter of some footwork to walk around and talk to each one, but you can eventually find out that Hecerinde is the security master. A Chat with Hecerinde[edit] Hecerinde is at his house in Balmora, on the east bank of the Odai River running through town, up on the north end. Chat with Hecerinde about security and South Wall and he'll admit to having neglected his duties to the Thieves Guild, agreeing to help Habasi with her request. Return to Habasi[edit] Return to Habasi with the news to complete the quest. If you have any bounties on your head at this time, she will reset your bounty back to zero.

Huleeya Informant Meet with Huleeya at the Black Shalk Cornerclub in the Foreign Quarter. Calm the locals and escort Huleeya to Jobasha's Bookshop to receive his notes. Addhiranirr Informant Meet with Addhiranirr in the Underworks of the St. Olms Canton. Find and tell the excise agent Duvianus Platorius that Addhiranirr has left for the mainland. Receive the information from Addhiranirr. Meet Mehra Milo Meet with Mehra Milo at the Library of Vivec in the Temple Canton. Steal or buy the book Progress of Truth. Return to Caius in Balmora.","Huleeya Addhiranirr Mehra Milo Orders from Caius[edit] After the last errand, Caius tells you to train for a while and come back to him later. Specifically, your character needs to be at least level 3 before Caius will give you the next assignment. At that point, he sends you on a fact-finding mission to the city of Vivec. Your mission is to track down and rendezvous with three people: Addhiranirr, a Khajiit Thieves Guild member in St. Olms, Huleeya, an Argonian Morag Tong assassin at the Black Shalk Cornerclub in the Foreign Quarter, and Mehra Milo, a Tribunal Temple priestess in the Hall of Wisdom of the Temple Canton. Caius is once again looking for any Sixth House or Nerevarine Cult information and he gives you 200 gold for expenses. The quickest way is to take the Silt Strider or the Mages Guild Guide, but feel free to take the scenic route. Huleeya Informant[edit] Huleeya is in the Black Shalk Cornerclub, in the Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks. He should be easy to find, as he is the only Argonian in the room. Unfortunately, Huleeya seems to be having trouble with the locals, who will not let him pass. Talk with the Dark Elf, Ethys Savil, or one of his two friends, and persuade him to leave the Argonian alone. Raising his disposition a bit will work, but so will homicide. If you try to leave with Huleeya without talking to one of the thugs, they will attack and you will have to protect Huleeya. Attacking the thugs first will result in Huleeya refusing to talk to you. Once you've solved this, you may escort Huleeya unhindered to Jobasha's Rare Books. Jobasha's bookshop is on the same level as the cornerclub, in the Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks, just on the opposite side. Once you're inside the bookshop with Huleeya, you will receive one Reputation point for your help and he will give you some notes to take to Caius. Also while at the bookshop, pick up the book Progress of Truth on the second floor far left bookcase as you will be needing it later in this quest. You can steal it when the Ordinator patrols elsewhere, or just buy it. Addhiranirr Informant[edit] Addhiranirr is the next closest contact in the St. Olms Canton, southeast of the Foreign Quarter (past the Redoran and next to the St. Delyn cantons). It turns out Addhiranirr is difficult to find as almost no one in St. Olms knows where she is. With enough exploration and questions, you do eventually find her all alone in the northeast Underworks, hiding from a Census and Excise agent. In order to get anything out of her, the agent must be taken care of. The agent in question is Duvianus Platorius, who can be found in St. Olms Waistworks. As usual, you can either kill him or persuade him that Addhiranirr has fled. Note that if you happen to accidentally tell him where Addhiranirr is, you can still get the information Caius wants by raising Addhiranirr's disposition until she will talk to you. Also, if you tell Duvianus Platorius where Addhiranirr is and come back later to talk about the topic 'Addhiranirr', he will give you the response normally given if you had chosen to lie to him. Anyway, once the agent is out of the way, Addhiranirr will let you know that the Sixth House is into smuggling, but no one knows what due to intense secrecy. Meet Mehra Milo[edit] The last of the contacts is Mehra Milo. She may be found in the Library of Vivec, located in the Hall of Wisdom in the Temple Canton at the southern end of Vivec. Once you find her and follow her to the back of the library, she will tell you what she knows about the Nerevarine cult. She'll also suggest that you obtain a copy of the book Progress of Truth for Caius. Although the library has a copy of the book, it is under guard, so she suggests trying the local bookshops, even though the book is officially banned by the Tribunal Temple. The copy in the library is the tall book on top of the bookshelf in the southwest corner. Alternatively, you can just buy a copy from Jobasha's Rare Books in the Lower Waistworks of the Foreign Quarter for 150 gold. Other copies can be found at: Tel Uvirith, Arelas' House Vivec, Hall of Justice Secret Library Vivec, Telvanni Tower Return to Caius[edit] Return the information to Caius, who will promote you to Journeyman and suggest you take more time to train and do some other guild work to keep your cover up. Come back for the next part of the quest in a few days."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Meet_Sul-Matuul","Return to Caius in Balmora to receive your orders. Travel up to the Urshilaku Camp, east of Khuul. Meet with Zabamund and then Sul-Matuul. Retrieve the Bonebiter Bow for Sul-Matuul from the Urshilaku Burial Caverns. Return to Sul-Matuul and receive permission to speak with Nibani Maesa. Meet with Nibani Maesa for her opinions on the Nerevarine Prophecies.","Orders from Caius[edit] The proverbial plot has thickened significantly by this point as Caius gives you a decoded copy of the original package you delivered to him, revealing that the Emperor intends to use you to fulfill the Nerevarine Prophecies, ensuring that things go his way. Caius will give you 200 gold and promote you to Finder of the Blades. He will instruct you to see Somutis Vunnis and Crulius Pontanian at Moonmoth Legion Fort (the fort is just east of Balmora, near the path to Arkngthand; Vunnis and Pontanian are in the chapel and the services hall, respectively) before heading up to see the leaders of the Nerevarine Cult at Urshilaku Camp, Sul-Matuul and Nibani Maesa. You can skip the visit to Moonmoth Legion Fort if you don't need any useful scrolls and potions, but they can be very handy at low levels; talk to Crulius and Somutis about essential supplies to receive the items. Visit the Urshilaku Camp[edit] The camp is quite far, up on the northern coast of Vvardenfell (it should be marked on your in-game map at this point). You could just walk north through the foyadas, but the journey may be dangerous due to, among other things, large numbers of cliff racers. It is not too far depending on how many dungeons and towns you stop at along the way (of course, this is half the fun, or perhaps more). The quickest way is to take the silt strider or the guild guide from Balmora to Ald'ruhn, and, from there, take the silt strider to either Khuul or Maar Gan. The camp is a little way east from Khuul and north from Maar Gan. The journey from Khuul is shorter and safer, though there are almost no places of interest along the way. The camp is small, so be careful not to miss it. The Ashlanders are not particularly friendly but if you remember what Hassour told you about giving thoughtful gifts (items, bribes), you will make inroads into Urshilaku society easily. The hunters outside the yurts (huts) accept Trama Root, while Tussurradad accepts kwama eggs, both large and small. Alternatively, a simple Charm spell or a bribe of 100 gold will work on anybody (depending on your Speechcraft skill, 10 gold might work as well). If you are able to raise their disposition enough just via persuasion then you won't need to worry about gifts or bribes at all. In any case, once you have impressed one of residents, they will direct you to speak with Zabamund, Sul-Matuul's second, in his yurt. Meet with Zabamund[edit] To speak with Zabamund, you must raise your disposition with him to around 70 or higher first. Zabamund will then ask you to give him a reason to let you meet with the Ashkhan. A variety of answers are at your disposal: Offer to fight a duel to the death under the condition that your level is at 6 or above Boast of your deeds if either your Speechcraft level is 30 or above or if your Reputation meets or exceeds a value of 20 State all that you have learned of the Sixth House and the Nerevarine, provided your Speechcraft is at or above 30 Offer a tribute of 200 gold pieces, without needing to raise Zabamund's disposition or possess any other skills As a result of any successful approach, Zabamund next sends you to the Ashkhan's yurt. Urshilaku Burial Caverns map Meet with Sul-Matuul[edit] If you have not first received permission from Zabamund, Sul-Matuul may immediately attack you. Once you have permission, however, there is no need to raise Sul-Matuul's disposition when meeting with him - he will speak to you straight away. As you are an outlander, Sul-Matuul is unsure of your intentions, and requires you to pass an initiation rite in order to be adopted into the Urshilaku Tribe as a Clanfriend. You are asked to travel to the tribal burial site and retrieve the Bonebiter Bow of Sul-Senipul, the weapon of his father. Upon returning with the bow, you will have proven your worth to the tribe. Urshilaku Burial Caverns[edit] Directions to the Urshilaku Burial Caverns are given, but can be rather confusing, and take you there via a pointlessly long route. Ignore them, and head south-southeast from the camp for a short distance; if you reach Abinabi cave, go east. Note that the actual map name of the site is Urshilaku, Astral Burial (the chamber where you enter the caverns). The caverns are larger than most of the tombs scattered throughout the island, and filled with skeletons and cave rats. Go through the Astral Burial chamber (the entrance area) into the Karma Burial, and then enter the Laterus Burial. You may visit the various chambers at each stage, but your goal lies within the Juno Burial, found at the top of the spiral. At the far end of this chamber you encounter the Wraith of Sul-Senipul who carries (but for some reason doesn't use) the Bonebiter Bow of Sul-Senipul, which you must retrieve. Return to Sul-Matuul[edit] Upon your return with the bow to Sul-Matuul at the Urshilaku Camp, he congratulates you on completing the initiation rite and names you Clanfriend of the Ashlanders, thereby permitting you to talk to Nibani Maesa. As a bonus, you get to keep the bow and rest in any bed in the camp, although he prohibits you from stealing from any other member of your new faction. Meet with Nibani Maesa[edit] Maesa is in the Wise Woman's Yurt and has lots of very important answers regarding the prophecy. When she has finished, ask her if you pass the test. (You must ask at this question, whether early or late, to get quest stage 60 in your Journal, or the quest will not be completed.)  It seems that although you are not the Nerevarine, you are one who may become the Nerevarine. In order to know more, Maesa asks you to find the Lost Prophecies and bring them to her, so that she may guide you better. She also gives you a copy of The Stranger and The Seven Visions relating to the Nerevarine Prophecy. This extended conversation with Maesa produces many dialogue topics; you should probably explore all of them as they are more relevant than average to the main quest's plot and what is coming up in your adventures. When you have the required Journal entry, which ends with ""Now it's time to report back to Caius"", you may do so for your next assignment and a reward of 400 gold."

Kill the ghost of Kanit Ashurnisammis to have Minabibi agree to the meeting. Return to the Ahemmusa Camp and ask Sinnammu for permission. Return to Wolverine Hall.","Duties[edit] Skink-in-Tree's-Shade in the Wolverine Hall Mage's Guild asks you to arrange a meeting with a wise woman of one of the four Ashlander tribes: Urshilaku, Zainab, Erabenimsun, or the Ahemmusa. Skink doubts that the Erabenimsun will agree and suggests to start with the Ahemmusa. For the record, none of the other Ashlander Wise Women will agree to meet with him (and the Wise Women of outcast Ashlander tribes don't get arrange a meeting as a conversation topic). At the Ahemmusa Camp[edit] If you've gotten far in the Main Quest, you should know the location to all four camps (and they will be marked on your map). The Ahemmusa Camp is on the far northeast corner of the island, north of Tel Vos (northwest of Tel Mora). When you talk to the Wise Woman of the camp, Sinnammu Mirpal, she refuses to meet with Skink, but suggests her apprentice, Minabibi Assardarainat. She is in the Favel Ancestral Tomb, west of the camp, past the Daedric ruins. Arranging the Meeting[edit] When you find Minabibi Assardarainat just inside the tomb, she agrees to meet with Skink but you must first kill the spirit of the tomb for her, the spirit of Kanit Ashurnisammis. You can trap the 280 point grand soul of Kanit with no penalty, so make sure to bring a grand soul gem! Once you get rid of the spirit, Minabibi tells you to return to Sinnammu to get permission for her to meet with Skink. Do so, noting that no matter what you say to Sinnammu, she will let Minabibi go.  If you take credit for calming the spirit, her Disposition will increase by 20 points; lying and telling her that Minabibi was responsible will get you a ten point disposition penalty instead. When you return to the guild hall, Minabibi is already there waiting for you. Talk to Skink to finish the quest and receive the usual increase in Disposition, as well as +2 Reputation. Speak with Minabibi afterwards to receive an Ancestor's Ring."

Travel to Vivec and look for Mehra Milo in the Library of Vivec and her quarters. Visit the Ministry of Truth and have the guard Alvela Saram let you in. Find the prison cells and Milo, giving her a Scroll of Divine Intervention for her escape. Travel to Holamayan to meet up with Mehra Milo and the Dissident Priests. Talk with Gilvas Barelo in Holamayan to receive the lost prophecies.","Milo's note on the dresser in her private quarters Orders from Caius[edit] Return to Caius Cosades in Balmora after being cured of Corprus over in Tel Fyr. Once again you are promoted, this time to Operative. Caius informs you that, for various reasons, he is being recalled to the Imperial City, which actually makes you head of the Blades in Vvardenfell. Talk to Caius about your new promotion to get some handy items as well as use of his house. His last orders to you before he leaves are to continue to investigate the lost prophecies, and to bring them to Nibani Maesa in the Urshilaku Camp once you find them. The first step is to meet Mehra Milo again in the Hall of Wisdom in Vivec's Temple Canton, and tell her what you have learned from the Urshilaku. Milo was being watched and left a message in her private quarters under the code word AMAYA. Looking for Milo[edit] Get to the Hall of Wisdom in Vivec to look for Milo. If you search the library, you will discover that she is no longer there. Ask the other librarians about her and they will tell you that her private quarters are opposite the Canon Offices in the Hall of Wisdom. Her quarters are locked (level 20) but by this point you should have spells, scrolls or picks to gain entry. The key can even be found behind a drape near the door. Milo is not in, but there is a Note to Amaya on the dresser. The note says that Milo is visiting the Inquisitor at the Ministry of Truth and that you should bring two Divine Intervention scrolls. She goes on to mention that the guard, Alvela Saram, will let you past if you mention you are looking for her and that she has left two levitation potions for you to use. Clearly, Milo has been imprisoned by the Ordinators and has left this coded message in the hope that you would find it. The Ministry of Truth Ministry of Truth[edit] The Ministry of Truth is the large meteor floating over the Temple Canton, which can only be reached using levitation. You can use a levitation potion or spell, or instead you can make an offering to the Shrine to Stop the Moon, located below the ministry. You will need to donate a potion of rising force (a bargain, cheap, standard, quality, or exclusive potion will work, but not a custom potion). In exchange for your donation, you are blessed with a powerful levitation spell (100 points for 1440 seconds). Make sure you remember the two Divine Intervention scrolls. You can buy them from Janand Maulinie in the Mages Guild in the Foreign Quarter. Outside the top entrance to the ministry you will find the guard Alvela Saram. Talking with Alvela reveals that Milo is a prisoner and you are tasked with breaking her out. She gives you the main key and suggests to enter using the back door, which is the door furthest from Alvela. There are many locked doors inside the Ministry. They can be opened either by finding their respective keys or by lock picking them. Once you enter the Ministry using the back door, immediately go right. Do not let anyone see you as they will attack and call the guards. The guards here are well armored and hit hard, so unless you're prepared, a stealthy approach may be best (any form of invisibility or chameleon helps). The Prison Keep is at the top of the Ministry and has only a level 20 lock guarding it. The Ministry of Truth Sector Key unlocks this door and is to the right of the upper entrance in the Grand Inquisitor's desk. Once you enter the Prison Keep, you may be attacked by a few guards, so be careful. Mehra is located in the rightmost holding cell and there are a few ways to go about reaching her, none of which are any more correct than the other.  You may use levitation to fly over the guards and reach Mehra's cell.  Make your way to her however you can and don't worry if you are backed into a corner and forced to fight: you will not incur a bounty for killing any of the Ordinators. Bluffing your way through the Ministry[edit] If you have a Temple rank of less than level 5 (Adept), or are not a Temple member at all, your disposition with the Inquisitor is at least 70 (this can be achieved with a charm spell, if necessary), and you are not of a beast race, you can bluff your way past the Grand Inquisitor and the other guards by donning an Indoril helmet, cuirass, and pauldrons, and then talking to the Grand Inquisitor and  telling him that you have ""proper authorization"". He will give you his key and the guards will refuse to attack you. Alternatively, if you are at least Adept rank in the Temple, or have a disposition of 100 with the guards prior to speaking to them the guards will not attack you unless you talk to them twice (they give you a ""leave or die"" warning the first time) or enter the prison area. Be warned, however, that once any guard attacks you, whatever the reason, all ministry guards in the area will then attack you on sight, and once this happens, they will behave like enemies, not normal guards, that is, they will forever try to kill you unless you kill them, or temporarily stop the fight with a calm spell (and even then, they will refuse to speak to you normally). Also note that if you have the Morrowind Patch Project installed, and you are Patriarch of the Temple, most of the guards in the Ministry will not only allow you to pass, but if spoken to, will give you helpful advice regarding the acquisition of keys and avoidance of potential hostiles. They will, however, protest the irregularity of your demands for access to the Ministry. Milo in her cell Escaping with Milo[edit] Once you find Mehra, she outlines the escape plan. You are to give her one Divine Intervention scroll for her to make her escape, and you escape the same way or another, as you like. Using the other Divine Intervention scroll teleports you Ebonheart. You are to meet each other at the secret Dissident Priests Monastery of Holamayan. You are to meet a woman on the east docks of Ebonheart (just southwest of Vivec) named Blatta Hateria. Tell Blatta that Mehra sent you and that you want to go fishing. Blatta will then bring you to Holamayan where you and Milo will meet up. Once there, you'll receive the lost prophecies from the Dissident Priests' leader Gilvas Barelo. Additionally, the entrance to Holamayan is concealed with magic. Speak to Vevrana Aryon, a monk on the dock at Holamayan about it. Traveling to Holamayan[edit] You can leave the Ministry however you wish, although teleporting out via Recall or intervention is obviously the easiest way. If you use a Divine Intervention scroll as suggested, you'll end up in the middle of Ebonheart, which is rather convenient. Blatta is on the left side of the docks, and will ask if she knows you. Once you mention you want to go fishing, the option to travel to Holamayan will be added to her destination list (labeled as Azura's Coast Region). You will have to pay her for the trip. Vevrana is on the docks across from you when you arrive, and she will tell you that the magical shield guarding Holamayan opens only at dusk and dawn, meaning you will probably have to rest until the proper time. She also can arrange your trip back to Vivec when you choose. Dusk and dawn times are 6pm to 8pm and 6am to 8am, respectively. You are able to rest on the grass outside the entrance, instead of waiting. Mehra Milo and Gilvas Barelo in the Holamayan Monastery Dissident Priests and Lost Prophecies[edit] You can find Mehra with Gilvas Barelo just off to the right in the library when you enter Holamayan. Gilvas has some information on Dagoth Ur, among other things, as well as the lost prophecies that you have been looking for. You receive three notes from him relating to the prophecies: The Lost Prophecy, The Seven Curses and Kagrenac's Tools. Talking to him about Nerevar also nets you three more books. Make sure you exhaust all dialogue possibilities with Gilvas to get all the information that you can. By all accounts, you are becoming closer and closer to being the true Nerevarine. Now that Caius is gone, you have no one to report to, but don't forget that Nibani Maesa in the Urshilaku Camp wanted to speak with you again once you've found the lost prophecies."

If you inquire further, you'll learn that Mephala wishes you to poison Balyn Omavel, an important member of the Morag Tong who has been performing assassinations without writs.

Kaye believes Caryarel lives along the coasts, but he suggests asking other High Elves if they can pinpoint his location.

Another option is Fainertil, down by the docks. They tell you he lives in Gnaar Mok, a small village on the coast west of Caldera. To get there, take a ship from the docks to Hla Oad and then straight on to Gnaar Mok. In Gnaar Mok, Caryarel wanders the docks outside his shack, which is to your left if you arrived by ship.

You will eventually be directed to Elam Andas in the Office of the Watch in Vivec's Hall of Justice, Temple Canton, for more information. Mysterious Killings in Vivec[edit] The murders were strange in that although all the victims were armed, it appears that only one of the seven, a mage, had put up a fight, and nothing was removed from the bodies.  Three victims were found in the Foreign Quarter, one in the water surrounding the Arena, one in the Hlaalu Compound, and the two guards near the Hlaalu victim (the last two are believed to be related). The fact that the two guards did not have their weapons drawn brings the concern that the murderer is incredibly powerful.  Finally, although there are no witnesses, there is a report of someone being threatened by a Dark Elf woman wearing a skirt and Netch armor, and wielding a dagger. More Detective Work[edit] Ask around about the murders and the woman in the Hlaalu Compound, Arena, and Foreign Quarter. From the Foreign Quarter you'll learn that a Dark Elf woman was seen in the underworks of the canton. Still vague, but it is worth checking out. Bring an End to the Murders[edit] Enter the west side of the Underworks in the Foreign Quarter. The woman in question is indeed the culprit, which is basically confirmed when she attacks you on sight (she is a red-haired Dreamer Prophet). She is wielding a Dagoth Dagger, which rapidly drains its victim's fatigue, so beware. This explains why the two dead guards were unable to draw their swords after being surprised. Deliver the Good News[edit] Report back to Andas when she is dead to receive a choice of an Indoril Helm and Cuirass, or the Belt of the Armor of God, a belt that fortifies Willpower while casting Sanctuary and Shield spells. Remember—if you initiate conversation with an Ordinator or vice versa while wearing the helm or cuirass, it will permanently trigger all Ordinators to attack you on sight."

He doesn't seem to have a good idea on how to do this, and he doesn't even seem to care very much about how you do this, though he suggests to speak with Edwinna Elbert at the Ald'ruhn guildhall. Gathering the Books[edit] In the last few Mages Guild quests given by Edwinna you may (and should have) picked up three different books related to the Dwemer: Hanging Gardens of Wasten Coridale, The Egg of Time, and Divine Metaphysics. You may have also already talked with Hasphat Antabolis at the bottom of the Balmora Fighters Guild or Senilias Cadiusus in Nchuleftingth who mention that Hanging Gardens of Wasten Coridale seems to be written in both Dwemeris and Aldmeris and may be a key to deciphering the other two books. You need to find someone who can read Aldmeris. Finding a Translator[edit] Since you've done so many Dwemer-related quests for Edwinna, she's the logical starting point for anything further Dwemer-related. After discussing ""The Egg of Time"" with her, she will point you to a fellow scholar, Hasphat Antabolis, though neither one of them can fully understand the three texts. It seems Aldmeris is over their heads. They don't mention anyone by name but Baladas Demnevanni in Gnisis' Arvs-Drelen is the next stop. If you have joined House Telvanni you may have already encountered him, and will probably be aware that he's also something of a Dwemer historian, and fortunately he's more familiar with Aldmeris. Baladas will give you enough information to report back to Trebonius to finish the quest, but if you want a more complete story, you'll need to speak to someone even older. Possibly the oldest character in Morrowind is in Tel Fyr. Speak with Divayth Fyr and he'll mention that he has the last living Dwemer, by the name of Yagrum Bagarn, living in his Corprusarium. Yagrum, of course, can understand the books written in Dwemeris and will offer overviews of them along with his own theories. Return to Trebonius[edit] Although you don't get any definitive, conclusive answers, discussing the Egg of Time with either Yagrum or Baladas while you also have Divine Metaphysics, constitutes successful completion of the quest (for Baladas you must also have Hanging Gardens). Trebonius will be shocked that someone actually completed one of his missions, and he'll try to play it off like he's not in way over his head.

Return to Mercius for payment.","The Orders[edit] Percius Mercius in the Ald'ruhn Guild of Fighters asks you to help the Buoyant Armiger Ulyne Henim clean out a den of necromancers in Vas. Journey to Vas[edit] Vas is found far to the north in the Sheogorad Region (when you ask Percius about Vas, it will be marked on your map). The quickest route is to grab a boat to Dagon Fel. An alternative route is to go north to Maar Gan, then farther north along the Foyada Bani-Dad until you reach the coast. Follow the shore eastwards until you reach the Urshilaku Camp, then swim (or waterwalk) northeast. You'll find Ulyne Henim just outside the entrance to Vas. She's clad in the customary chitin armor of the Buoyant Armigers. Talk with Ulyne to join up together and enter the den. She fights with a staff and summons ancestor ghosts to help her in combat. The Necromancer of Vas[edit] In the entryway, there's the usual collection of undead to take care of. You don't need to kill the three people in the large room unless they attack you (Debentien Sylbenitte might). In the first level of the tower, you might meet something more considerable, such as a Dremora or a Daedroth. Be prepared, for this area can be fairly tough, especially if you want to keep Ulyne alive as you may end up against up to three powerful opponents at once. The Necromancer Daris Adram, who casts a few spells when he fights, is on the top floor of the tower. Once Daris is dead, Ulyne will thank you for helping and stop following you. If Ulyne is impressed with your performance (Disposition ≥ 70), then she will give you a glowing recommendation. Unless she is accidentally hit several times in combat, this is the most likely outcome.  Otherwise, she will consider your help to have been adequate, but be less impressed. Return to Percius Mercius, who will reward you with 250/500 drakes and a 10/15 point Disposition boost (depending on whether Ulyne gave you a recommendation or not). If Ulyne is killed, you'll receive no reward and Percius' disposition towards you will drop 10 points."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Nels_Llendo_(quest)","","Meet Nels Llendo[edit] You'll run into the suave Nels Llendo on the road south of Pelagiad. To Kiss or not to Kiss[edit] If you are a male character, Nels will politely ask you for 50 gold. If you refuse to pay his fine, or do not have at least 50 gold, he will attack you. He is rather powerful for a starting character to defeat. If you are a female character, all he requests is a kiss. He will not attack you if you deny him the kiss. Not kissing him results in a 10 point disposition loss, while kissing him gives a 30 point increase. Further Uses[edit] If you do pay him the gold (or if you are female), you will find him later on in the Halfway Tavern in Pelagiad, offering training in Short Blade, Security, and Sneak."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Nerano_Manor_Key","Chat with Sugar-Lips Habasi about jobs and Nerano Manor. Acquire a key to Nerano Manor from Ondres Nerano or Sovor Trandel. Give the key to Sugar-Lips Habasi to complete the quest and receive your reward.","Job[edit] Sugar-Lips Habasi in Balmora's South Wall Cornerclub asks you to acquire the key to Nerano Manor. There are two copies, one held by Ondres Nerano in the manor itself (he is downstairs but the key opens the upstairs), and his servant Sovor Trandel, who hangs out at the Council Club (near the Silt Strider). Obtaining the Key[edit] The cleanest (although often hardest) way to acquire the key is to Pickpocket it from one of them. You may want to save so you can reload until you succeed. Alternately, you can kill Sovor (ideally by Taunt or Frenzy to get him to attack you, so you don't get a bounty). He is fully expendable, and if you're also doing Larrius Varro's quest (talk to him at Moonmoth Legion Fort to start it), you're supposed to kill him anyway. If you raise his Disposition to 70 or higher, a Nerano Manor topic will appear; using it will cause him to ask for a little compensation, and it will update your journal. If you successfully bribe again (any amount), he will give you the key. In the unpatched version of the game, another way is to attack Ondres with Hand-to-hand. His skill at it is very low, and he is easily beaten. Once he goes down, you can take the key from him. In the patched game, trying to steal from an unconscious character no longer works. If you kill Ondres, you'll still be able to complete the quest. However, Habasi angrily takes the key without paying you because now the house won't have any new valuables in it for a long, long time. Complete the Quest[edit] Once you have the key be sure to clear out the Manor yourself before returning to Habasi. She'll pay you 500 gold for the key, and that's in addition to anything you already took from the house."

Return to Felisa to complete the quest.","Chores[edit] Felisa Ulessen in the Telvanni Council House in Sadrith Mora will ask you to deliver a skirt to Mistress Therana in Tel Branora. You can find out from Felisa (or from the Main Quest) that Therana can be difficult to work with and you'll receive two Almsivi Intervention scrolls from Felisa in case difficulties arise. New Clothes[edit] Head to Tel Branora (far island in the southeast of the map, reached by boat) and find Therana in the upper tower (like most Telvanni towers, you'll need a Levitate spell). Try and give the new skirt to Therana, who will be worried that it is cursed and asks you to wear it first. As soon as you do, however, she attacks. Don't bother hanging around, just escape by any means available (such as the intervention scrolls). There is only one way around this, however. Ask the Khajiit slave Ra'Zahr next to Therana to wear the skirt instead (just speak with him). Therana will then attack the Khajiit instead. You can save him if you quickly cast a Calm Humanoid spell on Therana. (Due to a bug, you will only need a single point of Calm Humanoid for this to succeed, so any Calm Humanoid spell will work.) Also note that Therana's Skirt appears to be quite common but has properties like an exquisite skirt for enchanting, and you can retrieve it once the slave is dead. Return to Felisa to complete the quest and receive 500 drakes and the Mark and Recall spells if you choose to learn them. If Therana attacks you and you kill her, you will not be able to complete the quest and Felisa will disappear from the Telvanni Council House."

Learn of the Seven Trials (First and Second have already been completed). Find out about the Third Trial from Sul-Matuul. Obtain some Corprus Weepings, a House Dagoth cup, and the Shadow Shield from the ruins of Kogoruhn, southeast of the camp. Return to Matuul with the items to learn the riddle of the Third Trial. Talk with Ashlanders to decode the riddle and find the location of the Cavern of the Incarnate. Travel to the cavern to meet with Azura and learn of the Fourth and Fifth Trials remaining. (Optional) Report back to Nibani Maesa and Sul-Matuul.","Return to the Urshilaku Camp[edit] After successfully rescuing Mehra Milo and learning the lost prophecies from Gilvas Barelo in the secret Holamayan monastery of the Dissident Priests, you should return to Nibani Maesa in the Urshilaku Camp. Again, there's no wrong way to get to the camp, though if you're still in Holamayan, the quickest way would be to use an Intervention scroll/spell to get out and continue on from there. One way to get to the camp is to return to Ebonheart by boat, then speak with the shipmaster Nevosi Hlan to travel to Hla Oad, Gnaar Mok, and finally Khuul, which is the closest to the camp anybody will take you. Learn of the Seven Trials[edit] Once you arrive at the camp, visit Nibani in the Wise Woman's Yurt again and discuss the lost prophecies with her. She says, in a roundabout way, to come back in a day once she has thought about all you have told her. However, you do not actually need to wait a day. Just talk to her again, and she will be ready to give her judgment. It appears you have at least convinced Nibani that you may become the Nerevarine. Your next task, guided by Nibani, is to lift the Seven Curses of Dagoth Ur, walk the path of the Seven Visions, and pass the Seven Trials. The First Trial is simple; you were born on an unknown day to unknown parents. You have also fulfilled the Second Trial by becoming immune to all diseases. For the Third Trial, you must again talk to Sul-Matuul in the camp. Once this trial is fulfilled, return to Nibani for guidance on the remaining trials. Sul-Matuul and the Third Trial[edit] When you ask Sul-Matuul about the Third Trial, he wishes you to first pass a warrior's test by braving the halls of Kogoruhn, an ancient stronghold of the Sixth House. You are to retrieve three tokens from there: Corprus Weepings from a corprus beast, a House Dagoth cup, and the Shadow Shield located in the tomb of Dagoth Morin, deep within the lava tunnels beneath Kogoruhn. If you ask him about Kogoruhn, he will mark its location on your map, southeast of the camp. After completing this mission, Sul-Matuul will disclose the details of the Third Trial to you. Kogoruhn[edit] Kogoruhn is a large structure which is hard to miss and has five different entrances. There is also the corpse of Feril Salmyn on the structure which has some nice Indoril medium armor among other things which could be useful. The Dome of Pollock's Eve, the Dome of Urso, and the Temple of Fey are all small, one-room shrines, each with its own Dagoth. Fey and Urso contain Dagoths Uvil and Reler who are actually quite tough spellcasters, so be careful before you enter these rooms. Pollock has Dagoth Girer, who is not quite as tough as the other two (but no pushover at low levels). The cup and the corprus weepings can both be found in the Dome of Pollock's Eve. The cup is on the table (named as a House Dagoth cup) and the weepings can be found under the urn in the center of the room. You can also find weepings on any random corprus monsters which wander around the other halls. Unfortunately, the Shadow Shield is buried much deeper within Kogoruhn. To reach the shield, you can enter the Hall of the Watchful Touch or the Hall of Phisto sections. Either way, you will need to reach the Bleeding Heart section by passing through the Hall of Phisto, Hall of Maki, Nabith Waterway, Charma's Breath. If you kill Dagoth Ulen (who is actually an ascended sleeper) in the Vault of Aerode, you will get a key to the Nabith Waterway; otherwise you can just pick the lock or use an Open spell. It's quite a walk and there are a number of monsters which you must pass along the way. There is also a good deal of loot along the way, including some ebony weapons and glass armor. The Shadow Shield is lying on a stone near where you encounter Dagoth Elam. There are also some Daedric Gauntlets and an Orc Warhammer in the same area. Once you get all three items, return to Sul-Matuul in the Urshilaku Camp. One item to avoid if you are playing on a pre-1.10 patch version of the game is Fury (found on one of the dead adventurers in the Hall of Maki), as it will cause permanent damage to your armor skills if equipped. (you can fix this by praying at an Imperial Cult Altar or making a Restore Skill spell or potion). Note that you can also enter Kogoruhn from a cave entrance to Charma's Breath near Vemynal inside the ghostfence. This way, you bypass the vast majority of the dungeon. Just be ready to fight the Ash vampire inside. Learn the Third Trial[edit] Sul-Matuul congratulates you on acquiring the three items and rewards you with Malipu-Ataman's Belt. He proceeds to tell you of the Third Trial. The Third Vision states In caverns dark Azura's eye sees/and makes to shine the moon and star. You are to travel to the Cavern of the Incarnate and look for the Moon and Star. The secret of the cavern is set in a riddle: the eye of the needle lies in the teeth of the wind the mouth of the cave lies in the skin of the pearl the dream is the door and the star is the key This riddle is known as Wisdom's Test. You must find the moon and star of the prophecies, and return it to Nibani Maesa. Third Trial Riddle[edit] To solve the riddle, talk to the Ashlanders in the camp as suggested by Matuul. You may need to speak to several people to obtain enough information. If you are carrying Malipu-Ataman's Belt when you speak to them, they will notice it and open up to you. Otherwise you may have to raise their dispositions in order to get information from them. The eye of the needle refers to a tall rock column in the Valley of the Wind. The skin of the pearl refers to a pale rock on the very top of the column. The teeth of the wind refers to Airan's Teeth, two rock spires marking the entrance to the Valley of the Wind. The spires are named after a seer, Airan, who was blessed by Azura. The valley is on the northeast slope of Red Mountain in the center of the island. The mouth to the valley is just east and south of the Daedric Shrine of Zergonipal, which should now be marked on your world map. The last clue refers to the star which is actually Azura's Star that is visible only at dawn and dusk (6-8am and 6-8pm). The riddle tells that a door to the Cave can be found at the base of the needle and will be open only during the dawn and dusk hours. To reach it, start at Falasmaryon and head towards the Daedric Shrine of Zergonipal and just east of it you should find two parallel valleys leading towards the south. Take the one to the east, marked by two tall rock spires (Airan's Teeth). Walk all the way to the end of the valley, and wait for the correct time for the door to open. A quicker and easier way to get there would be to start from Tel Vos and just hike over the mountains to the west. If you go directly west, you should wind up midway through the Valley of the Wind. Simply follow it south the rest of the way. Another quick way is if you have the Propylon Index or the Master Index is to teleport to Rotheran and go due south. Levitation or water walking will help with the first part of this trip. Cavern of the Incarnate[edit] Once you enter the Cavern of the Incarnate, you will see a huge statue of Azura. Pick up the Moon-and-Star in its hands to start a cut-scene. You have now passed the Third Trial and have indeed become the Nerevarine. Don't forget to talk with the ghosts of failed incarnates to obtain some enchanted items (each one has a different phrase that will trigger them to give you the gifts, but usually the phrase is ""my story""). Some aren't particularly useful, but if you don't want to use them you can sell them. Report back to Nibani Maesa and Sul-Matuul[edit] It is not necessary to report back to the Urshilaku, but it makes the Fourth and Fifth Trials a little easier. Speaking to Nibani Maesa will create empty topics in your journal for all of the later quests that will allow you to bypass a little dialogue with the later givers. If you do not have the other Ashlander camps on your map, speaking to Sul-Matuul of those camps will add them to your map. Persecution of the Nerevarine[edit] Once you have received Moon-and-Star, you will be subject to The Persecution of the Nerevarine. Both the Tribunal Temple and House Redoran become your enemies (unless you are already a member of the Temple or the House, then the respective faction will not be hostile) and the other factions don't seem to be pleased either. You will not be able to join the Tribunal Temple and, if you are already a member, you will not be able to finish any quests, or receive new ones. Once you have progressed further in the main quest and/or regained the trust of the Houses and the Temple, this lockout will be lifted. Sul-Matuul will kindly warn you of this before he names you Nerevarine of the Urshilaku, but when he tells you to ""finish your dealings with the Houses and the Temple"", it's actually already too late. The Fourth and Fifth Trials[edit] Your mission now is to be acknowledged by three Great Houses as Hortator (or war leader) and by the four Ashlander tribes as the Nerevarine. These are the Fourth and Fifth Trials, and they can be done in any order or worked on concurrently. Since you're already at the Urshilaku Camp, the Urshilaku Nerevarine quest is the logical first one to complete. After each is complete, you can return to Nibani for more guidance. Bypassing the Fourth and Fifth Trials[edit] If your level is 21 or higher and you have at least 50 Reputation, then you do not have to complete the Fourth and Fifth Trials. Either Nibani Maesa, the Dissident Priests, or the Great House Councilors will tell you that you should see the Archcanon, Tholer Saryoni, in Vivec High Fane right away. This will save a lot of hiking around the various camps and councilors. You can complete these trials anyway, regardless of whether you go to the Archcanon immediately or delay the trip. Doing so will allow you to obtain some rare loot and additional Reputation points. If you do these trials after going to see the Archcanon and receiving the Plan to Defeat Dagoth Ur from Vivec, a few NPCs may express concern that you haven't yet fulfilled the prophecy – haven't faced Dagoth Ur – but that is the only consequence (and a few may repeat that you need to go to the Archcanon despite you already having done so). There is no deadline, and you can put the Main Quest on hold to pursue other aspects of the game, or work on your stats."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Pemenie_and_the_Boots_of_Blinding_Speed","Meet Pemenie on the road northwest of Caldera. (Optional) Escort her to Gnaar Mok.","Pemenie needs an escort[edit] Find the trader Pemenie on the road northwest of Caldera on the way to Ald'ruhn. She will ask you to escort her to Gnaar Mok in return for the Boots of Blinding Speed. Your reward has a flaw[edit] Agree to do so and escort her to Gnaar Mok to the west. Either walk directly there, or if you want to avoid fighting any creatures, simply walk back to Caldera and then fast travel via guild guide to Vivec and take the boat from there, and Pemenie will follow the entire way. Once you enter Gnaar Mok, you will be rewarded with the boots. The boots Fortify Speed by 200 points but also have a 100% Blind spell on them, meaning you'll be fast, but unless you have resisted the effect, you'll have no idea where you're going unless you navigate using the minimap in the corner of your screen. Wearing the Boots[edit] The trick to using the boots is to use a Resist Magicka spell or item before equipping them. If you have 50% Resist Magicka, you'll only be 50% blind, meaning that things will be a bit darker and enemies will be tougher to hit (with weapon skills under 30, you may not be able to hit anything at all). The easiest way to get to 100% Resist Magicka is to buy Cheap Resist Magicka potions from Eris Telas in the High Fane (he restocks it, and also sells to anyone regardless of faction rank or membership). Each potion costs around 15 septims, and can be stacked. This even works for races with Magicka Weakness, like Altmer; you just need to buy more potions. You can also cast a Resist Magicka 100% for a couple of seconds (buy a custom spell or a custom enchanted item) and then equip the Boots of Blinding Speed before the time expires to avoid all negative repercussions. Since the spell has such a short time of effect it will be relatively reliable and easy to cast. If however, you are already suffering from Weakness to Magicka, you will be unable to do this with just one spell because the Resist Magicka 100% will be counteracted by your Weakness to Magicka. You can still reach 100% resistance by stacking multiple magical effects from different sources (even just identical custom spells with different names will work, although activated enchanted items may be more effective due to their instant casting.) Night Eye will brighten your vision and help counteract the blinding effect if it cannot be resisted 100%. The Cuirass of the Savior's Hide is very useful with the boots, as it gives you 60% resist magicka. Bretons have a racial ability of 50% resist Magicka, so a Breton equipping the boots will only get a 50% Blind effect, which is quite bearable. If you don't have 100% magicka resistance when equipping the boots, you can simply adjust the brightness of the game in the video options to see better, but a partial Blind will still have a negative effect on your ability to hit enemies. While wearing the boots, a weak 1 point Levitate (as provided by e.g. the Wizard's Staff) will make you fly at a comfortable speed. Beware that the boots have very low durability. If they are broken in a fight, they will be unequipped and you will be slow again."

Return to Tharer to complete the quest.","Duties[edit] Tharer Rotheloth in the Molag Mar Tribunal Temple asks you to make the Pilgrimage to Mount Kand shrine. Tharer gives you four Quality Potions of Night-Eye and warns you that you should be good with riddles or find The Yellow Book of Riddles (found randomly at many booksellers like the one in Balmora). Mount Kand should now be marked on your map and is northwest of Molag Mar. Mount Kand Shrine[edit] The Flame Atronach The entrance to the shrine is at the top of the mountain and is simply labeled Mount Kand, Cavern (not the Assu cave entrance, which is nearby). Inside you will encounter a Flame Atronach, which you should not attack but talk to (if you attack and kill it you will have to wait until it respawns which can be a few days). The riddle you receive is: A metal neither black nor red As heavy as man's golden greed What you do to stay ahead With friend or arrow or steed The choices to answer this riddle are: Ebony, Glass, Daedric, Lead and Iron, with the relatively obvious correct choice of lead. If you answer incorrectly you will have to kill the creature and wait until it respawns. The Frost Atronach Continue on to find a Frost Atronach on a frozen pool who again offers you a riddle: If you lie to me I will slay you with my sword. If you tell me the truth, I will slay you with a spell. If you answer that the atronach will kill you with a spell, he will demonstrate that it is indeed the truth by attacking you. If, instead, you say he will slay you with a sword, he is caught in a paradox: unable to prove your statement true (by attacking you with a sword, since he will only do that if you lie to him) or false (by attacking you with a spell, since he will only do that if you tell the truth to him), he can do neither, and therefore must let you pass. The Storm Atronach Continue on to find a Storm Atronach offering the longer riddle: My fellow Atronach, Zedias-soko, was slain. The Altmer claims the Dunmer is guilty. The Dunmer says the Khajiit did it. The Orc swears he didn't kill Zedias-soko. The Khajiit says the Dunmer is lying. If only one of these speaks the truth, who killed Zedias-soko? If the Dunmer is telling the truth, then the Khajiit is lying, but if the Khajiit is telling the truth, then the Dunmer is lying. Either the Dunmer or the Khajiit is telling the truth, and since only one of these suspects speaks the truth, then all the others are lying. This confirms that both the Altmer and Orc are lying, which means the Orc is the murderer. The answer to this riddle is that the Orc did it. Continue past the Storm Atronach to the shrine to finish your pilgrimage. Activate the shrine to receive a Reputation point and a blessing: Mount Kand Shrine   - Fortify Endurance 10 pts for 48 mins on Touch, Fortify Intelligence 10 pts for 48 mins on Touch.

If you don't have muck, proceed south into the lake until you come across a small island where you can obtain some from a Muckspunge. Once you activate the shrine, you will be blessed with Feather 100 pts for 48 min. The Shrine to Stop the Moon (Grace of Daring) Grace of Daring, Vivec Temple[edit] The Shrine of Daring, a.k.a. the Shrine to Stop the Moon, is one of three shrines in Vivec, found outside in the southwest corner of the Temple Canton. To activate the shrine, you will need a Rising Force Potion, which can be bought from Danso Indules in the Temple tunnel or from other vendors around Vivec (any quality of potion will do, though you cannot use one you made yourself). Once you activate the shrine, you will be blessed with Levitate 100 pts for 24 min. You can receive this high-speed, long-lasting levitation again and again by returning to donate another potion; this is useful for map exploration and semi-fast travel, e.g. to Daedric and Dwemer sites in the Ascadian Isles. Grace of Generosity, Palace of Vivec[edit] The Shrine of Generosity is one of three shrines in Vivec, found outside the entrance to the Palace. With a donation of 100 gold you can activate the shrine and be blessed with Fortify Mercantile and Luck 10 pts for 48 min. Grace of Courtesy, The Puzzle Canal[edit] The Shrine of Courtesy is one of the three shrines in Vivec and its entrance can be found on Level 3 of the Puzzle Canal in the Palace Canton (in the center of the level in the tunnel). Once inside you will find a shrine that will only give you the cryptic message of Breathe the Waters of His Glory and the Way is Made Clear. To ""breathe the waters"", you must stay underwater until your Breath Bar is depleted, at which point your health will begin to decrease; when your health drops below 10, you will black out for a second and be healed (If you are unable to drown because you have a permanent Water Breathing effect, damage your health to 10 while underwater, or unequip the item providing the effect). Once healed, resurface and head back up the steps and you will find there is now a bridge to a new part of the room. Cross the bridge to the revealed area and talk to the Dremora Krazzt at the top of the stairs beside the shrine. You MUST take a silver long sword out of the chest beside him. That delivers a message about ""you having given"" a sword to the daedra. After that, you MUST talk to the daedra about that sword you TOOK a moment before from the chest. ONLY THEN you get a dialog option with the daedra. Give him the Silver Longsword via the dialog option. You can now activate the shrine and be blessed with Water Breathing and Swift Swim 25 pts for 48 min. The Ash Mask inside the Temple Grace of Justice, Gnisis[edit] The Shrine of Justice, a.k.a. the Shrine of the Mask, can be found at the top of the Tribunal Temple in Gnisis, next to the Mask of Vivec artifact. You need a Potion of Cure Common Disease to activate the shrine, which can be bought within the Temple (check the rooms near the entrance). Once you activate the shrine, try touching the middle panel again to reveal the true Vivec Ashmask. Touch the mask to be taught the spell Vivec's Touch (cheap but 100% effective Cure Common and Blight Disease on Touch). If you are born under the atronach birthsign, touching the true Vivec Ashmask can be an infinite, though tedious, source of magicka. Grace of Valor, Koal Cave[edit] The Shrine of Valor is a little more difficult to reach, being found inside the Koal Cave just south of Gnisis along the shore (it is marked on your map, under the stone arch). You will need some Dreugh Wax to activate the shrine just inside the entrance. You can buy wax in the Gnisis Temple, or just find and kill the Dreugh Warlord found further inside the cave (the Warlord might be very tough for lower level characters). Activate the shrine to receive the blessing of Fortify Unarmored, Light Armor, Medium Armor, Heavy Armor 10 pts for 48 min. If you have killed the Dreugh Warlord in the cave, you'll also receive an enchanted Dreugh Cuirass. The shrine inside the Ghostfence Grace of Pride, Ghostfence[edit] The Shrine of Pride is the most difficult shrine to visit, mainly due to its remote location. You might want to pick up a Petty Soul Gem before you head out since you need a soul gem to activate the shrine. Any type of soul gem, filled or not, will be acceptable. Head towards the Ghostgate, which should be marked on your map, by traveling roughly southeast of Ald'ruhn or taking a long walk northwards through Foyada Mamaea. Once you reach the Ghostgate, look for the pillars with switches on their sides. You will need to activate two switches to be able to pass northwards through the tunnel. Once inside the Ghostfence, travel north a few paces and then follow the path northeast. You will find the shrine at the end, in the little dip between two trees. Activate the shrine with a soul gem to receive a blessing of Fortify Magicka 50 pts and Shield 25 pts for 48 min. One note of warning: The shrine here will take one of each type of soul gem you have, which might be distressing if you were saving them for your next visit to an enchanter. However, you can prevent this happening by dropping all but the cheapest gem before activating the shrine.  It will not, thankfully, take Azura's Star. Also, in the temple accessed from the two Ghostgate towers, you will find numerous shrines that provide various stat buffs, if you are low-level and uneasy about going inside the Ghostfence, where you may encounter Ash and Corprus Creatures, even not far inside the gate. Completion[edit] Once you visit and activate all seven shrines, return to any Tribunal Temple Master (not necessarily the quest givers) to notify them that you've finished the pilgrimages, selecting the ""Seven Graces"" conversation topic."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Pledge_from_Canctunian_Ponius","Talk to Iulus Truptor at the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart for a new almoner mission. Go to the East Empire Company and talk to Canctunian Ponius to retrieve a pledged donation. Canctunian Ponius will instead ask you to track down 3,000 gold of money embezzled from by a clerk, Mossanon. Talk to Shazgob gra-Luzgan to learn that the clerk had been seen using the Guild Guide in the Foreign Quarter. Speak with Flacassia Fauseius in Vivec. Ask around the Sadrith Mora Mages Guild about Mossanon. Talk to any Dark Elf females in Sadrith Mora about Mossanon and find out that he is seeing Volmyni Dral. Find Mossanon in Dral's house and persuade him to return the money. Come back to Canctunian Ponius with the money to receive his pledge. Return to Iulus Truptor to complete the quest.","Almoner Mission[edit] Iulus Truptor at the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart will ask you to collect another promised pledge of 1,000 gold from Canctunian Ponius of the East Empire Company (in his office at the company hall). Pledge from Canctunian Ponius[edit] When you ask Canctunian Ponius about his pledge, he'll instead ask you to track down 3,000 gold of money embezzled from the treasury by the clerk Mossanon. Once you recover this money, Canctunian Ponius says he'll pay his pledge. Start right off by asking around the hall about Mossanon and you'll soon talk to Shazgob gra-Luzgan, who will tell you that the clerk had been seen using the Mages Guild Guild Guide in the Vivec guild hall. Okan-Shei in the hall will further tell you that this is because Mossanon has a Telvanni girlfriend. In Search of the Clerk[edit] Travel to the Mages Guild in Vivec and speak with Flacassia Fauseius, who will tell you that Mossanon has traveled frequently to Sadrith Mora, as should you. Many members of the guild there will direct you to a High Elf trader named Sinyaramen at the Gateway Inn in town. Sinyaramen cannot help you but suggests you talk to Dark Elf females if you want info on a Telvanni with a High Elf boyfriend. Confused yet? Alternatively, you can speak to the Sadrith Mora guild guide, Iniel, who will direct you to Volmyni Dral. If you talk to Iniel or any Dark Elf females in Sadrith Mora about Mossanon, they should report having seen a High Elf in the company of Volmyni Dral, who lives near Wolverine Hall in town. Find and enter Dral's house; you'll find Mossanon upstairs. He explains that he did it to impress his girl, but now he knows she doesn't care whether he is rich. If your Speechcraft skill is high enough and his disposition towards you is favorable, he'll trust you and offer to return it on the condition that you don't reveal where he is. At this point you have three options: Promise secrecy: he'll give you 2,500 of it (he spent the rest) and thank you for your help. Demand the gold: if his disposition is high enough, he'll hand it over and beg for mercy. Consider his offer: he'll say goodbye. Nothing will happen other than a journal update, when you talk to him again you'll still have the same three options. Return the Money[edit] If you want to keep the gold, simply return to Iulus Truptor. To do the right thing, return to Canctunian Ponius in the East Empire Company Hall in Ebonheart with the news. You have the option of returning all or only a part of the money, since he has no way of knowing how much you actually recovered. If you got Mossanon's disposition up to have him hand over the money without making any promises then you have the option to tell Canctunian that you found the thief. You can reveal his location or not as you choose. If you do wish to tattle, or just let Canctunian know that you found Mossanon, be sure to talk to him about Mossanon before Embezzled Funds. Once the money is handed over, Canctunian Ponius considers the Mossanon matter closed. Return to Iulus Truptor with the money to receive the Zenithar Whispers, an amulet that casts charm. This is the last almoner mission he has for you. If your rank is high enough he'll say he's given your name to the Oracle, and that you should consider taking some quests from her directly."

Return to Edwinna to receive your reward.","Duties[edit] It seems that Edwinna Elbert in the Ald'ruhn Guild of Mages is waiting for a Potion of Detect Creatures from Skink-in-Tree's-Shade in the Sadrith Mora Mage's Guild. Edwinna needs you to go to Sadrith Mora and check on Skink-in-Tree's-Shade's progress for her. Potion Delivery[edit] To do this, you need to travel to Sadrith Mora. The quickest and by far the most convenient method is to grab a Guild Guide over to the Sadrith Mora hall. When you arrive, chat with Skink-in-Tree's-Shade about Detect Creatures Potion and Skink will gladly retrieve it for you. In addition, Skink will increase his Disposition toward you by 5 points, and tells you to come see him when you return for some duties. Return to Ald'ruhn[edit] Return to Ald'ruhn to Edwinna. Upon providing the potion to Edwinna you are rewarded with a 10 point increase in Disposition and an Exclusive Potion of Shadow."

Deliver the recipe to Tusamircil at the Mages Guild. Return to Big Helende to complete the quest.","Job[edit] Big Helende at Dirty Muriel's Cornerclub in Wolverine Hall asks you to steal a Dispel Potion Formula from Anis Seloth, the alchemist in town. When you get the recipe, deliver it straight to Tusamircil in Wolverine Hall. Potion Recipe[edit] Anis Seloth can be found on the north side of town. The recipe is in a crate under a plant upstairs (where there are no witnesses fortunately). Tusamircil can be found at the Mage's Guild in Wolverine Hall (the only castle in Sadrith Mora). When you enter Wolverine Hall, look for a stairwell which leads up to a door marked Imperial Shrine, enter this door. Once inside, enter the door on your left marked Wolverine Hall. Proceed up the stairwell and enter the first door you see - Mage's Guild. Give the recipe to Tusamircil. After that, return to Big Helende to finish the quest. Note: If you purchase/steal 4 pieces of Raw Ebony you'll position yourself in the ""Wizard For Hire"" quest to finish very quickly - that quest comes shortly after."

Once this is done, speak with Mevure Hlen at the Tailors and Dyers Hall on the St. Olms Waistworks level who wants to know how the East Empire Company in Ebonheart sets its prices. The Price List[edit] You'll have to return to Ebonheart to seek the letter's contents. J'Zhirr has placed the letter that you seek in a locked chest behind a locked door near where he stands. Unfortunately, this room is well guarded so take your chances and pick the lock, and pay the resulting fine if you are caught (or just kill everyone if that's your thing), or use a chameleon spell to help conceal you.

Search for the Pudai Egg Mine west of Mzuleft. Obtain the seven Golden Eggs in the mine. Return to Hrundi.","The Orders[edit] Hrundi in the Wolverine Hall Fighter's Guild asks you recover the Seven Eggs of Gold from the legendary Pudai Egg Mine. The mine is believed to be somewhere on or near the island of Sheogorad (the large island in the north area of the map) but that's all the information he has. Looking for the Mine[edit] The Pudai Egg Mine is on the main island of the Sheogorad region. It is to the far west of Mzuleft, past the inlet (Mzuleft is to the southwest of Dagon Fel). No one on the island knows where the mine is, so there's no use asking around. To find the Pudai Egg Mine, leave the guild and take a boat to Dagon Fel. Exit Dagon Fel to the west. Go south when the path splits. At the next split, go west (passing an Orc named Bulak gra-Murug). Continue west past a few more forks in the road, and the mine will be on the right. If the path ends in water, turn around and walk back east and look to the left; the mine will be very close. Picking up the Eggs[edit] There's nothing of interest in the main section of the mine. The Golden Eggs can be found behind the queen in the Queen's Lair (each egg weighs 30 units). Return to Hrundi for a reward of 10,000 gold."

Several NPCs possess an amulet - see the list on the right - including Ralen Hlaalo in Hlaalo Manor, Balmora. Being dead, he won't mind it being taken. Finding the ingredients[edit] The four ingredients are slightly easier to get by visiting Telvanni and Mages Guild alchemy vendors. You may have to visit several to find them all. The skull can be found in a great number of places if you just look for one, including the Caldera Mages Guild, or outside the Arano Ancestral Tomb near Tel Branora.

Visit Fatleg's Drop Off to find Ra'Zhid. Recover the artifacts. Return to Sugar-Lips Habasi to complete the quest and receive your reward.","Job[edit] Sugar-Lips Habasi in the South Wall Cornerclub in Balmora asks you to recover some Dwemer artifacts stolen by Ra'Zhid in Hla Oad (southwest of Balmora on the coast). Find Ra'Zhid[edit] It's a moderate walk from Balmora to Hla Oad through some fairly rugged terrain. Alternatively, you can travel to a port city with a dock (e.g. you can take the Silt Strider to Vivec), and take a transport ship to Hla Oad. Ask around town, and you will be directed to Fatleg's Drop Off, where Ra'Zhid can be found loitering inside. Chat with Ra'Zhid, and he'll play dumb about the artifacts in question, claiming that he hasn't received them yet. Speaking with Ra'Zhid leads nowhere, no matter how much you attempt to persuade him. As is often the case, though, he can be taunted into attacking you fairly easily, removing (some) legal complications. Recover the Artifacts[edit] The artifacts are a Dwemer goblet, bowl and tube. Note that you can return any items that you find (e.g., from any Dwemer ruin, not just the ones in Hla Oad). However, the goblet must have a weight of four units (there is one that weighs three units, and it will not be accepted). The artifacts are in a locked (35) chest behind three barrels left of the front door and Ra'Zhid will likely attack you if he notices you attempting to open it or taking the items. Ra'Zhid has a key to the chest on his person, and you can attempt to pickpocket the key from him.  Even if you taunt Ra'Zhid into attacking you and you subsequently kill him in the battle, the owner of the store, Trasteve, will still report you for robbery if he sees you trying to open the chest, with or without the key that Ra'Zhid is carrying. Conveniently, there is a pillar in the house situated directly between the chest and Trasteve that can block his view of you.

Evidently the actual slave is not important, but what she carries is... illegal drugs of some form. Along the way to Balmora, you can talk to Rabinna (if you raise her disposition to 50) to determine that you have a choice of what happens in the quest. If you decide to deliver Rabinna to Vorar Helas on the east side of Balmora, he will attack Rabinna immediately (to get the drugs). Once she is dead, you can talk to him to receive a reward of 400 gold and a magic ring. If Rabinna dies on the trip and you rescue the Moon Sugar and deliver that to Vorar Helas, you'll just get 200 gold and no ring. Alternatively, you can help Rabinna kill Vorar Helas (or just avoid him entirely), and deliver her to Im-Kilaya at the Argonian Mission in Ebonheart. The easiest way is to hop on the boat in Hla Oad. Once you have delivered her to the Argonian Mission, you can talk to Im-Kilaya to receive a 400 gold reward and a 10 point boost in disposition with the Twin Lamps. Finally, you can speak with Relam Arinith after freeing Rabinna. If Vorar Helas is dead, he will consider the matter resolved. If Vorar Helas is still alive, then Relam Arinith will attack you."

Good Redorans will undoubtedly hunt down and kill every bandit therein in revenge. Report back to Sarano with the four shields to complete the quest.

Hlormar Wine-Sot will tell the tale of being seduced by a witch, paralyzed, and robbed of his prized Cloudcleaver axe, and almost all of his clothes. Find the Witch[edit] Hlormar will say that he believes the witch's camp is towards the northwest. Escort Hlormar and follow the road to the northwest, taking the north path at the first intersection. (Strangely enough, she is located not too far away from another witch-troubled barbarian). Find the Witch, Sosia Caristiana, who will tell a different tale. Sosia says that she hired Hlormar as an escort but he became too friendly so she cast a sleep spell on him and took his possessions as a lesson. She believes Hlormar is too angry and decides that she will not give the axe back yet, instead offering that she will meet with Hlormar in three days at the Caldera Mages Guild and give the axe back then. Talk to Hlormar about this offer and he will reject it, forcing you to choose a side in the conflict. Whom to Help?[edit] If you side with Sosia, Hlormar will attack and you will have to kill him. Hlormar is a bare-handed fighter who can quickly knock an unprepared hero with insufficient Fatigue to the ground. Once he is defeated, Sosia will thank you and give you some potions for your troubles (Exclusive Restore Health, Quality Restore Fatigue and Quality Fortify Health). If you side with Hlormar, he will attack Sosia and you can join in to kill her. Note that Sosia attacks with a Steel Staff of Chastening, which damages personality and luck attributes. Loot the axe from her corpse, along with the staff and the potions she'd have given you if you took her side, and Hlormar will notice immediately, giving you the option of giving Cloudcleaver back to Hlormar or not: If you keep the axe for yourself, Hlormar will attack you as mentioned above. If you give Hlormar the axe, he will be happy and offer you some fighting tips that will increase your strength attribute by 2 points. A potential suggestion is to have him raise your strength and then attack him to retrieve Cloudcleaver, thus getting both an increase in strength and Cloudcleaver. You may also pickpocket it from him."

Ask Aryon and he will mention a possible candidate in Balmora. Your Future Mouth[edit] Keep asking around the Telvanni to yield the name Edd Theman (also known as Fast Eddie and Eddie the Rat). Raven Omayn and Enar Releth in the Telvanni Council House in Sadrith Mora will give it to you. If you have already completed the Sixth House Base quest, you can speak with Caius Cosades in his house in northeast Balmora to learn more about Theman. He was a former Telvanni wizard who joined the Mages Guild. Edd is apparently colorful but unreliable, although he is a good source for House Telvanni gossip. Finding Fast Eddie[edit] Edd's house is a little difficult to find, since it doesn't show up on your map. It's on the west side of the river, above Itan's house (near the Eight Plates). The icon on the map will only show Itan's house. Fast Eddie will agree to serve as your Mouth in return for a Silver Staff of Peace. If you still have the one Aryon gave you, you can give that to him. Otherwise you will need to buy a new one.

Convince Bereloth to join the Mages Guild, or kill him. Return to Athrys to complete the quest.","Duties[edit] This is one of the first quests offered by Ranis Athrys in the Balmora Guild of Mages once you reach the rank of Journeyman. This and the quest Manwe's Dues are offered at the same time, but are considered separate and will each raise your standing within the Guild. Ranis will ask you to recruit a Telvanni named Llarar Bereloth in Sulipund. Unfortunately, if you cannot convince him, you must kill him. Traveling to Sulipund[edit] Ranis tells you that Sulipund is north of the Dunmer stronghold Marandus, and she marks Marandus on the map. If you have the Master Propylon Index, use the guild guide to Caldera and have Folms Mirel send you straight there. Otherwise, it's more complicated. The overland route doesn't really have a clear path due to mountains that complicate travel. Without levitation, the trip is very difficult, and far from Balmora. The other option is to take a silt strider to Suran, and then swim up the river that runs beside the town to Lake Nabia. Besides the occasional slaughterfish coming from the deep and the occasional cliff racer coming from above, there shouldn't be that much of a problem with creatures. Once you arrive in the lake, just get out on the shore and you'll be very close to Marandus. Then, just follow Ranis' directions to get to Sulipund. Llarar Bereloth[edit] Once you're inside Sulipund, just follow the winding hallway until you meet up with Llarar Bereloth. Talk to him, and at first he'll refuse to join the Mages Guild. At this point, you have three options, you can either kill him, use your Speechcraft skill to increase his disposition, or bribe him. Once his disposition is at 70, he'll join the Guild. Whether he's dead or has consented to join the Mages Guild, head back to Balmora and report to Ranis Athrys. If you were forced to kill him you will receive the lower Disposition award, and only two potions, rather than four."

Redas Ancestral Tomb[edit] The tomb is just south of Molag Mar. You will need to go around the mountains or levitate over them to reach the tomb. The three items to be retrieved are in two places. The robe and chalice are close to the entrance, while the axe is in the last room and requires that you swim through a pool. Make sure to bring an enchanted or refined weapon, as the tomb is occupied by several leveled Daedra. Return to Retheran in Vivec and give her the three items to complete the quest."

Return to Helende to complete the quest.","The Background[edit] Fara, owner of Fara's Hole in the Wall in Sadrith Mora and Dinara Othrelas of Ald'ruhn have an annual cookery contest and it seems Fara wants an edge this year. Big Helende at Dirty Muriel's Cornerclub in Wolverine Hall asks you to steal the book Redoran Cooking Secrets from Dinara Othrelas at the Llethri Manor in Ald'ruhn, Manor District. Stealing the Redoran Cookbook[edit] The book can be found in Dinara's bedroom in the Private Quarters of the Manor (northernmost bedroom), in a locked chest (50). There's no one around so it's a simple matter to steal the book. You can also receive the book by raising Dinara's disposition to 95 or higher and then asking her to give it to you (she's near the entrance). A Recipe For Success[edit] You can either take the cookbook directly to Fara or return to Helende instead. If you go straight to Helende she will reward you with a Quality Potion of Shadow. Either choice gives you the faction reputation and disposition rewards."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Redoran_Hortator","Talk to Athyn Sarethi in Sarethi Manor (Ald'ruhn, Manor District) to learn about the House Redoran council members. If not a House member, rescue Sarethi's son, Varvur, in Venim Manor, to get his vote for Hortator. Talk to Miner Arobar in Arobar Manor and get his vote for Hortator. Talk to Garisa Llethri in Llethri Manor and get his vote for Hortator. Talk to Hlaren Ramoran in Ramoran Manor and get his vote for Hortator. Talk to Mistress Brara Morvayn in the Redoran Council Hall and get her vote for Hortator. Challenge Bolvyn Venim in Venim Manor to a duel, meeting him in Vivec's Arena. Return to Athyn Sarethi and be named the Hortator for House Redoran.","Overview[edit] You have just officially become the Nerevarine and must be acknowledged as the war leader by the four Ashlander tribes (Ahemmusa, Zainab, Urshilaku, and Erabenimsun) and the three Great Houses (Hlaalu, Redoran, and Telvanni). The first step is to become Hortator to the three Great Houses and complete the Fourth Trial, starting with House Redoran (though the actual order of the houses is unimportant). The quest has two different paths, one for members of House Redoran, and one for those who are not. Sarethi Manor[edit] Pay a visit to Athyn Sarethi in the Sarethi Manor in Ald'ruhn (Manor District). If you are a member of House Redoran (but not the Archmaster), Athyn should tell you that all but one council member will support you as Hortator, Bolvyn Venim. If you are the Archmaster, Athyn will make you Hortator immediately. If you're not a member, you'll have to persuade him significantly in order to get him to speak with you. Even then, Athyn will ask you a favor first: to rescue his son Varvur Sarethi from the Venim Manor (first manor on the right in the Manor District). You must be careful when rescuing him not to kill the councilman Bolvyn as the other council members will turn against you. Rescuing Varvur Sarethi[edit] To find Varvur, find the Right Wing of the Venim Manor. In the large room, on a bench, you should find a 'Note to Malsa Ules' and a key. The note says that ""a guest"" is being held in a hidden room behind the tapestry. You'll find the door and tapestry nearby, and the key on the note opens that door (50 level lock). Remember the nearby guards won't like it if you take the key or note. Once you find Varvur, escort him back to the Sarethi manor and his father. Note that any guards that see him will attack, so planning the fastest route ahead of time might help. You are free to kill the guards, but again be careful not to kill Bolvyn. Once you return Athyn's son, he will give you his vote to be named Redoran Hortator and says that the other council members will concur, except for one. The Other Councilors[edit] From this point, the quest is the same whether you are a House Redoran member or not. Talk to all the councilors in Ald'ruhn in their respective manors: Miner Arobar, Garisa Llethri, Hlaren Ramoran, and Brara Morvayn (see the Red Book of 3E 426, provided by Athyn, for a complete list). Talk to each councilor about the Redoran Hortator and to get their vote. If you are following the Red Book of 3E 426, you will likely visit Morvayn Manor in east Ald'ruhn looking for Remas Morvayn. Unfortunately, he was killed defending the Morvayn Manor from Corprus monsters. His wife Brara Morvayn has taken his seat on the Redoran Council, and you will have to visit her to get the Redoran vote. She can be found in Morvayn Quarters, which can be accessed from the Redoran Council Hall (the door to Morvayn Quarters doesn't appear on the map, since it is directly under the door to Galsa Gindu's House). You will need to duel Bolvyn Venim to the death Bolvyn Venim[edit] The one exception is, of course, Bolvyn Venim, who won't agree with you no matter what. The only option is to have a duel to the death with him to get him out of the way. If you just kill him outright, the other council members will turn against you. Talking with him reveals he wishes to duel you in the Vivec Arena, but he offers a fight only after you have the vote of all the other councilors. If you don't have the votes, his disposition drops by ten points (25 if it was 75+). Take a Guild Guide or Silt Strider over to Vivec, and enter the Arena to find Bolvyn. He is a tough opponent if you attack him in melee as he is heavily armored (ebony) and has a Daedric Dai-katana. He has no ranged weapons or spells however, so feel free to take him out from a distance, but only when standing on the ground floor or within Venim's reach, as spells have been reported to go through his body from the second floor of the Arena. Healing potions and scrolls are helpful of course. Return to Sarethi[edit] Once Bolvyn is out of the way, return to Athyn Sarethi to be named the Redoran Hortator and receive the Ring of the Hortator to identify yourself as such. You also receive a note from the Archcanon saying that should you be named Nerevarine and Hortator of the four tribes and three houses, to present yourself to the Archcanon Saryoni in the High Fane of Vivec. Hold onto this note as you'll need it later."

Stealing the Redoran Master Helm[edit] Arobar Manor is on the right side of the Manor District next to the Redoran Council Hall. The helm is in the Manor Bedrooms, (from the entrance through the Guard Quarters, into the Private Quarters, and onto the Manor Bedrooms, Left Bedroom). The helm is found on top of a closet next to Miner Arobar, so you'll need to sneak in order to get it. If for whatever reason you have trouble stealing the helm because you get caught, it might help if you jump from the bed on top of the closet. This will ensure you are as hidden as possible. To take further advantage of this method, walk near the nearby NPCs and get them to speak to you, then when they're looking at you, move swiftly and position yourself where you would like them to be facing. Note: this only works for a limited time, after which the NPC will change the direction they are looking in. Return to Aengoth with the helm for a reward of 1,000 gold."

It is also possible to turn into a werewolf (Bloodmoon expansion only), though any witnesses to the transformation will immediately report it to a guard, even if the witness is killed. If the quest is pursued in a straightforward manner by outright attacking a boss, then all of the other thieves in the general vicinity will become hostile.

Siding with Odral[edit] If you choose to help Odral, or simply don't see a problem with killing people over a 50 gold debt, simply head out to the farms. Neither of the two farmers have the money to pay the rent, but when you speak to Llovyn, you are given the option of taking his Guar, Corky. While this isn't a strictly monetary amount, taking Corky to Drulene Falen's Guar herd at Drulene Falen's Hut allows you to sell him for 200 gold, which covers both farmers' debt. You can also simply kill the farmers. Siding with the farmers[edit] If you feel something is wrong with killing the farmers, speak to either Crassius Curio in Vivec or Rovone Arvel. The former will give you 500 gold to clear up the matter, since he believes Helvi just wants the farmers dead. Rovone Arvel will just give you 100 gold to cover the debt. Of course, if you don't wish to do any of this running around, you can simply pay Helvi 100 gold out of your own pocket. Ending the Quest[edit] Simply return to Helvi with 100 gold from any source.

Return to Lalatia Varian to complete the quest.","Oracle's Quest[edit] Once you reach the rank of Acolyte, Lalatia Varian at the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart will ask you to find the legendary Ring of the Wind, which she has seen in a vision. Since this is her first quest she offers, you might need to pledge an oath to serve her first. Rather than offer an exact location, she says that she has ""seen the wind upon a dark elf's hand, the fire gleam on the Dwarf's face, and darkness upon the ring of water and heard no name whispered in the mouth of stone"". Unfortunately, Varian does not offer to translate this riddle for you, and leaves it up to you. However, she gives you two Scrolls of Divine Intervention, two Scrolls of Vigor, and two Scrolls of Vitality for the quest. Decipher Varian's Vision[edit] To decipher Varian's cryptic message, speak with any Scout or Savant Dark Elf (the closest are Llaalam Dredil, on the second floor of the Grand Council Chambers, and Nalasa Sarothren, in the Hlaalu Canton's plaza inside Elven Nations CornerClub, downstairs, in Vivec). Speaking with any of them you'll quickly find that Varian was probably speaking of the cavern of Nammu, on the mainland coast west of Tel Aruhn (which is the closest fast travel point). Jon Hawker Ring in Darkness[edit] Nammu starts out as a typical, but tough, smugglers cave and the ring can be found on Galmis Dren. You can speak with the other person here, Jon Hawker, to learn that he is/was Dren's prisoner and he will accept a Scroll of Divine Intervention for his escape, leaving you with some powerful magic gloves, Zenithar's Warning and Zenithar's Wiles, and a Reputation point (as it turns out, Jon is a manifestation of the god Zenithar).

Gold Kanet/Roland's Tear Roland's Tear[edit] The flowers are identical in appearance to the common Gold Kanet, a dark yellow flower with small, rounded petals (so you'll need to activate the plant and hover over or select the contents to determine if it's a normal Gold Kanet plant or a Roland's Tear variety). Collecting the Samples[edit] The shrine is northeast of Vivec and abounds with Gold Kanet, though the Roland's Tears are more difficult to find. In particular, the Tears grow towards the east side of the ruin, though there are several others scattered about as well.

Frald doubts that Entius can get a fair trial in Vvardenfell as he believes the Ordinators are too prejudiced. He wants you to help escort Entius to the mainland where he can be tried by an Imperial justice instead. Unfortunately, the knight has gone into hiding and Frald has no idea where except that he is somewhere in Vivec. You cannot have a bounty on your head when you do this quest, so be sure to deal with any legal troubles before you begin. Saprius Entius[edit] Start searching for Entius by asking Vivec's Ordinator guards about him. Eventually, you'll hear that an Imperial Knight has been seen in the Arena Canton. Look in the Arena storage area off the Canalworks level and you should find Entius hiding behind the northwestern door in the main room. Unfortunately, as soon as you find Entius, two Ordinator guards arrive and you'll have to kill them with Entius' help. Once the guards are dead, talk to Entius again and have him follow you (assuming you have an escape route planned) and escort him back to the Hawkmoth Fort. One easy way to avoid more Ordinators is to take the trap door to the Arena Underworks and then exit via the underwater gate in the northwest corner of the underworks. This will put you in the river outside the Arena Canton; it's a short swim to the Vivec dock where you can catch a boat to Ebonheart.

Getting the Fork[edit] The hermit, Big Head, is found in his shack, which is on the island Northeast of Ald Redaynia. Though the hermit is indeed mad, he is not dangerous, (and his head is no larger than any other Argonian's) and you can ask him about the Fork and he'll let you take it.

Killing the Netch[edit] Now, off to kill this giant netch (which is also no larger than any other netch) with a large fork... and you wonder why they call Sheogorath the mad one? The trick is that Sheogorath just said you had to kill the netch with it, so just use whatever weapon to beat the netch down and use the Fork to finish it off (much easier in the latest patch that shows the creature's health). An even easier way to do this is to kill the bull netch and then switch to the fork as the death animation plays and before your journal updates.  You can also cast a spell that does damage over time, and draw the fork as it dies. Once you kill the netch, return to the shrine. You'll receive your reward, the Spear of Bitter Mercy."

Apparently, a priest had a dream about the shoes and saw them in the depths of Ald Sotha, a Daedric Shrine northeast of Vivec. The shoes were in a chest behind a statue of Mehrunes Dagon. Llethan warns you that it may be difficult but provides several good potions to help, notably a potion of heroism. Ald Sotha[edit] The shrine is to the northeast of the Vivec Telvanni canton, and can be entered through an entrance along the water. The shrine has three areas with a good number of tough opponents. Most can be encountered one at a time if you are careful, or not at all if you would prefer the stealth method. The shoes are in a locked (50) chest under the statue in the well-guarded Inner Shrine (the mage here has the key if you need it, as well as several Sanguine items). Return to Endryn and give back the shoes."

Talk to the ladies inside and ask for local rumors to hear that one of the ladies' husband has gone missing. Ask Moroni Uvelas, also found in the hall, and you'll find out he's a skooma addict who used to loiter in the Underworks. The Flesh Eater[edit] Go to the Underworks and in one of the connecting tunnels you'll see (or be attacked by) a Corprus Stalker. There is no way to rid him of the disease, so kill him and loot the corpse to find her husband's ring.

Getting to Shurinbaal[edit] The cave is just southwest of Gnaar Mok on the coast. Getting there directly from Ald'ruhn is an impossibility, since no Silt Strider exists in Gnaar Mok, but fast travel can still be done relatively easy if you take a Silt Strider to Khuul, and then charter a boat to Gnaar Mok. From there, just head southwest into the swamp to find Shurinbaal. Dealing with the Smugglers[edit] Once you find the cave, you must kill the two leaders, Daroder Helni and Enjine, but feel free to kill anyone else you find there.

Take a vow of silence and travel to the Sanctus Shrine to perform a silent pilgrimage. Activate the shrine to complete the pilgrimage and lift the vow of silence. Return to Endryn to complete the quest.","Duties[edit] Endryn Llethan at the High Fane in the Vivec, Temple Canton asks you prove your wisdom and patience by performing the pilgrimage to the Sanctus Shrine, west of Dagon Fel. First, you must take a vow of silence and promise not to talk to anyone before you reach the shrine. This means no dialogue with anyone, including bartering, travelling, etc... (though you can deal with the guards if you are charged with a crime); you must make the long trip under your own power. The shrine is on an island west of Dagon Fel and he'll mark it on your map. Silent Pilgrimage[edit] There is no easy way to travel to the shrine since you cannot speak with anyone, ruling out any form of fast travel. However, you have several options available to you: Use Mark and Recall - Delay the pilgrimage, travel to the shrine and use Mark. Return to Llethan to accept the pilgrimage and use Recall. Use Divine and Almsivi Intervention effects to make the journey a little shorter (see Notes). Donate a Rising Force Potion (any quality, just not a self-made potion) at the Shrine to Stop the Moon outside the High Fane.  This will provide you with a day's worth of Levitation, more than enough to make a bee-line straight for the shrine. You can fly high enough that even the Cliff Racers won't bother you. Use the Propylon Chambers, provided you have found enough indices to make the cycle around the strongholds. Note that if you have completed the quest from the Master Index plugin, this technique will only get you as far as Caldera. At that point, you must talk to Folms Mirel to go anywhere else, breaking the vow of silence. Use the Scrolls of Icarian Flight—if you have them—and you could Jump there. The shrine is outside at the top of the island marked on your map. Activate it to complete the pilgrimage and lift the vow of silence. Return to Endryn for your reward of four books: Silence, The Four Suitors of Benitah, 36 Lessons of Vivec, Sermon 9 and Sermon 27, which increase your skill in Illusion, Restoration, Blunt Weapon, and Speechcraft, respectively. If you broke the vow of silence by talking with someone but still visited the shrine, you will still receive credit for completing the pilgrimage, but will not receive the books or reputation reward, and Endryn Llethan's disposition will decrease by 5."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:The_Silver_Bowl","Find Beluelle's Silver bowl in Ulummusa. Travel to Piernette's Farmhouse. Return the bowl to Piernette Beluelle.","The Silver Bowl[edit] This is one of the rare quests that doesn't begin with a person, but with an item. In the smugglers' cave of Ulummusa northwest of Pelagiad, you may come across an ordinary silver bowl named Beluelle's Silver bowl. If you've already found it, you may have suspected it was involved in a quest of some sort, and hopefully have it safely stashed away somewhere. If not, the bowl can be found on top of the chest at the end of the cave. Once you take the bowl, you should receive a journal entry about the bowl's inscription. Although the inscription mentions the East Empire Company, nobody there will give you any information about the bowl or Armond Beluelle. Detective Work[edit] Ask around Pelagiad about the bowl to learn that there is a Piernette Beluelle on a farm to the east. You will be directed to the healer at Fort Pelagiad, Ygfa, for further directions. Return the Bowl to Piernette[edit] The farm is east of Pelagiad, north of Vivec, and southwest of Suran. The bridge leading to the farmhouse which Ygfa mentions in her directions is just north of the silt strider platform at Vivec. Speak with Piernette to learn that the bowl was her husband's and was stolen. Return the bowl to her without asking for any reward to receive a 1-point Mercantile boost. If you acted honorably and returned the bowl, you can talk to people about the bowl in Pelagiad to receive a boost in disposition. Ygfa will also allow you to join the Imperial Cult for free. If you refuse to hand over the bowl, Ygfa's disposition will drop 20 points, and a further 20 if you talk to her again. Other Pelagiad residents' dispositions will drop by ten."

Travel to Mount Kand to recover a Silver Staff of Shaming, which vanished several years ago along with its owner, acolyte Linus Iulus. Find the corpse of Iulus, along with the staff, just west of the Cavern at the top of Mount Kand. Return to Kaye to complete the quest.","Shrine Sergeant Mission[edit] Kaye at the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart will ask you to try and recover a Silver Staff of Shaming, which vanished several years ago along with its owner, acolyte Linus Iulus. The Oracle apparently had a dream in which she saw the staff lying in a land of burning rock in the shadow of the Mountain of Fear, otherwise known as Mount Kand, north of Molag Mar. You are to find the staff and Linus's gear if you can. Kaye will give you a Detect Enchantment Ring to help you find the staff and 100 gold for expenses. The Silver Staff of Shaming[edit] This quest is misleading because the actual location of the staff is the exact opposite of the vision given by the oracle. Your discussions and journal will indicate that you should search in the rising and setting shadows of Mount Kand (i.e., below the peak. Except not really since the only commonality found among the rising and setting shadows of the mountain that would be on opposite ends depending on the orientation of the sun would be the peak itself.)  However, Iulus' corpse and the staff are actually found at the peak, west of the Cavern, behind some rocks. The easiest way to find the corpse is to stand in front of the door to the cavern, cast levitate and look straight up. Fly over the top of the pillar and look down. The corpse should be clearly visible on the little plateau below you. Return to Kaye with the staff to receive a Restoration Shirt. If you also return Linus Iulus' Stendarran Belt and Maran Amulet, you can keep the staff as a reward (note that you'll eventually be given your own belt and amulet, so their loss is only temporary)."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Sixth_House_Base","Receive orders from Caius in Balmora to wipe out a Sixth House base in Gnaar Mok. Visit Raesa Pullia in Buckmoth Legion Fort to receive a report of the scouting party. Travel to Gnaar Mok and talk to the locals to find the location of the Sixth House base. Enter the Ilunibi caverns and fight your way to the shrine. Fight and slay Dagoth Gares. Return to Caius.","Orders from Caius[edit] After your meeting with  Nibani Maesa, return to Caius for your next assignment. He will warn you that the next assignment is very tough and advises you to make sure you're ready for it. Apparently, a Legion patrol stumbled across a Sixth House base near Gnaar Mok. Your orders are to find the base and kill the priest Dagoth Gares. Since Caius doesn't know the exact location of the base, you are to report to Raesa Pullia in Buckmoth Legion Fort. Report from Raesa[edit] Buckmoth Legion Fort is just south of Ald'ruhn and due north of Caldera. The quickest way to get there is to take a Silt Strider or Guild Guide to Ald'ruhn and then cast Divine Intervention or hike south to the fort. Raesa is just inside the main fort interior entrance. She gives you the report on the Sixth House base they discovered. Apparently, out of the original scouting party, only one person returned. He died shortly thereafter from the dreaded Corprus disease, but first mentioned a cavern on the coast named Ilunibi. Though Raesa is not familiar with it, she suggests asking the locals in Gnaar Mok about it. If you haven't been to Gnaar Mok yet, it's on the west coast of the island, southwest of Ald'ruhn. Raesa gives you directions to walk there, but the fastest method is to take the Ald'ruhn Silt Strider to Khuul, then take the local boat to Gnaar Mok. Rumors in Gnaar Mok[edit] Once you get to Gnaar Mok, talk to just about anyone to find out information on the Ilunibi cavern (you will need to raise their disposition to 50 or higher to get the information). You find out that the caverns are located on the north end of the island, on Khartag Point. You should have Khartag Point marked on your map when you ask about it, just a little northwest of the village. You should find the caverns named as Ilunibi, Carcass of the Saint. Ilunibi Caverns[edit] Just inside the entrance to Ilunibi you'll find a very nice little waterfall. It gets much worse just farther in, however.  Most of the monsters are random, but depend on your level: lower-level characters are most likely to encounter Skeletons, Ash Slaves, Ash Zombies and Scamps, higher-level characters more likely to have a chance of seeing Bonewalkers, Ash Ghouls, Ascended Sleepers, Atronachs and Golden Saints.  There's also a fair number of Dreamers around. Once you get into the final section of the caverns, Soul's Rattle, you should encounter Dagoth Gares, a unique Ash Ghoul.  He will initiate conversation with you and you should try and get as much information as you can before you exit: he can tell you some pretty interesting things about the history of Nerevar and Dagoth Ur, at least as seen from Dagoth's insane corrupted perspective. Once you exit the conversation he will immediately attack you. Gares is tough, casts spells, and hits pretty hard, but doesn't take too many big hits before he goes down. When he dies, however, he curses you with Corprus disease. After killing Gares, don't forget to loot the bell chamber nearby as it has some excellent loot (including the Fists of Randagulf). At this point in the Main Quest you'll start seeing several barely dressed Dark Elves standing still on the roads. They call themselves Dreamers and are people who have fallen under the influence of Dagoth Ur's growing powers.  They're the same Dreamers that you may have already been seeing in other Sixth House caves and they will attack on sight. Return to Caius[edit] Once you've finished in the caverns, head back to Caius in Balmora (walk to Caldera, east of Gnaar Mok, and use a Guild Guide, or walk a little farther to Balmora southeast of Gnaar Mok - or simply cast Almsivi Intervention from the cave.)  Upon your return, you will be promoted to Traveller. Caius is concerned that you have corprus, but has been gathering some information of his own and has found someone who is doing research into Corprus Disease with a view to finding a cure: the Telvanni wizard, Divayth Fyr. He suggests you visit Fyr on the grounds that if he can't help you, nobody else can."

Varian will relate to you another strange vision which might reveal the location of the item. She saw a Daedric ruin with a forge of molten stone, sealed by fallen rocks, though the forge can still be accessed through the Halls of the Dead. Varian suggests that you talk to a Dark Elf Scout to find out the meaning of her vision. Varian's Vision[edit] Find any Dark Elf scout, such as Nalasa Sarothren at the Elven Nations Cornerclub in Vivec's Hlaalu Canton. If you you ask about ""sealed Daedric ruin"", Nalasa will suggest that you try the ruins of Anudnabia (east of Sadrith Mora). You can also talk to any Dark Elf Savant, such as Llaalam Dredil at the Grand Council Chambers, who will equate the Halls of the Dead with any Dunmer ancestral tomb. Putting the two together yields that you are looking for an ancestral tomb near to Anudnabia. Skull Crusher[edit] The nearest tomb to Anudnabia (which you cannot actually enter) is actually visible (barely) from the shrine: the Omaren Ancestral Tomb (should be on one of the most eastern islands east of Sadrith Mora). From within the tomb, you can access the shrine and reach the Forgotten Vaults of Anudnabia. Jump onto the anvil to reach the Skull Crusher, which is in a chest suspended over the forge. Return to Lalatia Varian with the warhammer, which you will get to keep.  In addition, if your Blunt Weapon skill is less than 40, you'll receive the magical ring Foe-Grinder. If it is greater than 40 you will receive the less powerful Foe-Quern. This is the last quest you'll receive from Varian."

Stop the Slave Rebellion[edit] Once inside the mine, the rebellious slaves will direct you towards their leader, the Argonian Eleedal-Lei. You can talk to him about the rebellion, in which case he will explain that Therana keeps demanding more and more eggs despite the fact that the mine is empty. He is also shocked by the fact that she just uses them to decorate her tower, rather than eating them. Regardless of whether you hear him out or not, you have only two options. You can kill Eleedal-Lei, in which case you will have to fight your way through the rest of the slaves in order to leave the mine. Alternatively, you can find his slave key and free him. There are three copies of the key, each in a different location: one is held by Therana. Another is on the main level of Tel Branora's Lower Tower, on a table next to a bowl with three Small Kwama Eggs. The third is in a container within the mine, near the Kwama Queen. If you choose to free him, he tells you he will free the rest of the slaves and organize their escape to Black Marsh. Return to Felisa to complete the quest. If you killed Eleedal-Lei, you'll receive a Ring of Fire Storm. If you also killed the rest of the slaves, you'll receive a Ring of Toxic Cloud as well.

She will also ask you to find a fallen Buoyant Armiger named Irer Nervion in the stronghold. Dagoth Tanis[edit] Falasmaryon is northeast of Maar Gan, near the Ghostfence. The Dagoth can be found at the bottom of the stronghold near the altar. Irer Nervion[edit] Before or after (it doesn't matter) killing Dagoth Tanis, you will have to find the body of Irer Nervion, who died fighting the Sixth House cultists, and retrieve his Ancestor Ring. To find him, go to the first room on your right from the main entrance. Return to Retheran in Vivec once you have the Nervion Ancestor Ring and have killed Dagoth Tanis to complete the quest.

Tharer marks the location of Uvirith's Grave on your map (far north of Molag Mar). Galom Daeus can be found roughly west of there. He also gives you three magical items to help you on your task: Veloth's Judgement is a powerful Daedric two-handed hammer, Warden's Ring casts a powerful dispel, and Belt of Balyna's Soothing Balm is for healing. Slay Raxle Berne[edit] Galom Daeus can be a little tricky to find, but keep in mind it is a Dwemer ruin so it is easily spotted from a distance. It is west and slightly south of Uvirith's Grave, which will be marked for you by Tharer. There are six lesser vampires in the entrance area, and three more in the Observatory. Raxle Berne himself can be found upstairs in the Observatory. Be well prepared before you try Raxle as he can be tough for the lower levels. Check a ledge near Raxle for more loot.

Travel is long and can be difficult for lower-level characters, especially as there are random daedra that spawn near to the tower itself. The two closest fast-travel locations are Molag Mar and Sadrith Mora. The route from Molag Mar will result in you encountering more hostile creatures, but the route from Sadrith Mora is longer, and requires swimming.

Travel to the cave, and fight your way through to the last mage, Dreveni Hlaren. Defeat Dreveni Hlaren, and recover the artifact from her corpse. Return the staff to Ajira and she will let you keep it.","The Staff of Magnus[edit] Once you've reached the rank of Warlock, Ajira in the Balmora Guild of Mages will tell you about the Staff of Magnus. In Search of the Staff[edit] The staff is located in the cave of Assu, on the slopes of Mount Kand, northwest of Molag Mar. If you look at your paper map, you'll find Mount Kand in the lower southeastern corner of the island. The quickest route is to grab a Silt Strider from Balmora to Suran and on to Molag Mar, or use a Guild Guide to travel to Wolverine Hall and cast an Almsivi Intervention spell from there. From the Silt Strider, head north. Take the north road on the first intersection (follow the sign to Mount Kand). On the next intersection take the left road (it goes up the mountain). After you pass the entrance to Mount Kand, Cavern look to the right for a small road, which doubles back to go even higher up the mountain. The entrance to Assu can be found at the end of that road. Assu Cave[edit] The caverns are not too large but contain, along with Dreveni Hlaren, a few Daedroth, a Frost Atronach and another mage. Dreveni Hlaren, who can be found in the last cavern, is level 20 and wields the Staff of Magnus and is difficult to take out, especially if she falls in the water. If she falls in the water, and you have water breathing and paralysis spells, swim to the bottom and let her follow you. She'll reach a point where she needs to return for air, so paralyze her here and then swim on top of her so she can't swim up. She won't fight you as she tries to swim up, and eventually she'll just drown. Alternatively, a levitate spell here is of great use. The mage casts several summon type spells and hits for a good amount with the staff. Once she's taken care of, take the staff and look around for various treasures. Once you have the staff, make sure to show it to Ajira so that you will be able to take her last quest, the Warlock's Ring."

Return to Edwinna with the book to complete the quest.","Duties[edit] It seems that Edwinna Elbert at the Ald'ruhn Guild of Mages now wishes, with your assistance, to acquire a book, Chimarvamidium, from a fellow Mages Guild member in Vivec. Chimarvamidium is the sixth volume of Marobar Sul's Ancient Tales of the Dwemer. Evidently Sirilonwe of the Vivec branch has acquired a copy of the book and Edwinna wants you to 'borrow' the book and bring it to her. She warns you that if you are caught stealing you will be expelled from the Guild. Edwinna also provides you with two Scrolls of Ondusi's Unhinging, to use if needed.

Locate the reports in question and return them to Ajira.","The Theft[edit] Ajira in the Balmora Guild of Mages asks you to find her two missing reports on mushrooms and flowers. She is positive that Galbedir stole them (probably in turn for Ajira sabotaging her soul gems). Ajira says that Galbedir has not left the Guild so they must still be somewhere inside. Speaking with Galbedir goes nowhere unless your Disposition with her is at least 70, in which case she will tell you where she hid each report. Talking with other guild members will give clues on where each report can be found.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Stronghold_(Hlaalu)","Build the first phase of your stronghold. Talk to Dondos Driler at the Hlaalu Council Manor in Balmora to start the process. Travel to Ebonheart to receive the construction contract from Duke Vedam Dren. Travel to Vivec to buy the land deed from Baren Alen at the Hlaalu Treasury. Return to Dondos Driler with the deed and contract and the construction will begin. After a few days, talk to Driler again, who will ask you to check on the stronghold progress. Talk to foreman on the Odai Plateau, Durbul gro-Rush, and return to Dondos with the news. The first phase should be finished after a few more days. Build the second phase of your stronghold. Talk to Dondos Driler at the Hlaalu Council Manor in Balmora about the second phase. Cure the kwama queen at Shurdan-Raplay Egg Mine. Recruit some miners from Gnisis and Tel Aruhn for the mine. Return to Dondos to start the construction. The second phase should be finished after a few days. Build the third and last phase of your stronghold. Talk to Dondos Driler at the Hlaalu Council Manor in Balmora about the third phase. Recruit a guard from Balmora Fighters Guild or the Imperial Legion at Moonmoth Legion Fort. Meet with the guard at Rethan Manor and deal with the bandits at Zainsipilu. Return to Dondos to start the construction. The third phase should be finished after a few days.","First Phase[edit] Starting the Process[edit] Once you reach the rank of Kinsman in House Hlaalu, any councilor or quest giver will tell you who to contact to start the construction of your very own stronghold (though you can actually start the process anytime after the rank of Lawman and Crassius Curio has seen you). Talk to Dondos Driler at the Hlaalu Council Manor in Balmora. He says you'll need to get a construction contract and a land deed in order to start the building. Getting the Contract and the Deed[edit] Travel to see Duke Vedam Dren in the Grand Council Chambers in Ebonheart to receive the contract (he'll only ask for a vow to help his people). You can buy the land deed from Baren Alen at the Hlaalu Treasury in Vivec (its base price is 5000 gold and is bought like a regular item, so a high mercantile skill and disposition could lower this significantly). Return to Dondos Driler with the deed and contract and the construction will begin. Checking on the Progress[edit] In a few days, you'll be prompted by an entry in your journal to talk with Driler. He'll provide the directions to your stronghold (the Odai Plateau, south of Balmora, past the Shulk Egg Mine, on the ridge) and ask you to check on its progress. The foreman on site, Durbul gro-Rush, will tell you that work should be finished within the week. Return to Dondos with the news. After a few days, another journal entry will appear to inform you that the first phase of the stronghold has been finished. Second Phase[edit] The blighted Queen Improving Business[edit] Once the first phase of your stronghold is completed, you can return to Dondos in Balmora. He will tell you that you need to improve business near your stronghold by restoring the nearby Shurdan-Raplay Egg Mine, just across the river. You can restore the mine by curing the blighted Kwama Queen and hiring some miners. Curing the Kwama Queen[edit] To cure the queen, simply cast a Cure Blight spell or scroll on her. Dondos says you can purchase scrolls from Hetman Abelmawia in his hut in Gnisis or  Pierlette Rostorard in Sadrith Mora, but you may not have any luck with the latter. You could also get the Vivec's Touch spell from the Vivec Ashmask in the Gnisis temple. The Manor under Construction Recruiting Some Miners[edit] As for the miners, talk to Dondos again and he'll suggest that you recruit some unemployed miners, especially from Redoran territory. You'll really only recruit one, and that would be either Ilasour Tansumiran, found in his cave-dwelling home north of the Temple in Gnisis, or Llaals Ores at the Slave Market of Tel Aruhn. (Llaals at this point in the game is a slave in the Tel Aruhn Underground). If you choose him, talk to Savile Imayn to learn that you'll need to cure the Kwama Queen (if you have not already done so) to secure his release. Whichever miner you chose, return to Dondos afterwards.  You may find that neither miner will actually go to the mine, and will instead remain where you found him, but this will have no effect on the stronghold-construction quest. Some users report that this minor glitch appears to be resolved in the Game of the Year edition.  (If the miner does not arrive and this bothers you, you can use the PositionCell Console command to move him there manually.) Building the Second Phase[edit] Once you've cured the Queen and hired one of the miners, return to Dondos to start the second phase of the stronghold. You should receive another journal entry one week later, when the second phase of construction is complete. Third Phase[edit] Problems with Bandits[edit] Once the second phase of your stronghold is finished, and you've reached the Hlaalu rank of House Father, you can begin the third and final phase of construction. Speak with Dondos again, and he will tell you that you need to get rid of the bandits in the area of your stronghold. To do that, he says you'll need to hire a guard (regardless of your character's prowess), and suggests you seek one at the Balmora Fighters Guild or the Imperial Legion at Moonmoth Legion Fort. Recruiting a Guard[edit] Moonmoth Fort will have no one to spare, but speaking with Flaenia Amiulusus at the Balmora Guild of Fighters will get you a guard named Fjorgeir for 1000 gold. It is only necessary to hire the guard to tell you where the bandit hideout is. If you have already found the hideout on your own, you can simply go straight there and eliminate their leader (or the whole lot), without having to hire the expensive guard. However, you may find him useful, as he will remain a companion, while he lives, whom you can take to other fights (or just station him at your stronghold when you don't need him). Dealing with the Bandits[edit] If you hire Fjorgeir, travel to your stronghold to meet him and talk to him about the bandits. The bandits are hiding out in the cave of Zainsipilu which is southeast of the stronghold. Follow the Odai River south until you come to a wooden bridge, with a nearby sign pointing west to Hla Oad and east to Seyda Neen. Follow the path east toward Seyda Neen, which winds its way between bubbling mud pools. After a short distance, you will find the cave north of the path. Travel there (with or without the guard) and kill the leader of the bandits, Maros Gimayn. Killing the other seven bandits is optional. Building the Third Phase[edit] Return to Driler to begin the third phase of construction. You should receive another Journal entry in three days when the last phase of construction is complete. Congratulations, your very own Manor overlooking the Odai is now ready."

Talk to Hetman Guls again. Return to Galsa to start the construction. The third phase should be finished after a few days.","First Phase[edit] Starting the Process[edit] To start your stronghold once you reach the rank of Kinsman, Athyn Sarethi will direct you to talk with Galsa Gindu at her home in Ald'ruhn's Manor District, Council Hall. She will require a payment of 5,000 gold and a construction contract. The contract can be obtained from Duke Vedam Dren in the Grand Council Chamber in Ebonheart if you promise to aid the people of Vvardenfell. If you have talked to Azura and gotten Moon-and-Star Dren will just give it to you without making you promise as a token of his gratitude. Once you give the money and contract to Galsa, the construction of your stronghold will begin. Checking on the Progress[edit] After four days, you'll receive a journal entry telling you to speak with Galsa again. She tells you to speak to the stronghold foreman and make sure everything is okay. The stronghold is east along the road between Ald'ruhn and Maar Gan. The foreman, Bugdul gro-Kharbush, will tell you that everything is fine and it should be finished within the week. Report back to Galsa and after four days you'll receive another journal entry telling you that the first phase of your stronghold, Indarys Manor, is complete. Second Phase[edit] Recruiting Some Guards[edit] Speak with Galsa Gindu at her home in Ald'ruhn's Manor District again to start the first upgrade of your stronghold after it is initially constructed. She tells you to speak with Percius Mercius at the Fighters Guild in Ald'ruhn to recruit some guards. Rescuing Percius' Friend[edit] Percius agrees to hire you some help, but asks you to first rescue his friend, Frelene Acques, from the prison in the Hlaalu Canton in Vivec. The prison can be reached via the Hlaalu Treasury and you'll have to deal with the guard either before or after you free Acques. Free and escort the prisoner to outside of the treasury where you'll part company. Alternatively, you can just steal the key to her cell from the table and give it to her; she will escape after you leave. The key is easy to steal if you position yourself so the pillar blocks the view of the guard. You can also simply Taunt or Frenzy the Ordinator into attacking, killing him with no bounty. Building the Second Phase[edit] Report back to Percius who will send some men to guard your stronghold and then speak to Galsa to start the second phase of construction. You will receive a journal entry after five days to indicate when it is complete. Third Phase[edit] More Women for your Stronghold[edit] You will not be able to progress your stronghold any further until you return to Athyn Sarethi to receive a promotion to House Father. However, he will not be able to promote you any further until you have won the support of more councilors and built a stronghold fit for a Councilman. Return to Galsa Gindu at her home in Ald'ruhn's Redoran Council Hall to start the third and final upgrade of your stronghold. She will send you to speak with Hetman Guls at your stronghold who will tell you that you need to attract some more settlers, specifically more single women. Just two will do, but you can convince up to four women to move there. Attracting Some Women[edit] There are a number of methods of getting the women: Fathusa Girethi at the Ald Skar Inn and Aryni Orethi outside her house in Ald'ruhn will both agree to come to your village once you persuade them (90 disposition required). You can also buy two slaves for 1,000 gold each from Savile Imayn in Tel Aruhn. Alternatively, Galyn Arvel in Ald Velothi will agree to send escaped slaves to your stronghold (requires Twin Lamps codephrase, which you can get from a slave after freeing 21 slaves). Helviane Desele at her establishment in Suran will tell you that some of her dancers are ready to retire if you persuade her enough (70 disposition). If you do option 2, 3, or 4, the same ladies will show up in your stronghold (Heniele Milielle in Manor Service, and Assimusa Samsi outside), so you'll only be able to do one of those three, plus option 1. You can have four women attend your stronghold this way. Building the Third Phase[edit] Once two or more of these women agree to live in your stronghold speak with Hetman Guls once more.  Then go back to Galsa again to begin the last phase of construction and you will receive the two reputation points reward. You will receive a journal entry after a few days when construction is complete."

The third phase should be finished after a few days.","First Phase[edit] Starting the Process[edit] Once you reach the rank of Mouth you can start the construction of your stronghold by talking with Llunela Hleran in the Telvanni Council House in Sadrith Mora. She will tell you that you need a construction contract from Duke Vedam Dren in the Grand Council Chamber in Ebonheart and that you must collect two strong souls. Getting the Contract and the Souls[edit] Procure a strong soul for Llunela All that Vedam requires is for you to give an oath to aid the people of Vvardenfell for you to receive the contract. If you have already received Moon-and-Star from Azura, he will give it to you without hesitation, for all the noble acts you have done for Morrowind. The best way to get the souls is to summon two of the suggested daedra (Winged Twilight, Storm Atronach or Golden Saint); Galar Rothan in the Telvanni Council House entry has a greater soul gem filled with a storm atronach on his shelf, that you can either buy or steal (he also has one with an ogrim, but that soul will not work for this quest). There is also a filled grand soul gem with a Winged Twilight on the desk of Galbedir in the Balmora mage's guild. Urtiso Faryon in her Sorcerer's store and Nelso Salenim in the Telvanni Council House both sell a Summon Storm Atronach spell if you need one. For those with lower conjuration, a respawning Storm Atronach is located at the bottom of Mount Kand cavern.  Once the two souls gems are filled, return to Hleran to begin the first phase of construction on your stronghold. On the fifth midnight after turning in the soul gems and the contract, you'll receive a journal entry prompting you to speak with Hleran again. (For example, if you turned in the soul gems and contract even as late as 11pm on day 10, you'll receive the journal entry at 12am on day 15.) Warning: She will gladly accept Azura's Star as one of the soul gems, and she will not give it back.  Make sure you store it somewhere before you return to her with the filled soul gems. Checking on the Progress[edit] Hleran will now give you the stronghold's location (Tel Uvirith in the Uvirith's Grave area), northwest of the Erabenimsun Camp, far west-southwest of Sadrith Mora. Speak with the site foreman there, the Orc Gashnakh gra-Mughol, and return to report to Hleran. Construction will be finished on the fifth midnight after you report to Hleran, and you will receive a journal entry to that effect. The first phase does not result in any interior cells. The mushroom is slightly bigger than during the construction phase and the crystals will have disappeared. Second Phase[edit] Once the first phase of construction on your stronghold is complete, you can speak with Hleran again to begin your first upgrade. Hleran will ask you for 5,000 gold and some Dwemer schematics from the ruins of Mzanchend (northwest of your stronghold). Bring the schematics and the gold back to Hleran to start the upgrade construction. You will receive a journal entry on the fifth midnight once construction is complete. The second phase results in two homes and the lower tower. Third Phase[edit] Guards Needed[edit] Once you reach the rank of Master or Magister, speak to Hleran again to begin your second and last upgrade to your tower. She will tell you that guards are needed for your stronghold and that you'll need to find the book Secrets of Dwemer Animunculi, found only in the vampire lair Galom Daeus, to create the guards. Getting the Book[edit] The lair is west-southwest of your tower and it is a dangerous place, as it is home to the Berne Clan of vampires. Retrieve the book and return to Hleran, who will order the final phase of construction to begin (note that when you collect the book you also gain the Dwemer Animunculi spell to summon a Centurion Sphere, the only known way to get it).

The Telvanni Agents[edit] The lookout, whose name is Alveleg, will allow you to approach, and will even chat with you a little; however, if you ask him about Telvanni agents, he'll turn hostile and attack. Eliminate him and then enter Ashanammu to take out the remaining three agents (Alynu Aralen, Sathasa Nerothren and Fothyna Herothran).  They will attack as soon as they see you, and they are grouped together, so be prepared. Once they are dead, return to Eydis Fire-Eye for a faction reputation increase and 400 drakes."

Speak to their leader, Remasa Othril, to learn that her sister has been captured. Kill Milyn Faram and rescue Vedelea Othril. Return to Edryno Arethi.","Business[edit] Edryno Arethi in her house on the Hlaalu Waistworks in Vivec will ask you to help any survivors who are fighting an evil Telvanni mage at Odirniran, east of Molag Mar. The cave entrance is on the same peninsula where the Shrine of Azura is found, west from that location. Travel to Odirniran[edit] If you have completed Mehra Milo and the Lost Prophecies, then you will be able to travel to Holamayan from Ebonheart. From there it is a swim and a reasonable walk to the southwest. If you have not yet completed that quest, the shortest way is to take a boat from Vivec to Molag Mar. Odirniran is due south of Nchurdamz, which Edryno Arethi should have marked on your map, and due west from the Shrine of Azura. It is significantly further from Molag Mar and the terrain is much rougher. Helping the Survivors[edit] There are survivors, a good number of them, and they seem to be doing relatively well for themselves. Speak to their leader, Remasa Othril, and you'll learn that her sister, Vedelea Othril, has been captured by the sorcerer, Milyn Faram. Vedelea can be found in a locked cell (Milyn Faram has the key on him) and will not follow you until the sorcerer, upstairs in the tower, has been killed. Escort Vedelea back to her sister, Remasa Othril. Return to Vivec[edit] Return to Arethi in Vivec to complete the quest and receive a 500 gold reward for killing Faram, and another 500 gold if you successfully rescued Vedelea. You also receive five points of Hlaalu faction reputation and Arethi's disposition increases by 15, with an extra five points of each if you rescued Vedelea."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Telvanni_Hortator","Meet with Master Aryon in Tel Vos (Upper Chamber) to receive an overview of the Telvanni councilors. Get Aryon to vote for you as the Hortator. Convince Mistress Dratha in the Upper Tower in Tel Mora. Convince Master Neloth in Tel Naga (Sadrith Mora). Convince Mistress Therana in the Upper Tower of Tel Branora. Convince Master Baladas in Arvs-Drelen (Gnisis) if necessary. Kill Gothren in the Upper Tower of Tel Aruhn. Return to Master Aryon to be named Hortator of House Telvanni.","Overview[edit] This quest is part of convincing each of the three Great Houses to vote you as their Hortator. The exact order you do the houses in is not important. The House Telvanni portion of the Hortator quests is a bit different since in the end you can ultimately kill all the Telvanni council members instead of persuading them all (as is their custom for resolving disputes). Of course, this route is not the suggested one, but it is possible. In any case, if you are already the Archmagister of House Telvanni, you will become the Hortator as soon as you discuss the topic with Master Aryon. It is highly recommended you acquire some means of levitation before undertaking this quest, as it is needed to reach all of the council members except Master Baladas. Master Aryon[edit] The Mouths in the Telvanni Council Hall will suggest that you first speak to Master Aryon in Tel Vos (just west of Tel Mora and opposite Vos). Aryon can be found in his chambers at the top of the tower, within the root-like structure that wraps around it. The easiest way to reach his door is to levitate; however, if your Acrobatics skill is very high (at or near the cap), you can alternatively climb to the top of the central tower and jump from platform to platform to reach it, or simply head out the back door of the Barracks and Armory and jump directly to it from there. Upon talking to him, he immediately affirms his vote for you being the Hortator. If you are the Archmagister of House Telvanni, this alone is sufficient to make you Hortator; otherwise, he also tells you about the other council members that you must convince to get their votes. Master Neloth is ill-tempered, Mistress Dratha doesn't like men, Mistress Therana is losing her mind and Archmagister Gothren will probably delay his vote indefinitely. Aryon recommends that you kill Gothren, admitting that he stands to gain from the Archmagister's death. He tells you his advice is still good, and, as detailed below, it is. Mistress Dratha[edit] Mistress Dratha is found in the Upper Tower in Tel Mora (just east of Tel Vos). If you're female you'll get her support right away. If you're a man however, you'll need to raise her disposition quite a bit to get her to support you (80 or higher). If you're a man and not a member of House Telvanni you will need to raise her disposition by using your Speechcraft (61 or higher) to persuade her or bribe her with lots of gold, or otherwise kill her. If you can get her disposition high enough, you can Hurl yourself at her feet and plead for a hearing. After you get her vote, she will also throw in four Summon Golden Saint scrolls if your character is female; just one if you are playing a male. Master Neloth[edit] Master Neloth in the Upper Tower at Tel Naga (you will need to levitate to get to it) in Sadrith Mora will give you his vote for Hortator if you raise his disposition high enough (70 or higher). Mistress Therana[edit] Mistress Therana is found in the Upper Tower of Tel Branora, which is on an island at the far southeast corner of the game map (you can reach it by boat from Sadrith Mora, Molag Mar, Ebonheart, and Vivec). Talking with her will cause her to tell a long and irrelevant story. You can interrupt her by amusing her if you have a Speechcraft skill of 30 or higher, or you can successfully interrupt her with a story of your own if her disposition is 80 or higher. All other actions will result in failure. Master Baladas[edit] If you are a member of House Telvanni, but not the Archmagister, and have done the quest to convince Baladas Demnevanni to join the Council, you'll have to ask him for his vote as well. Master Baladas can be found in Arvs-Drelen in Gnisis and will give you his vote if his disposition is 40 or higher. Otherwise you will have to raise his disposition again before he gives you his support. Don't worry if you killed him after persuading him to join the council as the game will treat the situation as if he never joined. Gothren[edit] Gothren can be found in the Upper Tower of Tel Aruhn, just west of Sadrith Mora. Unfortunately, unlike the other council members, no matter what you do to persuade Gothren, he won't give you a decision, forcing you to kill him as Aryon suggested. If you raise his disposition high enough, he will eventually give you a direct refusal. This is no easy battle as Gothren is a master spellcaster and he has two Dremora guarding him. Gothren has a spell called Gothren's Gout that paralyzes while damaging you, so some equipment that resists paralyzation or gear that gives 100% magicka resistance is helpful. If you get a few good surprise hits in with a powerful weapon, or paralyze him, he won't have much time to cast anything. If you have the means, command one of the Dremora protecting Gothren. This way, Gothren will kill it for you while still taking damage himself from his own ally. You can then kill the other Dremora (or take control of it) much more easily before turning fire to Gothren. Alternatively, attacking either of the Dremora flanking him will cause all three to attack you without the other tower residents joining in. Taunting Gothren will have the same result. Becoming Hortator[edit] Any councilor (including Therana) can give you the title of Hortator once all surviving councilors agree, even with Aryon dead. However, to get the Robe of the Hortator you must go to Aryon and tell him you have obtained all the votes - if Aryon is dead, the robe will be in a crate near the entrance to his chambers."

Kill Rels Tenim. Return to Hrundi.","The Orders[edit] Hrundi in the Wolverine Hall Fighter's Guild asks you fulfill the bounty on an outlaw Rels Tenim near Vos (given at the same time as the Berwen's Stalker quest). Finding Tenim[edit] Speak with just about anyone in Vos, which is west of Tel Mora, to find out that the Ahemmusa Tribe might know where he is hiding. The Ahemmusa Camp is directly north of Vos (you visit it during the Main Quest and it might be marked on your map). Speak with anyone in the camp (you may need to persuade them first) to find that Tenim may be in Shallit, on a small island southwest of Ald Daedroth.  Shallit can be tedious to find if you head across the sea from the Ahemmusa, but it is northwest of the camp, on the north side of the small island that is just before you reach the larger island on which are Dagon Fel and multiple ruins (Rotheran, Nchardahrk, Mzuleft).The directions you are given by the Ahemmusa are vague and a bit misleading. The hideout is actually quite a ways west-southwest of Ald Daedroth, and is closer to Dagon Fel, both as the crow flies and in travel time.  Thus, you can spend a few coins and save time by taking a ship to Dagon Fel, then going south-southeast to find Shallit's island; this involves only one short bit of manually crossing water between the two islands. Tenim's Hideout[edit] ""The unwary will find themselves in the clutches of a black fate."" If you run through Shallit quickly, you'll find that Tenim is nowhere to be found, and that the final door in the cave leads into Drethan Ancestral Tomb, inhabited by a spellcasting vampire named Marara—a trap that has been laid for you and any other bounty hunters. In the cavern just after you enter the cave, look up and to the south, and you'll see a hidden ledge (you might notice it on your map as well). You'll need Levitate or strong Jump to get up there, and you should be able to find a potion or two lying around in the lower cave if you don't have the Levitate ability handy. Once up, you'll quickly encounter four of Tenim's generic bandit friends before you meet the well-equipped Tenim himself. There's a good amount of loot to be picked up here (gems mostly) so look around. Return to Hrundi for your 200 gold reward."

Return the invoice to Drarayne Thelas in Balmora to be rewarded with an ""Extra-Comfy Pillow.""","Drarayne's Pillows[edit] This is one of the more obscure quests in the game which takes a bit of luck, and a good memory to discover. On a Fighters Guild quest to kill some rats in the house of Drarayne Thelas, you may have noticed the unusually large number of pillows she keeps. Pillow Shipment[edit] On the other end of the island, far to the north in the Sheogorad Region, you'll find an Abandoned Shipwreck, north of the Sanctus Shrine (far west of Dagon Fel and just north of the Vas stronghold). Inside the cabin you'll find an invoice for 40 pillows addressed to Thelas. While you cannot deliver the pillows, you can give Thelas the invoice and receive an ""Extra-Comfy Pillow"" as a reward (talk to her about a 'Pillow Shipment' when you have the invoice): pillow shipment ""A shipwreck? That's horrible! Oh, all of those wonderful pillows... Well, I thank you, PCName. It is good to know what became of my shipment, though the loss of pillows saddens me. A few of those were stuffed with racer plumes. A real shame. Still, thank you for your help with this. Take this as a token of my appreciation. It has served me well.""

Acquire 26 Sanguine items. Return to Eno to complete the quest.","Map showing locations of all 27 items (click to enlarge) Threads of the Webspinner[edit] Depending on how much exploring of the game you've done, you may have come across a number of Sanguine items that increase various skills when worn. These items are actually part of a collection of 27 created by the Daedra Lord Sanguine for the Morag Tong patron, Mephala. Twenty-six of the items can be found scattered across Vvardenfell - the last, the Amulet of Sanguine Enterprise, is held by the Morag Tong Grandmaster, Eno Hlaalu in Vivec. The Sanguine Items[edit] Speak with Grandmaster Eno Hlaalu about the items and he will tell you that if you return all of the remaining 26, you will receive an elaborate reward from Mephala. You can return the items to Hlaalu at any time, though you must do so before you become Grandmaster of the Morag Tong and he disappears. Most of the Sanguine items are owned by Dark Brotherhood agents and Mehrunes Dagon worshippers who will generally attack you on sight, meaning you are safe from the law. Unfortunately, Eno will only give you the location of two of the items, so you'll have to find the rest yourself.  # Item Skill Owner Location Notes   1   Sanguine Enterprise, Amulet of   Mercantile  Eno Hlaalu  Ascadian Isles, Vivec, Arena canton, Morag Tong Guildhall  This is the one item you don't need to find.   2   Sanguine Glib Speech, Amulet of  Speechcraft  Shotherra  West Gash, Khuul, Thongar's Tradehouse  She is non-hostile, with no clues given that she has the amulet.

You can taunt him to start the fight.   9   Sanguine Fleetness, Belt of  Athletics  Hrordis  Ascadian Isles, Pelagiad, Halfway Tavern  Eno Hlaalu will ask for it directly (one of two Sanguine items he will ask for), if you haven't already gotten it and handed it in to him. Under normal circumstances, you won't be able to persuade Hrordis or steal the belt - or even Taunt her into attacking you, as all she says is ""goodbye"" - so you are forced to kill her outright. However, if you're diseased, a vampire, or naked, you'll be able to talk to her. Mentioning Hrordis or Sanguine Fleetness will get you nowhere (she'll become annoyed and say goodbye), but mention Mehrunes Dagon (if you have the conversation topic) and she'll attack.   10   Sanguine Hewing, Belt of  Long Blade  Durus Marius  Ascadian Isles, Vivec, St. Olms Canton, Assernerairan  He is encountered during the quest Execute Durus Marius.   11   Sanguine Sureflight, Belt of  Marksman   12   Sanguine Impaling Thrus, Belt of [sic]  Spear  Gluronk gra-Shula   Azura's Coast, Sadrith Mora, Gateway Inn  She is non-hostile.

It is possible to pickpocket the Sanguine item from him, though what a Khajiit is doing with shoes in the first place is anyone's guess, since he can't wear them.   27   Sanguine Stalking, Shoes of  Sneak  Thovasi Alen  Ashlands, Assarnatamat  The Daedric shrine where she's located is found northeast of Balmora (southeast of Caldera), just inside the Ashlands region.

She'll warn you to steer clear, but who are you to listen to warnings? Finding Umbra[edit] To find him, exit the tradehouse and face the hills. Use a Levitate spell or potion to ascend them, or if your Acrobatics skill is high enough you could try climbing the pass on foot. You can climb the mountain without levitate or high acrobatics by going up-hill in the southward direction from the tradehouse, left of the arch to the south outside the door of the tradehouse. Jump into the crack between the hill and the side of the temple wall. With some jumping and running up the hill, turning left when possible, you can get up the mountain quickly. There's also a pass around the mountains, but it's difficult to find, and a much longer walk. A way to make the walk more efficient is to find Umbra after you do the Inanius Egg Mine quest, as he is just around the corner from there. You should see Umbra surrounded by a wall or pile of rocks. The Weary Warrior[edit] Speak with him to learn that the Orc is merely tired of life, having killed so many times, and wishes to die a warrior's death in combat. He will fight you if you grant Umbra his wish for a worthy death. Be warned though, Umbra is more powerful than your average opponent. He wears full Orcish armor and his sword packs a considerable punch, but he has no ranged weapons or spells. You might want to attack from a distance or have some healing magic prepared if you aren't well armored and don't care about the Honor aspect. Once you kill him, you get to keep his equipment, including his sword, which goes by the same name as him. When you ask his name, he says that his name doesn't matter, and tells you that, if it makes you feel better, you can call him after his sword."

Speak to Only-He-Stands-There and either: Get him to stop offering training. Accept his deal for a discount. Or just kill him. Return to Ranis Athrys.","Duties[edit] Ranis Athrys at the Guild of Mages in Balmora will ask you to head over to the South Wall Cornerclub and get an Argonian to stop offering unsanctioned training in Restoration. Unsanctioned Training[edit] Once you get to the club, Only-He-Stands-There suggests a deal. If you return to Ranis Athrys, and tell her that he's stopped offering training, he'll train you (prior to this quest, he refuses all services to the player). You can either accept this, kill the Argonian, or use bribes and Speechcraft to get his Disposition high enough so that he'll just stop offering training. If you kill him, you are rewarded with four Scrolls of Elemental Burst:Fire and receive an extra five points of disposition with Ranis. Choose whatever method seems to work for you, and then return to the Mages Guild to speak to Ranis Athrys."

If you choose his Counsel topic he will explain the duties of the Nerevarine. He will also warn you that people of the Great Houses and the Tribunal Temple may be hostile when you are known as the Nerevarine. Therefore, he will give you the option of finishing the  Fourth Trial to become Hortator of the three Houses first, and come back later to become the Urshilaku Nerevarine. If you choose his Urshilaku Nerevarine topic, Sul-Matuul will automatically recognize you as the Nerevarine, War Leader of the tribe. He also gives you the Teeth of the Urshilaku so that you will be recognized as the Nerevarine by other Dunmer. Sul-Matuul will also suggest that you take counsel with Nibani Maesa about the ways of the Ashlander tribes and their ashkhans, for you are an outsider, and unfamiliar with Ashlander ways."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:The_Vampire_Hunter","Speak to Dhaunayne Aundae. Travel to Ald'ruhn and slay Ano Vando in front of witnesses in broad daylight (9 am - before 5 pm). Return to Aundae and receive the Aundae Amulet. Slay twelve vampires. Return to Aundae to receive access to the clan's cattle.","Set an example[edit] The Aundae Clan leader, Dhaunayne Aundae, at the bottom of Ashmelech, will ask you to kill a vampire hunter who has been exploring Ashmelech. Although you are given no name, you are told that the hunter lives in Ald'ruhn. Also, you are told explicitly to kill him in broad daylight with witnesses to provide an example to others. The Vampire Hunter[edit] Travel to Ald'ruhn and ask around the Mages Guild to learn that the hunter is Ano Vando and is actually walking near the Mages Guild carrying an iron mace (the Light of Day) and an ebony shield (the Darksun Shield). Be sure to kill him during the day (between 9am and 5pm). Though Dhaunayne Aundae says you need to be seen, it isn't actually required. When you kill him, you will receive a journal entry saying whether you did it at the right time. Note that although Vando's equipment is quite powerful, don't try to use it while you are a vampire as the items will do continuous scripted damage to you. Attempting to use the shield will display the message: ""You feel a searing pain on your arm as you equip the shield. A voice screams out in your mind, ""This is not for your kind, Dark One."""". Equipping the mace will result in this bit of text: ""Your hand begins to blister and burn with the pain of a thousand suns. A voice echoes in your mind, ""Never shall you wield this, evil thing."""". Return to be rewarded[edit] Return to Dhaunayne when Vando is dead to receive the Aundae Amulet which will Recall you to the clan's headquarters. But wait, there is more[edit] Dhaunayne Aundae will then tell you that you might find further reward if you kill any 12 vampires from the other clans, Quarra or Berne. Any vampire you killed before starting this quest will not count towards this task. Spare Berne and Quarra's lives until the right moment. If you kill any of your own clan during the quest, you will need to kill that many extra from the other clans. There is no journal entry to inform you when you have killed the necessary number of vampries; you will need to keep track of the number of valid kills on your own. Return to Dhaunayne once you've killed 12 vampires to receive permission to use Vampire Touch on the clan's cattle to heal yourself (just don't kill them)."

Slay 12 vampires of the Quarra and Aundae bloodlines.","Raxle has use for you[edit] The Vampire Ancient Raxle Berne, in the Dwemer Observatory Galom Daeus, will ask you to kill the vampire Merta who left the clan. The Vampire Merta[edit] Merta can be found at the end of the small Reloth Ancestral Tomb, west of Maar Gan (southeast of Khuul). Return to Raxle when Merta is dead to receive a recall amulet that teleports you back to Galom Daeus. But wait, there is more[edit] Raxle Berne will then tell you that you might receive further reward if you kill several 'worthless' vampires belonging to the Quarra and Aundae clans. Raxle will not give you explicit vampires to kill, but merely request that you return to him once you've killed at least 12 vampires. You can kill any vampires you found in the Druscashti ruins that you visited previously. Lower-level vampires can also be found in the Dulo Ancestral Tomb (just west of Galom Daeus) and other places. Any vampires that you killed previously do not count towards the 12. If you kill any of your own clan during the quest, you will need to kill that many extra from the other clans. Return to Raxle to receive permission to heal yourself using the Clan's cattle (via the Vampire Touch spell). Just be sure not to actually kill any of them.

Locate a copy of the rare book, which exists in various places throughout Vvardenfell. Return to Skink with the book to complete the quest and receive your reward.","Duties[edit] Chat with Skink-in-Tree's-Shade in the Wolverine Hall Mage's Guild about duties, and he'll inform you that he is seeking a rare book, Vampires of Vvardenfell, Vol. II. Skink further tells you that there are two books in this series. The first is common in Morrowind, but the second volume is rare. If you can find a copy of volume two, he would be grateful. He suggests trying a rare bookseller. Another Book for a Mage[edit] By asking around, you might find out that the second volume is banned by the Tribunal Temple, possibly the reason for its rarity. There are several places you can find a copy. One is in Jobasha's Rare Bookshop in Vivec, Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks, for the price of 400 gold. If you don't want to pay, you can also find one in the Hall of Justice Secret Library (accessed through a locked trapdoor in the Justice offices), though the guards won't like you if they see you taking it. However, if you continue to talk to them, they will eventually attack you, allowing you to kill them without incurring a bounty. Yet another copy can be found in some vampire lairs, such as Galom Daeus. Tel Vos also has a copy. It can be found in the Central Tower, a floor below the Dwemer museum. If you are a member of either House Hlaalu or House Telvanni you will eventually be tasked to go to Odirniran to handle some business with the Telvanni necromancer Milyn Faram. In the same room as Milyn, there is a bookshelf on the far wall on the right side of the entrance. Both volumes of Vampires of Vvardenfell are located on the bottom shelf. Whatever the method, locate a copy of the book and return it to Skink. Skink's gratitude[edit] When you return to Skink with the requested volume, he is most pleased. Give him the book, and you are rewarded with a substantial increase in Disposition (+15 points) and 1,000 septims."

Vandacia's Bounty[edit] Just take a Silt Strider to Seyda Neen and kill the tax agent at the Census and Excise Warehouse. You could try taunting before attacking; after five successful taunts or so at 0/100 disposition Adraria Vandacia starts attacking you. She can be found on the top floor of the warehouse, so you will either have to unlock the ground floor door (opposite the building where you can find Sellus Gravius) or levitate/jump from the dock area to the door on the top floor, which deposits you right next to her. You can also find the key to the warehouse next to Sellus Gravius on the bookshelf. Return to Lorbumol for your 500 gold reward."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Vassir-Didanat_Ebony_Mine","Rediscover the Vassir-Didanat Cave south of Balmora by simply entering the cave. This opens a dialogue option with three House Hlaalu councilors. Choose who you'd like to speak to and claim your reward.","Vassir-Didanat Cave[edit] Rather than beginning with a particular person, this quest actually begins at a location. You can find the Vassir-Didanat Cave to the south of Balmora on the other side of the river. If you have done the Fighters Guild quest to eliminate the egg poachers from Shulk Egg Mine, you may have seen the bridge across the river just to the south of the egg mine. Cross the bridge and keep going east, and you should see the cave on the hillside. The cave was actually a former ebony mine that was lost after one of the miners apparently summoned a Daedra that killed everybody inside the mine. Once you enter the cave, you've essentially 'rediscovered' it and open up the dialogue option Vassir-Didanat Mine with three Hlaalu councilors. Of course, feel free to take any ebony that you like for a good amount of gold as they're 200 gold each. However, even though you will still be able to take it after the completion of the quest (as no guards will appear in the mine), you might rather want to leave it if you are not strong enough to face the atronachs inside. Finder's Fee[edit] You can reveal the location to one of the following: Nevena Ules (Ules Manor near Suran), who will not give you anything. Velanda Omani (Omani Manor east of Vivec, St. Olms Canton), who will offer you 2,000 gold. Dram Bero (The Haunted Manor in the Plaza of St. Olms), who will offer you a choice of Daedric weapons: a katana, a bow, a staff, a wakizashi, a spear or a battleaxe, depending on which weapon skill you tell him you prefer. Be aware that you cannot collect more than one reward. Once you have revealed the location of the mine to one of the councilors, the others will only express disappointment that you did not speak with them first. This means that if you reveal the location to Nevena Ules, you will receive nothing for your efforts. You may also report it to Crassius Curio in Vivec's Hlaalu canton and to Serjo Avon Oran in Suran. Both will advise you to speak to either Dram Bero or Velanda Omani; neither will mention Nevena Ules."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Velfred_the_Outlaw_(quest)","Speak to Crassius Curio to learn your next assignment. Travel to Hla Oad and find Velfred the Outlaw. Either kill Velfred or convince him to pay House Hlaalu. Return to Crassius Curio.","Business[edit] Once you've reached the rank of Lawman in House Hlaalu and completed some of the quests for Odral Helvi, you can start receiving quests from good old Crassius Curio in his Manor in Vivec's Hlaalu Plaza. Curio will ask you to get the outlaw Velfred to pay some smuggling fees to House Hlaalu. Curio does not say where you can find the outlaw, but suggests that you try asking around Hla Oad. Finding Velfred[edit] Travel to Hla Oad, southwest of Balmora (the quickest way is by boat from Vivec). The people there will tell you that Velfred and his ship are at a secret dock to the southwest of town. Once you find the outlaw, either convince him to pay the fee (raise his disposition to around 75) or simply kill him. Return to Vivec[edit] Then return to Curio in Vivec to complete the quest and receive 500 gold if you killed the outlaw, or 1000 gold if you persuaded him. Curio's disposition increases by ten and you receive five points of Hlaalu faction reputation either way."

Return to Eydis Fire-Eye for your reward.","Orders[edit] Once you reach the rank of Protector, Eydis Fire-Eye in the Balmora Guild of Fighters will ask you to kill the leader of the Verethi Gang, Dovres Verethi. The Verethi Gang[edit] The Gang are smugglers based in Mannammu, just a little southeast of Pelagiad. Though you only have to kill Dovres, you'll have to go through a half-dozen of his friends to get to him at the very end of the caves. You can skip a couple of his goons, since there is a way directly to him via an aquatic passage. Alternatively, you can simply sneak past all of them using stealth or magic. Return to Eydis for your 1000 Drake reward."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Viatrix,_The_Annoying_Pilgrim","Meet Viatrix Petilia on the road southwest of Ald'ruhn. Escort her to the Shrine of Pride, Ghostgate.","Viatrix, The Annoying Pilgrim[edit] Southwest of Ald'ruhn (northwest of Buckmoth Legion Fort), you may run into Viatrix Petilia. Speak to her to learn that she needs someone to escort her to the Ghostgate within two days. Agree to get her to follow you (though you might regret it as she can be rather annoying). Are we there yet?[edit] The trip, if you haven't made it before, can be quite difficult with reduced visibility and the tough blighted creatures. In addition, you'll pass nearby to one or two Daedric Shrines and might attract the attention of some of the inhabitants. Make sure that Petilia doesn't take too much damage from attackers, or that you don't lose  her in the low visibility of an ash storm. It is a good idea to stop by in Ghostgate before continuing. You must lead her to the shrine inside the Ghostgate, up the path and to the east slightly. You will receive payment of 100 gold once she approaches the shrine. She is very impatient and will bug you several times along the trip about how long it's taking. If you take longer than two days to reach the shrine, you will fail the quest. The reward is meager for the long trip, but then she only promises a ""tip"".  Or, you could just lead her into the wilderness and kill her (or simply ""fail"" to protect her from marauding creatures) for an easy 500 gold, but no weapons or armor.  Note that killing her yourself may get you kicked out of the Tribunal Temple if you are a member of that faction."

Steal some Vintage Brandy from the recently deceased Ralen Hlaalo, in the Hlaalo Manor, or acquire a bottle in any way. Return to Sugar-Lips to complete the quest and receive your reward.","Job[edit] Sugar-Lips Habasi in the South Wall Cornerclub in Balmora asks you to steal some Vintage Brandy from the recently deceased Ralen Hlaalo, in the Hlaalo Manor (not the Hlaalu Council Manor, which is different). Again, any Vintage Brandy should work. Hlaalo Manor[edit] Hlaalo manor is across the river and has two locked entrances, the front door (30) and the balcony door (40). Be careful of the guard patrols when you pick the lock so you aren't noticed. Getting into the Manor is easier from the balcony, since the guards won't notice you easily. To get on the balcony, simply jump from the staircase of the bordering guard tower. Locating the Brandy[edit] There are two locations for the Brandy you are seeking. One is upstairs in Ralen Hlaalo's dresser and the other is on the top center shelf near the body of Ralen. Return to Habasi with the Brandy she's seeking for a reward of 1,000 gold."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Vivec_Informants","Return to Caius in Balmora for your orders. Meet with the informants in Vivec. Huleeya Informant Meet with Huleeya at the Black Shalk Cornerclub in the Foreign Quarter. Calm the locals and escort Huleeya to Jobasha's Bookshop to receive his notes. Addhiranirr Informant Meet with Addhiranirr in the Underworks of the St. Olms Canton. Find and tell the excise agent Duvianus Platorius that Addhiranirr has left for the mainland. Receive the information from Addhiranirr. Meet Mehra Milo Meet with Mehra Milo at the Library of Vivec in the Temple Canton. Steal or buy the book Progress of Truth. Return to Caius in Balmora.","Huleeya Addhiranirr Mehra Milo Orders from Caius[edit] After the last errand, Caius tells you to train for a while and come back to him later. Specifically, your character needs to be at least level 3 before Caius will give you the next assignment. At that point, he sends you on a fact-finding mission to the city of Vivec. Your mission is to track down and rendezvous with three people: Addhiranirr, a Khajiit Thieves Guild member in St. Olms, Huleeya, an Argonian Morag Tong assassin at the Black Shalk Cornerclub in the Foreign Quarter, and Mehra Milo, a Tribunal Temple priestess in the Hall of Wisdom of the Temple Canton. Caius is once again looking for any Sixth House or Nerevarine Cult information and he gives you 200 gold for expenses. The quickest way is to take the Silt Strider or the Mages Guild Guide, but feel free to take the scenic route. Huleeya Informant[edit] Huleeya is in the Black Shalk Cornerclub, in the Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks. He should be easy to find, as he is the only Argonian in the room. Unfortunately, Huleeya seems to be having trouble with the locals, who will not let him pass. Talk with the Dark Elf, Ethys Savil, or one of his two friends, and persuade him to leave the Argonian alone. Raising his disposition a bit will work, but so will homicide. If you try to leave with Huleeya without talking to one of the thugs, they will attack and you will have to protect Huleeya. Attacking the thugs first will result in Huleeya refusing to talk to you. Once you've solved this, you may escort Huleeya unhindered to Jobasha's Rare Books. Jobasha's bookshop is on the same level as the cornerclub, in the Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks, just on the opposite side. Once you're inside the bookshop with Huleeya, you will receive one Reputation point for your help and he will give you some notes to take to Caius. Also while at the bookshop, pick up the book Progress of Truth on the second floor far left bookcase as you will be needing it later in this quest. You can steal it when the Ordinator patrols elsewhere, or just buy it. Addhiranirr Informant[edit] Addhiranirr is the next closest contact in the St. Olms Canton, southeast of the Foreign Quarter (past the Redoran and next to the St. Delyn cantons). It turns out Addhiranirr is difficult to find as almost no one in St. Olms knows where she is. With enough exploration and questions, you do eventually find her all alone in the northeast Underworks, hiding from a Census and Excise agent. In order to get anything out of her, the agent must be taken care of. The agent in question is Duvianus Platorius, who can be found in St. Olms Waistworks. As usual, you can either kill him or persuade him that Addhiranirr has fled. Note that if you happen to accidentally tell him where Addhiranirr is, you can still get the information Caius wants by raising Addhiranirr's disposition until she will talk to you. Also, if you tell Duvianus Platorius where Addhiranirr is and come back later to talk about the topic 'Addhiranirr', he will give you the response normally given if you had chosen to lie to him. Anyway, once the agent is out of the way, Addhiranirr will let you know that the Sixth House is into smuggling, but no one knows what due to intense secrecy. Meet Mehra Milo[edit] The last of the contacts is Mehra Milo. She may be found in the Library of Vivec, located in the Hall of Wisdom in the Temple Canton at the southern end of Vivec. Once you find her and follow her to the back of the library, she will tell you what she knows about the Nerevarine cult. She'll also suggest that you obtain a copy of the book Progress of Truth for Caius. Although the library has a copy of the book, it is under guard, so she suggests trying the local bookshops, even though the book is officially banned by the Tribunal Temple. The copy in the library is the tall book on top of the bookshelf in the southwest corner. Alternatively, you can just buy a copy from Jobasha's Rare Books in the Lower Waistworks of the Foreign Quarter for 150 gold. Other copies can be found at: Tel Uvirith, Arelas' House Vivec, Hall of Justice Secret Library Vivec, Telvanni Tower Return to Caius[edit] Return the information to Caius, who will promote you to Journeyman and suggest you take more time to train and do some other guild work to keep your cover up. Come back for the next part of the quest in a few days."

He will suggest that you use the Silt Strider for traveling, and directs you to the town's Silt Strider operator, Darvame Hleran, while telling you to mention that he sent you. A Little Business Arrangement[edit] Speak with Darvame Hleran and mention Vodunius Nuccius to learn that the two have a business arrangement. Furthermore, she shares with you her belief that Vodunius Nuccius is unhappy in Vvardenfell. I Wanna Go Home[edit] Return to Vodunius with this information and he will tell you that, indeed, he is not happy. The only reason he's not on the next boat to Narsis is a lack of funds; he doesn't have the money to leave. He offers to sell you his cursed ring for 100 gold; if you turn down the offer or don't have the funds for the purchase, you can return at a later point. If you buy the ring, leave, and then return to Seyda Neen, Vodunius Nuccius will be gone, presumably traveling to Narsis. You can use the bed in his house if you can get past the level 30 lock, although anything you take and anything you put in his containers will be marked as stolen."

Travel to the cave, and fight your way through to the last mage, Vindamea Drethan. Defeat Vindamea Drethan, and recover the artifact from her corpse. Return the ring to Ajira, and she will let you keep it.","Duties[edit] Once you've reached the rank of Warlock, Ajira in the Balmora Guild of Mages will tell you about the Warlock's Ring after you've found the Staff of Magnus. This isn't a quest per se, but merely a chance to acquire a powerful magical item for your arsenal. Warlock's Ring[edit] The ring is currently held by Vindamea Drethan in Ashirbadon, a cave on a small island east of the ruins of Bal Fell, just east of the city of Vivec at the bottom of the map. Indeed, just head directly east from the ruins and it is on the first island you reach. The cave is small though filled with several tough creatures possibly including atronachs, dremora, and daedroth. Vindamea is again a high level mage wielding the Warlock's Ring and can be tough to take out. Don't forget to check for treasure once you've killed her."

Apparently, he has been waiting to meet someone there and they have not yet shown up, and he asks you for a favor. The Weapon Delivery[edit] You are to deliver four weapons (a Steel Shortsword, a Silver Flameblade, a Steel Staff and a Silver War Axe) to Yak gro-Skandar at the Rat in the Pot club in Ald'ruhn. You'll receive a whole 100 gold for the delivery and, if you are a Thieves Guild member, a faction increase as well. If you decide to keep the weapons instead of delivering them, know that the first time you leave Ald'ruhn, Lucan will appear and attack you. Unfortunately, once you're in this position, there's no way to fix it in game since Yak won't accept the weapons anymore and Lucan won't calm down. You can either kill him or lead him out to the wilderness and then lose him. It should also be noted that this fail-safe can trigger while you're still in the vicinity of Ald'ruhn, so it's quite easy to unintentionally fail this quest because of this oversight."

Slay the vampire Marara and take her ring.","Rumors[edit] Ask around Tel Mora for rumors to learn that a powerful vampire named Marara has been killing people lately. Find Marara in the Drethan Ancestral Tomb, southwest of Ald Daedroth, to learn more. The Weary Vampire[edit] It seems that this vampire has become tired of life (or undeath to be more accurate) which explains her recent murders. In order to end it all, she wishes to be killed by one of her own kind... which would be you. A useful ring[edit] At her death, you'll receive the useful Marara's Ring. This quest can only be completed if you are a vampire. However, if you aren't a vampire, you can still kill her to get the ring, but you just miss out on her speech about unlife and the journal entries."

Find the Ghost of Vabas's husband, and take Lugrub's Axe. Return to Darius in Gnisis and report your findings. Head back to the egg mine and kill Lugrub gro-Ogdum. Report back to Darius.","General Darius at the Madach Tradehouse in Gnisis will ask you to retrieve a land deed from the Widow Vabdas, whose husband died recently in the Gnisis Eggmine. The General wants Vabdas' land for a new dock and tells you not to take 'no' for an answer. Check around town to learn that the widow Vabdas lives in a hut west of town. If you talk to her about the deed she will refuse to give it to you. Instead, she says that her husband was murdered by a legionnaire when he went to the closed mine and she wants you to find out what happened. Head for the mine on the east side of town on the hill and speak to the guard Vatollia Apo about the ""Eggmine"" topic. Since you're in the Legion he will give you a key to the mine without the need for a high disposition or carrying of Miner's Pick. Note that you must be wearing Imperial armor for this, otherwise talking to him just lowers his disposition by 5. The first area of the mine doesn't have much to it, though you'll find an aggressive Orc (Lugrub gro-Ogdum) in the Lower area who will attack unless you leave the area quickly enough. Also in this area, you will see a Kwama Queen. Be careful not to kill her as she needs to be alive for Darius' next quest. Explore the lower mines until you find the ghost of Mansilamat Vabdas in the underground stream. It will tell you that Lugrub killed him to hide the fact that he was sleeping on the job when Vabdas entered. As evidence, he directs you to the broken axe (Lugrub's Axe) at the bottom of the pool nearby. Return to Darius with the proof of the murder. Give him the axe and his disposition will increase by 3 and he will tell you to go and kill Lugrub. Do so and report back to Darius. His disposition will increase by 20 and he will reward you with an Imperial Broadsword. If you talk to Darius about the deed afterwards, it will turn out that the Legion has started a donation fund for the widow, to which you can contribute if you want. Alternatively, the investigation can be skipped by stealing the land deed, which is found in a locked (40) chest on your right as you enter Widow Vabdas' house. The widow holds its key. If you present the stolen deed to Darius you still receive the sword and reputation award, but his disposition increase is only 10."

He was escorting Iveri Llothri to Tel Aruhn when she turned on him, placed him under a curse, and stole his clothing and gold. Most importantly, she also stole his ancestral axe, Widowmaker. He asks you for your help in the matter, saying the witch ran off to the northwest. Finding the Witch[edit] The witch's campsite is not too far in that direction, but beyond Andalor Ancestral Tomb and an encampment of rogue Ashlanders. (With Botrir in tow, you may want to tend to the encampment and tomb at some other time.) If you arrive without Botrir, and have adequate Personality, you can discuss most anything other than Widowmaker or Botrir with Iveri, but she otherwise leaves you little choice in your options: She attacks you, if you and Botrir approach together. Botrir will likewise attack her and you can aid him, take the brunt of her attack while he kills her, or watch Iveri kill him if you can avoid her detecting your presence. Widowmaker[edit] Once the witch is dead, loot her corpse to find the axe. If you give the axe to the barbarian you will receive a bonus to your Axe skill. If you decide to keep the axe, Botrir will attack you. You could hand the axe over for the skill bonus and then kill him to take back the weapon. Alternatively, just pick his pocket and take the axe right back. The skill lesson won't increase your axe skill level over 100."

Find Kagrenac's Journal and Planbook in Endusal and Tureynulal. Bring the books to Yagrum, and wait a day while he studies them in order to harmonize Wraithguard to your magicka signature. Equip Wraithguard, and be prepared to lose 200-225 Health, permanently.","God-Killer[edit] So, you killed Vivec, and you still want to complete the Main Quest?  Don't worry, all is not lost.  The Back-Path is much more difficult, but still possible.  First you must retrieve the Unique Dwemer Artifact from his divine corpse.  Nobody will tell you what to do with it.  You must find out on your own.  It might help to look at the scrolls found in the alcoves inside Vivec's Palace. The Last Living Dwarf[edit] Yagrum Bagarn is the last of the Dwemer, and he can be found in the Corprusarium in Tel Fyr.  If you have done much of the Main Quest, you would have met him during the Corprus Cure quest.  If you speak to him with the Unique Dwemer Artifact in your possession, he will recognize it as Wraithguard, and offer to help you activate it.  Ask him about ""mythopoeic enchantments"" to hear his advice on the matter.  Note that in order to receive his aid you must either have a Reputation of at least 20 or be able to show him Dagoth Ur's Plans and the Plan to Defeat Dagoth Ur, both found in Vivec's Palace. Kagrenac's Books[edit] Yagrum will ask you to retrieve two books written by Kagrenac, who helped to construct Wraithguard.  They can be found in Endusal and Tureynulal, respectively.  These two ancient Dwemer Ruins are located on either side of the Dagoth Ur Facility in the Red Mountain region.  They are home to many powerful Ash Creatures, including the Ash Vampires Dagoth Endus and Dagoth Tureynul.  Once you have found the Journal and Planbook, return to Tel Fyr and present them to Yagrum Bagarn. Harmonizing Wraithguard[edit] When you show him the books, Yagrum will ask you to give him a day to study them.  Return in 24 hours (or just wait), and speak to him again.  He will have Wraithguard ready for you, but he will give you a strong warning.  Equipping the artifact will cause a permanent loss of 200-225 maximum Health.  He will recommend that you use a Fortify Health; however, this is not practical. Fortifying your health only fortifies your *current* health and doing this will not avoid the loss to your *maximum* health. Once the spell or potion wears off, your health will then be reduced by however much you fortified it, and if this brings you below 0 you will die.  Likewise for wearing Constant Effect enchanted items.  If you remove them, or if they are damaged to the point of breaking, you may find yourself dead rather quickly.  The safest thing is to have more than 230 health to begin with, and probably a lot more, as wandering around Red Mountain with only 20 maximum health is likely to be somewhat hazardous.  Fortunately, this loss of health is one-time only, and if you survive, you may equip and unequip the Wraithguard as many times as you wish without worry."

Buy exquisite shirt, skirt, and shoes, and Telvanni Bug Musk. Escort the slave girl back to Kaushad's Yurt. Be named as the Nerevarine of the Zainab Tribe.","The Zainab Camp[edit] If you haven't found out the location of the Zainab Camp yet, return to the Urshilaku Camp and find out from the Ashlanders. The quickest route from the Zainab Camp back to the Urshilaku Camp is to grab a ship from Tel Mora to Dagon Fel and onto Khuul. The Zainab Camp is located southwest of Vos and southeast from the Cavern of the Incarnate. The camp is again out in the wilderness and the nearest city is Tel Mora, which can be reached by boat. From Tel Mora, head southwest to reach the camp (check your in-game world map). The shrewd Ashkhan of the Zainab Sonummu Zabamat[edit] Once you reach the Zainab Camp, go to the Wise Woman's Yurt and talk to Sonummu Zabamat to show her your proofs to fulfill the Nerevarine Prophecies. She tells you to talk to Ashkhan Kaushad. In order to get him to talk to you about the Prophecies, you will need to raise his disposition to around 70 by the usual means, or by giving him a gift of exquisite shoes. Still, Kaushad is just a little wary of your claims. If you ask him to set you a task to prove yourself, he lets you know of a vampire named Calvario in Nerano Ancestral Tomb which needs to be taken care of. The man certainly is a shrewd negotiator, a true specimen of his tribe. Nerano Ancestral Tomb[edit] The tomb is north and slightly west of the camp (west of Vos, Tel Vos, and Tel Mora) and will not be marked on your map. Kaushad says it is ""nearby"", but it is rather far. Talk to him about Nerano Ancestral Tomb before leaving and he'll give you directions.  If you previously found this tomb while wandering or from clues in other locations, and killed Calvario, this dialogue topic will update your journal without you having to go to the tomb again. The tomb is a small one, and you should quickly find Calvario, but watch out for other undead populating the tomb. Calvario is not too tough, but his health-absorbing ability might make the fight last longer than usual. Returning to Kaushad, he congratulates you on your accomplishment, but there's just one more thing he wants you to do ....  Falura Llervu before...    ...and after her transformation Bride for Kaushad[edit] The ashkhan wants you find him a bride, and not just any bride, but a high-born Telvanni; pretty, plump, with big hips. He suggests talking to Zabamat for more information.  Sonummu Zabamat suggests that you buy a slave girl from Savile Imayn in Tel Aruhn, dress her up as a Telvanni lady and bring her to Kaushad, who won't know the difference. If you ask Zabamat about Tel Aruhn she will mark the village on your map, far southeast of the Zainab Camp. There's no real quick way but to just walk there, although by using Divine Intervention, you can fast travel to Wolverine Hall, and take a boat or a shorter walk to Tel Aruhn. Savile is standing outside Tel Aruhn by the northern Underground entrance. Once you mention that you are looking for something special, she says she has just the girl but needs an exquisite shirt, skirt, and shoes first. She says that Elegnan, the clothier in Tel Mora far to the north, probably sells such items. Fortunately, you can get a boat between Tel Aruhn and Tel Mora; Elegnan is easily found on the south side of town near the boats. Of course, once you return to Savile, there's just one more thing you need, a bottle of Telvanni Bug Musk. If you don't have any, you can buy some from Bildren the apothecary in town (though you may buy some from Jolda as well; another option is, of course, theft). Once you have the musk, you can buy the slave Falura Llervu from her for 1200 gold (though depending on your Mercantile skill and disposition, you can get away with as little as 600). Named as the Nerevarine[edit] Unlock the door next to Savile to free Falura and talk to her to give her the clothes and musk and then get her to follow you. As with all escorts, ensure that you don't run too far ahead of her and be careful of any creatures, especially in the water. The easiest way is to take a boat back to Vos and walk from there. If you run too far ahead there is a good chance you'll lose her, temporarily at least. Once you arrive in the Ashkhan's Yurt and talk with him, he will thank you for the bride and name you the Zainab Nerevarine, giving you the Thong of Zainab as proof of your title. After you've delivered Falura to Kaushad, if you talk to the Ashkhan about Telvanni bride after you've talked to Falura about my bridegroom, he tells you he knows perfectly well you tricked him. But he's not angry, in fact, he's somewhat impressed with your cunning and he likes the girl more than he would a real Telvanni lady. You even get a wedding gift (an Exquisite Shirt)."

Visit the nearby bookseller, Codus Callonus, and buy a book as a gift for Hassour. Give the gift to Hassour and receive the note for Caius in return. Return to Caius in Balmora.","Orders from Caius[edit] Caius Cosades' next task is to try to establish an Ashlander informant. He has heard rumors that Hassour Zainsubani, an Ashlander who is now a wealthy trader, is staying in Ald'ruhn. Caius gives you 100 gold and asks you to try and find out what he likes and buy him a present in the hopes of persuading him to talk about the Ashlanders tribes and their relationship to the Nerevarine Cult. Although Caius says he's not sure where to find this gentleman, he suggests the Ald Skar Inn. If you haven't been to Ald'ruhn before, it's basically far north of Balmora, past Caldera. The quickest way is to grab a Silt Strider from Balmora, although Mages Guild members might prefer to use the Guild Guide instead. Meet with Hassour Zainsubani[edit] The Ald Skar Inn is just southwest of the big Manor District building in Ald'ruhn and Hassour is on the middle level (there are stairs right of the bar leading to the area). First thing to do when you talk with Hassour Zainsubani is ask about business and that will bring up the topic about gifts. Chatting with him you indeed find out that it is an Ashlander custom to give gifts and that Hassour's passion happens to include poetry. So, just give him that book of poetry you've been reading and... what, you don't have one? Well, time to visit the local bookshops to see what books they have in stock. Note that you can also talk to other people to get this info, or explore his room in the other, larger downstairs part of the Inn to see what sort of books he has. Just as luck would have it, Codus Callonus' bookstore is located nearby, and Codus actually suggests a few selections when you mention Hassour (Words of the Wind 45 gold, Ashland Hymns 35 gold, or The Five Far Stars 25 gold). Now, if you have explored Hassour's room, you'll know he already has all three of them but he'll accept any as a gift. If you're really tricky (and cheap) you can steal one of his own books from his room and give it back to him (he shouldn't notice). Alternatively, if you raise his disposition to 80 or higher, you can discuss the Ashlander gift-giving customs, and he will take your ""thought and effort"" as a gift. Return to Caius[edit] Once you get Hassour to talk with you about the Ashlanders and Nerevarine Cult, you'll receive his notes for Caius. Return to Caius, and he again promotes you and suggests you keep the notes, as he is sending you to the Urshilaku Ashlander Camp that Hassour mentioned. He also goes on to explain things a bit. It appears that you were released and recruited on the Emperor's orders.  The Emperor believes that you may fit the Nerevarine prophecies. Caius gives you a decoded copy of the original package you delivered to him along with 200 gold and instructions to see Somutis Vunnis and Crulius Pontanian at the Moonmoth Legion Fort before heading up to see the heads of the Nerevarine Cult at the Urshilaku Camp."

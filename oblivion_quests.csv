"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Accidents_Happen","Receive your next contract from Vicente Valtieri. Travel to Baenlin's house in Bruma. Kill Baenlin. (Optional) Release the mounted Minotaur head. Return to Vicente to collect your reward.","Blood of the Damned[edit] The mini-quest to get the contract from Vicente Valtieri is called ""Blood of the Damned"". To complete it, you just need to accept the contract from Vicente. A Regular Routine...[edit] Once you accept the contract, Vicente will tell you what needs to be done: ""As I expected. Good. The target is a Wood Elf named Baenlin. You will find him at his home in Bruma. Enter secretly and avoid his manservant, Gromm. On the second floor is a secreted door leading to a crawlspace. Inside are the fastenings of a mounted head that hangs over Baenlin's favorite chair. Loosen the fastenings any night between 8:00 pm and 11:00 pm, and the head will surely fall on Baenlin as he relaxes in his chair, as is custom. If Baenlin is killed in any other manner, or if the manservant Gromm is killed, you will forfeit the bonus. Now go, and may Sithis be with you."" You are now directed to go to Bruma and kill the target Baenlin in his own home. If you speak to Gogron or Teinaava before you leave, they will also provide an insight on his manservant, Gromm: ""The manservant's name is Gromm, you say? Sounds like a Nord. Probably a big one. If he catches you, get ready for a serious fight."" and ""If the target is old and weak, as you say, then his manservant is sure to be quite the opposite. Best to stay out of his way."" ""...and the head will surely fall on Baenlin as he relaxes in his chair, as is custom."" ...Goes Horribly Wrong[edit] When you arrive in Bruma, Baenlin's house is located just north of the eastern gate. If you spoke to Antoinetta beforehand, she'll give you some advice about how to enter the house: ""How do you plan on entering this man's house? Through the front door? Be smart and look for a more inconspicuous way in, like a cellar entrance."" Following her suggestion, you can find a door leading into the basement situated at the rear of the house, providing a safe and indirect access. Once inside the house, sneak upstairs, enter the room closest to the stairs, and proceed into the crawlspace through the door hidden in the wall. The precarious fastenings are at the end of the crawlspace, but remember Vicente's directions: ""Loosen the fastenings any night between 8:00 pm and 11:00 pm, and the head will surely fall on Baenlin as he relaxes in his chair, as is custom."" Wait until it is between those times before you release the mounted head, which will fall on Baenlin in his seat, killing him instantly. A Deadly Advancement[edit] Sneaking out the same way you came, you will notice Gromm standing in front of Baenlin's dead body. Be careful not to attract his attention as he will now attack you on sight. Retreat through the basement and out into Bruma, then return to the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary. Valtieri will comment on your completion of the contract. If you killed Baenlin in the manner requested, he will say: ""So, the accident has been staged, and Baenlin lies dead. Well done! You have more than earned your reward and bonus."" However, if you completed the mission in some other way, he will be disappointed: ""Baenlin is dead, yes, but you did not fulfill the contract precisely as directed. I will grant your reward of gold, but the bonus is forfeit."" He will then reward you with a leveled amount of gold (up to 600 gold) and an advancement to Slayer. If you successfully made Baenlin's death seem like an accident, you will receive the bonus reward Sufferthorn. You can now accept the next quest from Vicente, and the quest Scheduled for Execution will begin."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Acrobatics_Training","When your Acrobatics skill reaches 70, speak with Ganredhel in Cheydinhal or Tsrava in Leyawiin. Once you have the recommendation, head to Aerin's Camp to speak with Aerin. When you arrive you will find Torbern instead, who agrees to train you.","An Acrobat's Test[edit] Once your Acrobatics skill is 70 or higher, speak with either Ganredhel in the city of Cheydinhal or with Tsrava in Leyawiin to learn who can teach you more about Acrobatics. You will be told that Aerin is the only one that can do it and you are sent to find her at her camp. They helpfully mark the location on your map. A Missing Trainer[edit] Aerin's Camp is in the far northeast corner of Cyrodiil, north of Cheydinhal and east of Bruma. Reaching it can be a challenge. The easiest way to get here is to follow an unmarked road that leads there. Otherwise you will have to traverse some steep slopes. Although Ganredhel and Tsrava will tell you to find Aerin for master training, Aerin is nowhere to be found. However, you will find Torbern, who agrees to train you in her absence. Unlike most of the master trainers, he doesn't require you to do anything in order to receive training."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Affairs_of_a_Wizard","Retrieve your first dead drop from a hollow rock on Hero Hill. Head to Leafrot Cave. Learn of the lich's weakness, and decide how you will deal with Celedaen. Head to the next dead drop under the Great Oak in Chorrol.","The Dead Drop[edit] This is your first contract as a Silencer of the Black Hand and is initiated by ""The Dead Drop"" mini-quest, which requires you to travel to Hero Hill to find your orders. Your target is Celedaen, a necromancer in Leafrot Cave who is trying to gain favor with the great Sovereign by attaining lichdom. Once you get inside, you will come upon a few leveled undead near a bedroll, with some alchemical equipment, a chest, and various books - make sure you look for the Destruction skill book, The Art of War Magic. Lich's Weakness[edit] On the table is Celedaen's journal, The Path of Transcendence, which tells of his quest for becoming one of the undead, specifically, one of the Worm Eremites. According to the journal, the fabled way of killing liches by shattering their Soul Container at any time is actually a myth. The only way to truly kill a lich is to, during the transformation, remove his Soul Container from his physical person while it is being used to transport his soul from his mortal body. Luckily, his transformation is not yet complete, leaving that weakness open for exploitation. This gives you two options: simply fight this powerful mage, or sneak up on him and pickpocket his Soul Container: the Sands of Resolve (looks like an hourglass). If you steal the hourglass, he will die instantly, and you will simply need to go to the next Dead Drop in Chorrol to complete this quest."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Ahdarji%27s_Heirloom","Go to your new Doyen, S'Krivva in Bravil, to receive this quest. Travel to Leyawiin and speak with Ahdarji to get the details of the quest. Discover the whereabouts of Amusei and question him about the ring. Steal the ring from Countess Alessia Caro. Return the ring to Ahdarji for a reward, and report to S'Krivva for another reward.","If you plan on doing all the intermediate steps to this quest, then before you embark on it, make sure to have at least one lockpick on you that you will be giving away. There will also be many locked doors, a locked chest and a locked jewelry box that you can deal with however you usually deal with locked items, including using spells and/or pickpocketing up to five keys, one for a dungeon, one for the secret room doors, one for the castle interior doors, one for the bedroom door and a final one for the jewelry box at the end. Go to your new Doyen, S'Krivva in Bravil, to receive this quest. She will tell you that a ring has been stolen by someone not in the guild from a Khajiit named Ahdarji, the widow of a former fence and also a former Thieves Guild member herself. Since the guild frowns on rogue or freelance thieves, they are willing to help Ahdarji; more precisely, they are willing to send you to help her. Speak with Ahdarji[edit] Speak to any beggar in Leyawiin and you will be told that Ahdarji lives on the west side of town (she actually lives on the east), goes to the Three Sisters' Inn in the evenings, and eats her midday meals at the Five Claws Lodge. Find her at one of those locations, and speak to her. Ahdarji tells you that an Argonian named Amusei (remember him?) stole the ring. She wants you to kill him and get her ring back. Of course, you can't kill him since he is essential until The Ultimate Heist is completed, so she says to at least make him suffer. Amusei is in jail Question Amusei[edit] Talk to a beggar to find out where Amusei is. Pay one of them and you learn that he was arrested for trying to swindle Alessia Caro, the Countess of Leyawiin. You also find out that the guards accept bribes to allow people to visit prisoners. Head to the castle dungeon and talk to the jailor. He tells you that ""dirty lizards"" aren't allowed to have visitors per the countess' orders; however, 20 gold quickly changes his tune. Picking the lock to the dungeon is also possible, though the lock is level-dependent. If you don't even want to do that, pickpocket the guard and steal his dungeon key. Go downstairs, and ask Amusei where the ring is. He questions why he should tell you. Bribe him with a lockpick, and he reveals that the ring didn't originally belong to Ahdarji, but rather to the countess. After stealing it from Ahdarji, he tried to ransom it back to her and was arrested. The ring is now in the hands of the countess. Steal the Ring[edit] In order to avoid a possible future bug, you must then return to Ahdarji and tell her that Amusei tried to sell the ring back, she will say that she will make better use of the ring and will pay double for you to steal it back for her. If you talk to a beggar, he or she will tell you to talk to Hlidara Mothril, the countess' handmaiden, who stays with the countess all day. The beggar will also tell you about other ""secrets"" in the castle: a torture chamber specifically for Argonians. Oddly enough, you can get the tip about Hlidara Mothril from the Count himself, although he mentions nothing of the torture chamber. You can ask the countess about the ring, too, and she doesn't seem to get suspicious. Finally, you can also ask Leyawiin Castle members about the ring and finding the Countess. RemasteredOblivion The secret torture chamber The secret torture chamber Speak to Hlidara Mothril: With a disposition of 60, Hlidara Mothril tells you the countess' schedule (she is away from Leyawiin from the 15th to the 17th of every month) With a disposition of 70, Hlidara Mothril tells you the countess wears the ring at all times except for baths and while she's sleeping, at which point it is left in a jewelry box. She will also tell you about a secret passage from the torture room to the countess' private quarters. The countess sleeps at 11pm and her jewelry box is to the right of her bed on the dresser. Wait until about 1am and proceed to the countess' private quarters. Head to the Castle Leyawiin Basement to find a lever hidden in an open barrel. Pull the lever and the wall will open up, revealing a passage to the secret torture room. There's a second lever you'll have to pull hidden in the secret passage. Pick the leveled lock on the next door (or steal the key from the count or Caelia Draconis beforehand), sneak left past the patrolling guard, and pick the lock on the leveled private chambers' door. You can also try reaching the Private Quarters via the County Hall itself, but you will have to avoid more denizens and guards that way. Once inside the countess' room, pick the leveled lock on the jewelry box or pickpocket the key from the countess, grab the ring and some minor treasure, including the letter called Divining the Elder Scolls (which is worth 50 gold), and go out the way you came in. Beware, the guard is still patrolling. Reward[edit] Return to Ahdarji, and give her the ring for a 200 gold reward for your efforts (if you don't tell her Amusei tried to sell the ring, she only gives you 100 gold). Finally, return to S'Krivva for another 200 gold reward, rank advancement to Prowler, and your next mission."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Alchemy_Acquisitions","Raminus Polus informs you of a service provided to Traven by a guildmate. Talk to Julienne Fanis about creating alchemy ingredients. Use the Enchanted Chest to make more alchemy ingredients.","Talk with Julienne Fanis[edit] You receive this quest immediately upon completing Confront the King. Simply follow your compass to find Julienne Fanis and talk to her about alchemical ingredients. She will reveal that you can place an ingredient in the Enchanted Chest in the Arch-Mage's quarters once a week and it will create several samples of it. She will also warn you that if you take longer than a week to retrieve the duplicated items, everything in the chest will disappear. Using the Chest[edit] Once you place a compatible ingredient into the chest, it will add ten more portions of that ingredient within 24 hours. You can only add one ingredient at a time - if you add multiple ingredients, they will not duplicate and the chest will consume all of them in 24 hours. You will lose the added portions of the ingredient and the original ingredient if you fail to collect them within one week. Once your ingredients have multiplied, you must wait a week from the time you first placed the original ingredient in the chest before you can use the chest again. Additionally, it does not matter how many portions of an ingredient you place in the chest as only ten more portions will be added to what you put in. Compatible Ingredients[edit] The list of compatible ingredients is actually coded in the script that the chest uses. Below is the list of these ingredients. Placing more than one type of ingredient in the chest will cause them all to disappear after a day. All items other than the ingredients listed in the chart below will disappear after a day. Food[edit] Apple Beef Blackberry Bread Loaf Carrot Cheese Wedge Corn Flour Garlic Grapes Ham Ironwood Nut Leek Lettuce Onion Pear Pumpkin Radish Rice Strawberry Sweetcake Sweetroll Tobacco Tomato Watermelon Wheat Grain Plants[edit] Alkanet Flower Aloe Vera Leaves Arrowroot Bergamot Seeds Bloodgrass Columbine Root Pulp Dragon's Tongue Fennel Seeds Flax Seeds Ginkgo Leaf Ginseng Harrada Lady's Mantle Leaves Lady's Smock Leaves Lavender Sprig Mandrake Root Milk Thistle Seeds Monkshood Root Pulp Morning Glory Root Pulp Motherwort Sprig Mugwort Seeds Nightshade Peony Seeds Primrose Leaves Redwort Flower Sacred Lotus Seeds Somnalius Frond Spiddal Stick St. Jahn's Wort Nectar Tiger Lily Nectar Viper's Bugloss Leaves Water Hyacinth Nectar White Seed Pod Wormwood Leaves Mushrooms[edit] Bog Beacon Asco Cap Cairn Bolete Cap Cinnabar Polypore Yellow Cap Clouded Funnel Cap Dryad Saddle Polypore Cap Elf Cup Cap Emetic Russula Cap Fly Amanita Cap Green Stain Cup Cap Steel Blue Entoloma Cap Stinkhorn Cap Summer Bolete Cap Tinder Polypore Cap Wisp Stalk Caps From Creatures[edit] Boar Meat Bonemeal (both types) Clannfear Claws Crab Meat Daedra Heart Daedra Silk Daedra Venin Daedroth Teeth Dreugh Wax Ectoplasm Fire Salts Frost Salts Glow Dust Imp Gall Minotaur Horn Mort Flesh Mutton Ogre's Teeth Rat Meat Scales Scamp Skin Troll Fat Vampire Dust (both types) Venison Void Salts Unique Ingredients[edit] If you attempt to duplicate Bloodcrust Vampire Dust or Deranged Zombies' Bonemeal, the chest will take those rare ingredients and return the normal versions; not only does the chest create ten normal samples, but the initial sample is also transformed into a normal one. So while you cannot sell the Vampire Dust that you received from killing the vampires at Bloodcrust Cavern to Roland Jenseric, you can instead use the dust to make normal Vampire Dust with the Enchanted Chest, then turn around and sell all eleven samples for 250 gold each. This is a quick way to earn gold, provided that you have completed the Order of the Virtuous Blood quest. Incompatible Ingredients[edit] Below is a list of all the ingredients in the original distribution of Oblivion that can not be reproduced in this chest. None of the ingredients introduced by the Shivering Isles official expansion can be reproduced in the chest, nor can the three ingredients introduced by the Mehrunes' Razor and Vile Lair add-ons. Ambrosia Ashes of Hindaril Cheese Wheel Cinnabar Polypore Red Cap Foxglove Nectar Green Stain Shelf Cap Human Heart Human Skin Jumbo Potato Lichor Nirnroot Orange Painted Troll Fat Pinarus' Prize Minotaur Horn Poisoned Apple Potato Rat Poison Refined Frost Salts Root Pulp Rumare Slaughterfish Scales Shepherd's Pie S'jirra's Famous Potato Bread Taproot Unicorn Horn The Unofficial Oblivion Patch, version 1.4.0, addresses this issue.

Both can be randomly found in any container that stocks upper class drinks, and he will accept stolen wine. Places where you are guaranteed to find both wines are: 6 bottles of Surilie and 7 bottles of Tamika are in Castle Skingrad, in the Wine Cellar 1 bottle of Surilie and 4 bottles of Tamika are in the basement of Roland Jenseric's House in the Imperial City Temple District 1 of each are in Castle Bravil, in the Lord's Manor North Wing 1 of each are upstairs in the Private Quarters of The Main Ingredient in the Imperial City Market District 1 bottle of Surilie and 2 of Tamika are found by the wine racks in the Frostcrag Spire vault 1 bottle of Tamika and 2 of Surilie are in the master bedroom of the West Wing at Cloud Ruler Temple (taking them is not counted as stealing if you have joined the Blades) Places where you are guaranteed to find the Surilie only are:  2 bottles are in the Cheydinhal Mages Guild (on the table on the top floor) 2 bottles are in Lord Drad's Estate 2 bottles are in Cyronin Sintav's House (upstairs in the Private Quarters) in the Imperial City Elven Gardens District 2 bottles are in Rythe Lythandas's House in Cheydinhal 2 bottles are in Dul gro-Shug's House (upstairs in the Private Quarters) in Imperial City Elven Gardens District 1 bottle is in Crowhaven 1 bottle is in Heinrich Oaken-Hull's House in Anvil 1 bottle is in the basement of Pennus Mallius' House in the Imperial City Temple District 1 bottle is in the basement of The Foaming Flask in the Imperial City Talos Plaza District 1 bottle is in the Imperial Guard Quarters in the Imperial Palace 1 bottle is in Vilena Donton's House in Chorrol   Places where you are guaranteed to find the Tamika only are:  4 bottles are upstairs in The All-Saints Inn (in Willet's Private Quarters) in the Imperial City Temple District 2 bottles are in Willow Bank in Cheydinhal 1 bottle is in the Arch-Mage's quarters in the Arcane University 1 bottle is in Lost Black Rock Chasm 1 bottle is in the Chorrol Mages Guild (on the table immediately to the left as you enter) 1 bottle is in Kvatch Castle in the Count's Quarters 1 bottle is upstairs in the Lustratorium, Arcane University 1 bottle is in the Anvil Castle Royal Quarters 1 bottle is on the top floor of Francois Motierre's House After you bring him one of each wine, Sinderion will agree to train you."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Allies_for_Bruma","This is an optional quest that can be done at any point after completing Bruma Gate and before starting Defense of Bruma. You can also partially complete it - i.e. get aid sent from some, but not all of the cities. Once you have completed the Defense of Bruma, Allies for Bruma will be automatically marked completed in your journal, even if you did not recruit everyone. You are sent to request more troops for Captain Burd. He tells you to petition the other cities, the guilds, and the Elder Council to send temporary relief troops to Bruma. Go to each city and ask the count or countess of each for ""Aid for Bruma"". After each city has provided aid, that city's troops will set up camp in Bruma.","More Troops[edit] Jauffre tells you that the Daedra are innumerable while the Bruma town guard are not. He therefore asks you to go and petition the other cities in Cyrodiil, the guilds and the Elder Council to send temporary relief troops to help close any Oblivion Gates that open around town. Cities[edit] Visit any or all of the cities marked by quest markers on your map and ask the count or countess for ""Aid for Bruma"". If you visit the Imperial City, High Chancellor Ocato will refuse to call in the legions as they are needed to maintain order in the other provinces. Note that the moment you enter the Imperial Palace District, Ocato will start to move towards his quarters, which are past an unpickable locked door. If this happens, move out of the Imperial Palace district, wait for an hour, then go back and head immediately for the palace. Ocato should be just inside the main door when you enter. In Kvatch, you must first complete the Battle for Castle Kvatch and then ask Savlian Matius for aid. If you previously did this quest, Savlian is still standing in the ruined castle. Even though the city is still burning, Savlian will send one anonymous ""Kvatch Soldier"". For each of the other six cities, the ruler will refuse to send aid until you close the Oblivion gate threatening their city; these gates all opened after you completed Dagon Shrine. Enter each of the six Oblivion gates in turn, take the Sigil Stones to close them, then ask the counts or countesses of those cities to relocate guardsmen to Bruma. They will be so glad that you closed the gates that they will give up a few soldiers and send them to Bruma. Note that when you talk to the ruler of those cities, the quest markers for all cities will disappear to be replaced by the quest marker for the specific Oblivion gate to close. Once the gate is closed and the count or countess agrees to send soldiers, the quest markers for all incomplete cities will reappear.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Alteration_Training","Once you have an Alteration skill of 70, speak with Abhuki at Faregyl Inn or Athragar at the Chorrol Mages Guild to learn who can train you further. When you have acquired the recommendation, speak with Tooth-in-the-Sea for master training in Alteration. Prove yourself worthy of master training by surviving three hours underwater.","Ready for More?[edit] Once you have leveled up your Alteration skill to 70, head to Faregyl Inn, located northwest of the Inn of Ill Omen, or to the Chorrol Mages Guild and ask either the Khajiit publican Abhuki or the Bosmer spell merchant Athragar about further training in Alteration. They will tell you that the only one that can train you further is Tooth-in-the-Sea, an Argonian who enjoys swimming in the waters of Niben Bay. Searching Niben Bay[edit] Tooth-in-the-Sea can be found north of the city of Bravil on the coast of Niben Bay; his encampment is slightly east of the Flooded Mine. He will only give you his challenge before 1pm and while he is swimming in the bay; otherwise he will tell you to wait until he has found his favorite spot. Once you have spoken with him, he will let you know how you can prove you are worthy of his training. The Test[edit] RemasteredOblivion Tooth-in-the-Sea at the bottom of Niben Bay Tooth-in-the-Sea at the bottom of Niben Bay You need to stay underwater for three hours in-game (about six minutes in player time) without wandering too far away from him. There are several ways to accomplish this: Create a custom Water Breathing spell or purchase one from Trayvond the Redguard at the Cheydinhal Mages Guild, Ungarion at A Warlock's Luck in Bravil or Edgar Vautrine at Edgar's Discount Spells in the Market District of the Imperial City. If you have done the Cheydinhal Recommendation quest for the Mages Guild, you will have been given the Buoyancy spell which will do the job. Create a custom potion with alchemical ingredients. Note that without a master level in Alchemy, you will need at least two ingredients with Water Breathing as a common effect to create a potion. Wear an item with a permanent Water Breathing effect. Three such items that can be easily obtained are Fin Gleam, the Jewel of the Rumare, and Nistor's Boots. If you are an Argonian like Tooth-in-the-Sea, he will tell you that you do not need to do the test. Once three hours have passed, Tooth-in-the-Sea will approach you and agree to train you further in Alteration."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Ambush","Talk to Traven to receive your next assignment. Travel to the ruins of Silorn to meet the battlemages. Learn of the battlemages' strategy and prepare for the ambush. When the necromancers leave the ruins, attack them. Chase Falcar and kill him for his soul gem. Return to Traven with the gem.","Readying the Ambush[edit] Speak to Hannibal Traven to begin the quest, then travel to the ruins of Silorn southwest of the Imperial City and just southeast of Skingrad. Meet the three Battlemages (Iver, Merete, and the leader Thalfin) outside the ruins. They were supposed to storm the ruins but cannot—the door is magically sealed. Instead, they have decided to wait for the necromancers to come out and then attack. Ask the battlemages about their Abilities to figure out how best to arrange them. Thalfin will say:  ""I have to admit, I'm better with an axe than I am with magic. I've been working on spellcasting, but I still feel better with a weapon in hand."" Merete will say: ""Well, I excelled in my studies in magic, especially large-scale spells. I'm pretty accurate with them, too. More accurate than swinging a sword."" And Iver will tell you: ""I can manage with a weapon or with spells, but I've really been working on healing lately. I'm getting pretty good at it."" The optimal strategy is to place Thalfin and Iver up close, and Merete in the distance. Attack![edit] Once everyone is in position, speak with Thalfin. Note that if you get too close to the ruin entrance, the necromancers spot you and the element of surprise is lost. Eventually, Falcar, the former head of the Cheydinhal Mages Guild, and three necromancers exit the ruins and head towards you. Once close enough, join your allies in the attack. Falcar bolts for the ruins, and you can either chase him or help the battlemages deal with the remaining necromancers. Alternatively, you can sneak to the ruin entrance, encircle the ruins from the southern side and cut off Falcar's escape route. He won't fight back as he attempts to flee and if you manage to kill him before he gets to the ruins, you can simply take the soul gem and leave. Falcar will likely make it back to the ruins with the Colossal Black Soul Gem you are after, so follow him inside. It is a rather long path to find him, and filled with necromancers and their undead friends. Make your way to Silorn Sedorseli, and exit through the northernmost door back into Silorn. This gives you access to a button which opens the gates on the bridge to Silorn Buroseli, where Falcar is found. (Alternatively, you may be able to jump around the side of the gates instead.) Unlike the other necromancers in the area who tend to run around and make you chase them, Falcar charges straight at you and attacks aggressively with his dagger. He hits surprisingly hard and fast, so do not underestimate him. Kill him, loot the Colossal Black Soul Gem off his body and leave Silorn. Return Triumphant[edit] Return with the gem to Traven. If Traven mentions the Battlemages, choose the Black Soul Gem topic to complete the quest."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Amelion%27s_Debt","Talk to Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal to receive this contract. Visit Biene Amelion in Water's Edge to discuss her dilemma. Decide on the path of your adventure and provide Biene with the means to satisfy her debt. Return to Burz gro-Khash to receive your reward and further instructions.","An Amelion in Distress[edit] Visit Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal after completing Drunk and Disorderly for Modryn Oreyn. Burz has a contract for you from Biene Amelion in Water's Edge, a settlement north of Leyawiin on the western shore of the Lower Niben. Find Biene in her house or around the small settlement. It appears she has inherited a debt of 1000 gold from her father, who was recently dragged from the house in relation to the outstanding sum. Biene wants you to retrieve her grandfather's ceremonial sword  and cuirass - which are respectively enchanted with Frost Damage and Frost Shield - from the family tomb. She then plans to sell them to pay off the debt. At this point, you can approach the quest two ways. Option 1: Chivalrous (But Costly) Rescue[edit] If you have the inclination and the gold, you can immediately provide Biene with the funds necessary to pay off her debt. In thanks, she will give you permission to keep her grandfather's armor should you run across them later. Biene will also mark the location of her ancestor's tomb on your map. You must choose this option if you have already found and sold the sword and armor, as neither respawns. The two pieces that Biene wants you to retrieve have a base value of 1037 gold. Choosing this option is therefore inadvisable from a purely economic standpoint: to turn a profit on the item will require a very high mercantile skill. However, it may still be worth pursuing this option for other reasons, including: The armor is not only a unique set but also has a unique appearance. If you are a collector, or like to decorate your house, you will never have another chance to acquire any items that look like it. You can collect the armor at any time (including before this quest) without stalling the Fighters Guild questline. Option 2: Plundering the Tomb[edit] If you don't have the cash, or are looking for adventure, you can instead proceed to Amelion Tomb, which Biene will mark on your map.  It's located across the Lower Niben, southeast of Water's Edge. See the place page for full walkthrough information. For the fastest route to the items, at the first intersection take the southeastern tunnel and open the rock wall at E by pulling the nearby rope. After battling up to three enemies, use door D to enter the second zone: Sarcophagus Chamber. The first room can be quite tough, as you may find yourself fighting up to seven enemies at the same time. Once you've negotiated it, head up the tunnel to the final room where a boss-level Undead (B) is guarding the sword and armor (Q). Nearby you will also find Brusef Amelion's greaves (g), though these won't be of interest to Biene. Use the nearby door (C) to return to the first zone. You will emerge in a small room with a hole in the middle and a chest to the southwest. Just next to it and behind some Wisp Stalk plants is Brusef Amelion's Helmet (h), though this is also not of interest to Biene. Once you're done, drop down the hole and head outside. When you return to Biene, you are again given the opportunity to either give her money to pay the debt and keep the items, or to hand them over. Back to Cheydinhal[edit] Whatever your choice, return to Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal to receive a standard level-dependent gold reward and a one point Fame increase.  If you have already completed Den of Thieves, Burz will also promote you to the rank of Protector.  You will then have to go to Modryn Oreyn in Chorrol for your next quest, The Master's Son.  Otherwise, you will need to go to Azzan in Anvil to complete Den of Thieves next."

Meet a Guild contact and get a room for the night, where you are later contacted in order to devise an entrapment. Travel along the Gold Road until you are attacked by the Rogue Mage. Return to Carahil and inform her of the events to receive her recommendation.","Anvil Mages Guild[edit] Speak to Carahil at the Anvil Mages Guild to request a recommendation. Her task is to investigate a number of deaths along the Gold Road and put an end to it. You are to speak to Arielle Jurard at the Brina Cross Inn for more information on the matter. Before leaving, be sure to talk to Carahil once more - this time about the topic Rogue Mage - which will prompt Carahil to tell you the deaths on the road were caused by frost magic, and consequently give you three free Frost Shell scrolls, which do help as the rogue mage heavily utilizes frost magic. Arielle's Plan[edit] The Brina Cross Inn is along the main road a bit north of Anvil. Talk with Arielle, and she will suggest that you rent a room, posing as a traveling merchant. She will visit your room later. Christophe the innkeeper and possibly Caminalda, another customer, will ask you if you're a merchant. You can go along with Arielle and confirm to Christophe that you are a merchant, or say nothing. If you're playing the original Oblivion, you must confirm to Caminalda that you're a merchant or it can lead to a bug later in the quest. Once you've spoken with them, head to your room and wait for Arielle - she shouldn't be long. Speak with her once she enters. Then rest in the bed (waiting does not work); even though your journal tells you to sleep till morning, a single hour is enough. The Entrapment[edit] After your rest, leave the inn and travel east. Outside the house, Arielle and Roliand Hanus, another Battlemage, are already waiting and will follow behind you. When you are attacked, the two will come to your aid and hopefully deal with the threat. Avoid using a horse, since it will be too fast for the Battlemages to catch up to. You'll soon run into Caminalda standing in the road, who will confront and attack you (if you didn't tell her you were a traveling merchant you might have to talk to her to trigger the attack). You can easily anticipate her attack since she is marked by the Quest Marker. She won't last long against you and your entourage, but you may find it difficult to attack Caminalda without hitting either of the Battlemages (if one of the mages summons a creature, be sure you know who it belongs to). If you attack Caminalda before she turns hostile, it will count as a murder/assault, but no bounty will be incurred. She will be carrying some potions as well as a key for her room in the inn, where there is some gold. Return to Anvil and speak with Carahil, informing her the murders have been stopped (topic Rogue Mage). With this you'll receive your recommendation and a +1 increase in Fame."

Go to Bravil and talk to the beggars for information on Fathis Aren. Find and traverse the hidden passage from Fathis' room to his tower. Enter Fathis Aren's tower and steal the Arrow of Extrication. Go back to Ancrus' house in Chorrol and give the arrowhead to The Gray Fox.","Orders[edit] After you have fenced 700 gold and have completed the previous quest, Turning a Blind Eye, go to the Imperial City and wait for orders from the Gray Fox. Amusei should arrive shortly, and will give you orders to go to the house of Malintus Ancrus in Chorrol. You meet the Gray Fox once more, and he will tell you that you need to steal the Arrow of Extrication from the Court Wizard of Bravil, Fathis Aren. Once in Bravil, pay a beggar who tells you about Fathis Aren. You find out that Fathis keeps his most treasured items in a ruined tower outside of town. There may also be a secret passage from the castle to this tower. The Castle[edit] Head to the Castle in Bravil. Fathis' room is in the North Wing of the Castle. Getting into the North Wing might be tricky if you don't time it right, so wait until early morning when the guards change shifts, around 7:30am, to pick the lock and enter. Enter the chamber and look for the Arrow. More specifically, you only need to check the two chests that are to your left as you enter. Unfortunately, the arrow is not in either. You will then get a journal entry telling you to look for a secret passageway. One of the two pillars on the alcove straight across from the entrance of Fathis' room is the lever that opens up the secret passage to Bravil Wizard's Grotto. If you are in the Mages Guild, note that you can get kicked out for stealing items in this room. Passage to the Tower[edit] Bravil Wizard's Grotto and the subsequent Bravil Wizard's Lair are unusual dungeons, where you will encounter Conjurers, Dremora, and possibly Daedric creatures. There are several locked chests worth opening, and useful alchemical ingredients can be found in many places. Moving through the dungeon will also require unlocking some gates and doors, so bring your lockpicks. Or you may pickpocket Aren's Strange Key from Fathis Aren ahead of time if you wish. As you explore, you will eventually find a door that says it needs a key to be unlocked. There is in fact no key available to open this door. Instead the way through is an underwater passage found in the tunnel system. The underwater tunnel is quite deep, and traversing to the bottom will reveal the unique Giant Slaughterfish boss and a door leading out to the bottom of Niben Bay. However, the tunnel to the next zone is only partway down the cavern, and it is quite tricky to find. Of course, water breathing spells/potions will be helpful in navigating this area. For more information on these zones, see the place page. Fathis Aren's Tower[edit] In order to get out of the fort area, you need to take the arrowhead and Fathis' key from his chest, which is located in the same room as his lab is set up. The chest is unowned, so taking anything from it does not count as stealing. Most other things in the tower are marked as Fathis' property, however, and he will not be happy if you take them. To make matters more complicated, if he sees you, unless your disposition with him is 95 or higher, he will likely attack you on sight. If his disposition is higher than 95, you can easily walk past him to access the quest-related chest. Members of the Mages Guild need to be particularly careful not to be caught, as they will be expelled from the guild if they are. Higher ranked mages are likely to have an easier time taking the arrow since their allegiance with the Mages Guild will raise Fathis' disposition. Finally, if you kill Fathis during this stage, you will not incur the blood price, but you will get kicked out of the Mages Guild. Afterwards, make your way outside using the main door and return to the Gray Fox who will reward you with 500 gold and promote you to Master Thief. He will also tell you that you can now use Fathis Ules, the best fence in the guild, as your fence. Unfortunately, due to a bug, Fathis will not offer his services after completing the quest Sins of the Father, even if you returned the Honorblade of Chorrol to him. However, you can still invest in Fathis Ules as long as you are an Expert in Mercantile."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Assassin%27s_Gambit","Receive the contract and the arrow for the assassination. Eliminate Adamus Phillida. (Optional) Take his finger and place it in the desk. Return to Ocheeva to collect your reward.","The Assassin's Gambit[edit] The mini-quest to get your next contract from Ocheeva is named ""The Assassin's Gambit"". She tells you that you must kill Adamus Phillida, a recently retired Imperial Legion officer, who has taken up residence in the City Watch barracks in Leyawiin. For this task, you have been given an enchanted arrow called the Rose of Sithis. The Rose of Sithis is specially commissioned and crafted to kill one person--in this case, Adamus Phillida. When fired on anyone else, it only wounds them. If you can hit Phillida with the arrow when he is not wearing his armor, the strike will be fatal. Head to Leyawiin, stalk Adamus Phillida, and attack when the moment is right. The contract will be complete when Phillida is dead, whether you use the Rose of Sithis or not. When Adamus Phillida is dead, you can return to the Sanctuary for your reward. If you want to receive your bonus, however, there is one more task you must complete. Phillida wears an Imperial Legion ring. Take his finger, with the ring still attached, and put it in the desk of Phillida's Imperial Legion successor, in his office in the Imperial City. Making the Kill[edit] After you receive the quest from Ocheeva, travel to Leyawiin and head to the small pond. Every day at around 3-8pm, Adamus, accompanied by his bodyguard, will unequip his armor and take a swim in the pond. Wait for him to go into the water, then go into sneak mode and make sure you are not detected. Find a good spot, and shoot the Rose of Sithis at a part of his body that is sticking out of the water. You can also kill him using the Rose of Sithis while he's sleeping in the barracks, as he is unarmored then, as well. He will die instantly (even though it only counts as assault) and you can return to the sanctuary for your reward. It is very hard to avoid incurring a bounty from this kill, as there is a glitch that will get you 40 bounty even if you shoot him with the Rose undetected. You must kill him in one hit by any means to avoid a bounty. If you really want a challenge, one possible approach is to walk up to Adamus Phillida and inform him to his face what you're there for. This will result in every single guard in the city attempting to kill you. If this doesn't end with your death, it will probably end in a massive bounty. You should not do this unless you're high level and a member of the Thieves Guild. Loot the Finger[edit] Now, loot the finger from his body (along with a bunch of keys to various places) and head for Imperial City. Now enter the Prison District of the Imperial City, and wait for nightfall; just before 3am. There should be no guards in the office. Go into Sneak mode, and enter the Imperial Legion Offices (remember all the keys?). As previously mentioned, there shouldn't be any guards around so late at night, so head to the desk right by the entrance and pick the lock. Place the finger in the desk (by clicking on the desk and, within the inventory window, clicking on the finger; unlike some other quests, the quest item does not automatically get transferred for you). The chest to the left of the desk is known to have good treasures in it, so it would be a good idea to loot it while you are there. Head outside undetected, then head to the sanctuary for your reward and bonus. The reward for this quest is the standard 50-600 gold (level-dependent) reward given for each Dark Brotherhood quest. The bonus is an additional 500 gold."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Assassinated_Man","Receive Valtieri's final contract. Travel to Chorrol, and break into Francois Motierre's house. Learn of Motierre's plot to fake his death and wait for Hides-His-Heart to arrive. When Hides-His-Heart arrives, ""kill"" Motierre and flee. Revive Motierre in the Chapel Undercroft, and lead him to the local inn. Return to Valtieri to collect your reward, advance in rank, and change your Dark Brotherhood liaison.","To Serve Sithis[edit] ""Oh, you have been a naughty boy, Motierre, haven't you?"" Speak with Vicente Valtieri in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary to complete the ""To Serve Sithis"" mini-quest and receive Vicente's final contract. It seems Francois Motierre in Chorrol borrowed a lot of money from underworld types and has missed a payment. The lenders don't even want the money. They feel insulted and want him dead, sending an enforcer to kill him. Francois has hired The Dark Brotherhood to fake his death and take the life of his mother instead, a detail Vicente tells you has already been handled by Lucien Lachance. Vicente gives you the tools you'll need to fake Motierre's death: a single-use dagger coated with a special poison called Languorwine that can make it appear that a person has died, and an antidote to revive him later. Motierre's Plan[edit] Travel to Chorrol and break into Motierre's house in order to speak with him. His house is located just north of the Chorrol South Gate and is protected by a Hard lock. Once inside, Francois tells you that those he is indebted to have sent the enforcer Hides-His-Heart to kill him. He wants you to use the dagger Vicente gave you to slash him once, fooling the enforcer into believing he is dead. You are to then flee Chorrol without killing the enforcer. That way Hides-His-Heart will believe Motierre is dead and return to his organization and inform them that a Dark Brotherhood assassin got to Motierre first. You are to then wait a day, locate his ""body"" in the Chapel Undercroft and use the antidote to revive him. Death and Revival[edit] ""Oh my, Aunt Margaret! You are looking the worse for wear..."" Hides-His-Heart will arrive shortly. Play your part in the charade and slice Francois once with your poisoned blade. The poison will take effect immediately and Motierre will appear to die. Hides-His-Heart will attack you at once, but if you harm him in any way you will acquire a bounty. Instead of fighting, flee Chorrol immediately. Return in one full day, go to the Chapel Undercroft and administer the antidote (activate the ""corpse"" and it will be administered automatically). It seems that revival is something to which the other inhabitants of the Undercroft take offense, seeing it as a desecration. After you have revived Francois, three Motierre Zombies will attack you (one right next to you and two others). Keep Motierre alive, as this is the only Dark Brotherhood mission that can be failed. The zombies can be avoided, as they spawn once you first talk with the revived Motierre. If you back away from him as soon as you wake him up and get closer to the undercroft door, you can talk to him there and quickly leave. Back to Safety[edit] Kill or avoid the zombies and make your way to The Grey Mare Inn with Motierre so that he can buy passage out of Cyrodiil, then return to Vicente. If you successfully completed the quest, you will receive Cruelty's Heart, a leveled amulet that adds Willpower and Strength; advancement to Eliminator rank; and the Sanctuary Well Key. The key allows easier access to the Sanctuary via the well outside. If you kill Hides-His-Heart, fail to save Motierre, or kill Motierre, you fail this quest. You are allowed to proceed with the Dark Brotherhood questline, but there are negative consequences. Vicente's disposition will markedly drop (-71, instead of +80 for successfully completing the quest); this may result in him turning aggressive, so you may want to be prepared with Charm spells. You will also not receive 1 Infamy point for this quest. Additionally, several rewards will be delayed until the completion of the next quest, The Lonely Wanderer: he will not give you the well key, you will not gain the rank of Eliminator, and, if you are playing on Xbox 360, you will not obtain the achievement for the rank of Eliminator. Vicente will no longer be your liaison in the Brotherhood after this quest; instead, you will receive new contracts from Ocheeva."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Attack_on_Fort_Sutch","Note: This quest does not appear in your journal. At any time after completing Dagon Shrine, but before completing Light the Dragonfires, travel to Fort Sutch. You will find a group of soldiers battling Daedra in front of an Oblivion Gate. Help the soldiers defeat the Daedra. Close the Oblivion Gate.","Triggering the Quest[edit] Unlike most quests, this does not show up in your journal. The trigger for this quest is the delivery of the Mysterium Xarxes to Martin (part of the Dagon Shrine quest) and the subsequent opening of several Oblivion Gates across Cyrodiil. This particular gate opens at Fort Sutch, which is also the site of a Dark Brotherhood quest, Bad Medicine. The Path to Fort Sutch[edit] Fort Sutch is located north of Anvil. When leaving the main gate of Anvil, travel along the Gold Road until it begins to bear northeast; look for an unmarked road that branches off to your left and continue along it to the north. This road will lead to Lord Drad's Estate. Once you arrive at Lord Drad's Estate, the road will end; head north-northeast and continue through the countryside. As you start down the hillside, you will see the ruins of Fort Sutch and an Oblivion Gate to the northeast. Events at Fort Sutch[edit] When you approach Fort Sutch, you will encounter a group of Imperial Guards - including an Imperial Guard Captain - who will request your assistance in defeating the Daedra pouring out of the nearby Oblivion Gate. The final Daedra you will need to defeat will be a leveled Dremora, who will emerge through the gate as you approach it. When all the Daedra are defeated, return to the captain. Speak with him and he will tell you to close the gate if you wish, but informs you that he will be staying at Fort Sutch as per his orders. The Daedra may be a significant challenge, since they will greatly outnumber the Imperial guards. Eventually, once all the Daedra come swarming out, overwhelming the soldiers, one of the guards will scream ""There's too many of them!"" or ""We've got to fall back!"". Remember to come prepared if you want any of the soldiers to live. An alternative way to deal with the Daedra is to prevent them from spawning in the first place. If you avoid talking to anyone and sneak up on the gate from the east (using Invisibility helps), the Daedra will never go into attack mode. Immediately enter the gate and close it. When you return to the area after closing the gate, the only Daedra that you and the guards should have to face is the leveled Dremora and possibly a stray or two. This approach makes it much easier to keep the guards alive. The Gate[edit] Approach the Oblivion Gate and enter the Planes of Oblivion. You will be transported randomly to one of four Oblivion Planes (specifically Random Oblivion Worlds 2, 3, 4, or 7). Proceed as you have previously, find the appropriate tower and close the Oblivion Gate."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Azani_Blackheart_(quest)","Meet with Modryn Oreyn and speak about the Blackwood Company. Travel with Modryn to Arpenia and Atatar. Defeat Azani Blackheart. Return Blackheart's ring to Modryn.","Blackwood Company[edit] Modryn Oreyn wants you to meet him at his house after dark to discuss the Blackwood Company. However, you do not actually have to wait till night, as you can talk to Modryn about the Blackwood Company as long as he is in his house. He'll tell you how Vitellus Donton - Vilena Donton's son - was one of fifteen men who died when the Fighters Guild tried to retrieve the sword Sinweaver from Azani Blackheart in order to complete a contract for a mage named Argoth. The Blackwood Company then claimed that they completed the mission instead, simultaneously establishing their reputation as an alternative to the Fighters Guild and making the Fighters Guild look like incompetent cowards. However, Argoth was mysteriously killed shortly afterwards and Sinweaver went missing, leading Modryn to doubt the Blackwood Company's story. He suspects that - despite their claims - the Blackwood Company never killed Azani, but instead made a deal with him: they paid him part of the contract money to get the sword, and then told him where he could find Argoth to take his revenge and retrieve the sword. Modryn wants to investigate the situation, including possibly killing Azani Blackheart to prove that the Blackwood Company lied. If you accept Modryn's dangerous mission, he asks you to meet him at the Fighters Guild in Leyawiin and travel to Arpenia to find out what's going on. Arpenia and Atatar[edit] Modryn shows you the way to Atatar Once you arrive in Leyawiin, speak with Modryn and he'll accompany you to Arpenia, northeast of Leyawiin in the Blackwood region. He'll mark Arpenia on your map and you'll be able to immediately fast travel there. Enter the ruin and explore a bit then talk to Modryn, who will declare that Azani Blackheart isn't there - in fact, the place is deserted. The quest advance is actually triggered by standing within 200 feet of an invisible map marker (in the northeast room, shown at M on the Arpenia map). If you are having problems advancing the quest, stand at that point for a minute, then try talking to Modryn again. Modryn believes that Azani moved his base of operations to Atatar - a nearby Ayleid ruin. He suggests to search there and will lead the way himself. You can continue to explore Arpenia if you like, as Modryn will wait patiently for you, but apart from a few rats and Ayleid chests the place is empty. Although Modryn will slowly walk to Atatar, it's important you follow him rather than using fast travel or rushing ahead, because this may cause a bug. The location won't be marked on your map until you arrive and Modryn refuses to move unless you are close to him. Azani Blackheart[edit] Once you're both inside, he will become a follower again. Make your way through the first three zones, dispatching any bandits along the way (see the place page for more walkthrough info). Modryn will likely be unable to follow you past the Crumbling Bridge trap (I) in the second zone and will instead end up on the lower level of the room. You can follow him and use door F to the third zone or press on and use door E. These doors bring you to different levels of the third zone, which in turn give access to different doors (G and H) leading to the final zone. However, the final door you use is irrelevant, and if you enter through door F you can still access door G by jumping down from a balcony. If you lost Modryn to the trap and used door E, waiting for a while will usually ensure he finds you again. Head into the final zone and locate Azani. Beware, he is a skilled and powerful nightblade, so make sure to be fully prepared for the battle. Modryn won't be much help in fighting, but can be useful in distracting Azani. Azani wears Elven armor at all levels and wields Sinweaver, a unique sword with Drain Fatigue and Fire Damage enchantments. Once you've defeated him, make sure to loot his ring from his corpse, as it is required to complete the quest. Modryn Oreyn[edit] Speak with Modryn (either in Atatar or back in Chorrol, if you lost him and can't locate him) and he'll ask for Blackheart's ring as proof that the killing was done by the Fighters Guild. In exchange for it you will gain one Fame point and a promotion to Warder. After completing this quest you can head either to Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal to start The Fugitives or to Azzan in Anvil to start The Wandering Scholar. The order in which you complete these following quests does not matter."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Azura","Once you have reached level 2, travel to the Shrine of Azura and speak to Mels Maryon. Acquire one sample of Glow Dust to give as an offering to Azura. Approach the Shrine of Azura and offer the Glow Dust at dusk (5-7pm) or dawn (5-7am). Kill the former worshippers of Azura that are trapped inside of the Gutted Mine. Return to the Shrine of Azura to receive your reward.","Locate the Shrine of Azura[edit] Azura's Shrine is located far north of Cheydinhal, north and slightly east of Lake Arrius Caverns, and high up in the Jerall Mountains. The shrine can be accessed using an unmarked road. The location of this shrine can be marked on your map by any of several methods: Reading the book Modern Heretics, Speaking to Trayvond the Redguard in the Cheydinhal Mages Guild about ""Daedric cults"", Speaking to Ulene Hlervu of Castle Cheydinhal about ""Cheydinhal"" followed by speaking to her about ""Daedric shrines"", Speaking to Borba gra-Uzgash at Borba's Goods and Stores about ""Daedric shrines"" after having spoken to Ulene Hlervu about ""Cheydinhal"". An Offering to the God[edit] Travel to the Shrine of Azura and speak to Mels Maryon, one of Azura's many worshippers at the shrine. Raise his disposition to 50. He'll tell you that you need to provide Azura with an offering of Glow Dust (from Will-o-the-Wisps) at dawn or dusk. Details on where to find this ingredient are provided in the article on Glow Dust. In particular, if you have started the quest Blood of the Daedra, there are three special Will-o-the-Wisps that appear near Azura's Shrine (in the areas to the north and west of the shrine). These three are leveled and non-aggressive (at least until you attack them), so they are easier to kill than most Will-o-the-Wisps. Return to Azura's Shrine with a portion of Glow Dust for an offering between 5-7am or 5-7pm (dawn or dusk). Azura will say: I have seen your name, Traveler, and heard it whispered in twilight. I ask a service, which holds promise of fame and reward. Many years ago, five followers slew the vampire Dratik and its kin, but all were infected by the foul creature. Knowing their fate, they sealed themselves up in the vampire's lair. Their suffering weighs heavily on me. Travel to the Gutted Mine. The door will open to you. Bring the peace of death to my followers, and you shall earn my gratitude. The Task at Hand[edit] Travel to the Gutted Mine, which is a short distance away southwest of the shrine. Enter the mine (but beware of traps), and seek out the five vampires, called the Afflicted Brethren. Kill all five to release them from their suffering. The final two will be behind a rock that will move once you pull a rope on the ceiling beside it. Return to Azura's Shrine when you have defeated all five vampires. You can find a Worn, Faded Note on the body of the Orc vampire named Ghola gro-Muzgol that tells the story of the ill-fated worshippers. Although the note suggests that you should take it to Lady Azura, it is not actually necessary to complete the quest. (You can keep the note even after the quest ends; it won't be forcibly removed from your inventory when you return to Azura). Also, at the back of the final room in the mine, there is a niche hidden behind some ""loose planks"" that fall down when you push on them; check the locked boss-leveled coffin in the niche for treasure. You will likely contract Porphyric Hemophilia, which leads to Vampirism. If you do, you may want to know how to avoid becoming a full blown vampire. If you are having trouble defeating the vampires, you can use Fire Damage, since vampires have a 50% Weakness to Fire. Return to the Shrine[edit] Activate Azura's Shrine (at any time of day) to tell her of your success. Azura will extend her gratitude for freeing the spirits of her unfortunate followers. She will reward you with Azura's Star, and erect five candles on the rocks behind her shrine in memory of her followers. Thank you, mortal. Their spirits are free, and henceforth, above my shrine, five bright candles shall burn forever in memory of their sacrifice. For your service, take this token, that your deeds might be entered in the Book of Fate. Visiting and attempting to activate her shrine after her quest will have this message appear: ""Go! Follow my Star, do great deeds, and seek out your fate!"""

She asks you to kill the ailing warlord Roderick at Fort Sutch and gives you a bottle of poisoned medicine. Only by sneaking into the fort and replacing his medicine bottle with the poisoned one, while remaining completely undetected, will you receive a bonus. Two Paths[edit] The guards never sleep, so there is no best time to do the quest. Additionally, since Roderick, his four guards, and the medicine cabinet only appear after the quest starts, you cannot kill them beforehand. Finally, one-hit kills will not cause you to forfeit your bonus as long as you were not detected. At this point, you have two options on how to proceed in order to get the bonus. Quick and Quiet[edit] Travel to the fort, found north of Anvil. Enter through the main entrance, and proceed cautiously, as Gerard Melie can be found patrolling the initial area. After eliminating or sneaking past him, you have two choices to proceed: the main gate or the side gates. The large portcullis gate is simply opened by a nearby lever while the side gates require picking two locks. However, by taking this route, you are more likely to avoid the mercenary patrolling around the bridge. Whichever method you choose, you'll be on the upper level of the next room, and can proceed easily to the medicine cabinet. RemasteredOblivion Roderick on his deathbed Roderick on his deathbed Slow and Stealthy[edit] If you speak with Teinaava before leaving, you can learn about a secret entrance to the south-southeast of the fort. The fort appears to have previously had an abbey - while it is now in ruins, you can enter through what remains of the tower, and easily pass into the fort through some half-flooded tunnels. As Teinaava claims, the tunnels are unguarded and provide easy access to the fort. Be wary, however, of Laenafil, who is found patrolling the area you surface into. Thanks to the darkness of the tunnels and a convenient alcove halfway, even players with a low sneak skill should be able to pass unobserved. The recommended option, somewhat counter-intuitively, is to kill Laenafil (who is unleveled and has extremely low health) and take her key, which opens the gates on the upper level; rather than taking the unlocked path to the lower level of the room, which leads right to Ulmug gro-Cromgog and Neesha. If you opt for the low path, you can wait until they have finished their conversation and follow them to Roderick's quarters, where you will have a greatly-increased chance of being detected as a result; or slip by them with even just a few seconds of invisibility, giving you several minutes to do your work in peace. This is the main benefit to killing Laenafil, since if you take the upper path their conversation will not start until you pass above them, again making it possible to pull off the switch with no-one around. Just be careful not to run into them on your way out. Deadly Medicine[edit] The medicine cabinet is located in a brightly lit area, and is best approached from the right. Open the cabinet and take the medicine, replacing it with your poison. Backtrack to the exterior using any of the above routes and taking care not be seen. Report back to Ocheeva to receive your reward. Reward[edit] Return to Ocheeva for a level-dependent gold reward (up to 600 gold), a single Infamy point, and your bonus: The Deceiver's Finery, a leveled outfit that fortifies Speechcraft and Personality. This outfit is useful for the treasure hunt in the next quest."

You are sent to Berich Inian in the Chapel of Akatosh to collect the key to the guard house. Acquire the key, rally your new reinforcements, and make your way through the tunnels to get to the gatehouse and open the gates. Reach and storm the castle, clearing out the Daedra infestation. Find the count's corpse, and recover his signet ring. Return to Savlian Matius with news of the count's death and his ring to finish the quest, and receive your reward.","Make it to the Castle[edit] Whenever you're ready, speak to Savlian Matius to begin the battle to free Kvatch Castle. Follow him and any of the survivors from your efforts to the break the city's siege out of the chapel. Savlian is marked as essential, so he cannot be killed, but the rest of your allies are mortal and unleveled. Keeping them alive—although optional—is a challenge at high levels (see the Notes section for tips). After battling past three Daedra and a Dremora, Savlian and his men will reach the moat, only to find that the gate has been sealed. Savlian tells you that there is however an alternative route which runs underground from the northern guardhouse. Berich Inian holds the key and you are therefore sent back to the Chapel to retrieve it. Gatehouse[edit] When you return to the Chapel, you will meet reinforcements: two Imperial Legion Soldiers and one Imperial Legion Archer tell you that they saw the smoke from the Gold Road. Ask them to follow you, then talk to Berich. He will lead you into the Chapel Undercroft, where you will encounter four Daedra. At the far end of the Chapel Undercroft is a door leading back outside. Berich will lead you through the city streets, fighting past nine Daedra as you go, until you reach the ruins of the Kvatch Arena, which are guarded by a further two Daedra. Press on until you see the guardhouse to your right, dispatching the two Daedra and the single Dremora nearby. Once you're at the guardhouse, Berich will open a locked trapdoor with his key and depart, leaving you and your Imperial Legion soldiers to it. If Berich gets killed at any point on your way toward the gatehouse, you will have to loot the key to the trapdoor from his corpse and open the trapdoor yourself. The tunnel is straightforward and free of enemies. At the end, take the ladder up and into the gatehouse. On the upper level of the gatehouse is a turn wheel which opens the gates. Berich, Savlian and any remaining men will rush headlong into the courtyard and you will need to help them clear the area of another nine Daedra. Into the Castle[edit] Inside the Great Hall Once the courtyard is clear, Savlian will run into the castle. Approach him and he'll tell you to go find the Count of Kvatch while he takes care of the main hall, which contains another five Daedra. He and his soldiers will remain at the entrance to the throne room. Only the Imperial Legionnaires will follow you as far as the entrance to the next zone. Be sure to grab A Dance in Fire, v4—an Acrobatics skill book—from a table in the Great Hall (second zone) immediately to your right when entering. Fight your way through the Great Hall, past four Daedra and towards the north end, where there is a passage leading to the Count's bedroom, which hosts another Daedra. Count Ormellius Goldwine is dead in his chambers; there is no way to save him. When you find the count, a quest update will tell you to at least take his Colovian Signet Ring back to Savlian. Back in the main hall, inform Savlian of the Count's death to complete the quest. If you give him the ring, he'll give you his Kvatch Cuirass in return. The leveled light armor cuirass fortifies Strength and Endurance by two to eight points."

Return to Thorley with the fangs to be rewarded with a skill book.","Shardrock Farm[edit] When you first find Shardrock farm, you will meet the owner, Thorley Aethelred. He will tell you that bears have been attacking his sheep, and the fence that he constructed has not worked. Thorley asks you to kill the trouble-making bears and bring back their West Weald Bear Fangs. Troublesome Bears[edit] The only bears that count towards this quest are the local West Weald Bears. These are leveled bears that can be significantly more powerful than typical brown or black bears. Ten West Weald Bears exist in all, none of which respawn, and each of which has one fang. They are spread out in a rough circle around the farm: four to the north, three beyond the pond to the east, two to the south, and one among the rocks to the west of Shardrock. You only need to collect six fangs for this quest. If you collect extra bear fangs you can sell them, as they are not considered to be quest items, or keep them for your personal collection. It is important to take the bear fangs from the bears as soon as you kill them; if you later need to collect the bear fangs, the corpses may no longer be there, or it may be impossible to find them in the underbrush. You may want to stay close to Thorley, because he can get killed by a bear, effectively ending the quest. Reward Table[edit] When you return to Thorley with six sets of bear fangs, he will reward you with one of the six following skill books. Which one you receive is randomly determined, with an equal chance for each of the six books. The book you receive is determined at the moment when you talk to Thorley with the bear fangs.

The Lonely Guard[edit] The captain of the Chorrol guard, Bittneld the Curse-Bringer, seems to enjoy his work but isn't so keen on the town's female population. Ask him about Chorrol and he will tell you that although he thinks the women are ""fine-looking"", he also thinks they're snooty and not very nice.

When adventuring with Mazoga, note that she is not essential and may be killed at any time. Mazoga will loot Black Bows from corpses (she makes her intentions quite clear every time you talk to her), though she will only loot five bows during each hunt.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Blood_of_the_Daedra","Speak with Martin about finding Mankar Camoran; he needs four particular items, the first being a Daedric Artifact. Follow Martin's suggestions to learn more about Daedric Artifacts and their possible locations. The quest names one artifact in particular to find and retrieve; any artifact from a Daedric shrine will do, however. Give Martin the Artifact of your choice and give him more time to continue the translation of the Mysterium Xarxes.","Cloud Ruler Temple[edit] After learning about the impending attack on Bruma by the Mythic Dawn, speak to Martin about his progress on deciphering the Mysterium Xarxes. It seems in order to open a portal to Paradise, four items are needed. So far he has only determined what one of those items is: a Daedric Artifact. Blessings of the Fifteen[edit] Ask Martin about ""Daedric Artifacts"" and he will suggest you read Modern Heretics for more information. The book will be on the table Martin sits at while working. The book provides all the information necessary to get a Daedric artifact from Azura's Shrine (including a map marker for its location). If you've been focusing on the main quest so far, the quickest way to get to Azura's Shrine is to fast travel back to Lake Arrius Caverns and head cross-country from there. The page on Azura's quest describes what to expect once you reach the shrine. However, Azura is not the only option. There are 15 Daedric artifacts available in Cyrodiil, one from each of 15 Daedric Princes, and any of these artifacts will satisfy Martin's needs. Details on all of these quests are provided under Daedric Quests. Probably the most important thing to consider when choosing an artifact to use is whether or not you can use the item effectively. The full value of each individual artifact is determined by your own style, and an excellent sword that no blade-strong person would ever dream of parting with may just be the right choice for an archer or mace-fighter to sacrifice. That said, each artifact does have some consistent qualities that make it a good or terrible choice to sacrifice: Azura's Star: It is highly recommended that you DO NOT give up Azura's Star, as this item is much too useful to lose. It is essentially a reusable Grand Soul Gem and it becomes particularly valuable as you start to rely on enchanted weapons later in the game. Even if you have never trapped a single soul, it's worth keeping the Star for later. It will become extraordinarily useful. Replaceable by Grand Soul Gems, up to the point where either the supply of those or your patience runs out. Ebony Blade: An excellent blade for use against spellcasters, but not as effective against more mundane fighters, or monsters (who use powers that are immune to Silence). If you're on a witch-hunt, you will have to compare this with casting Silence or poisoning a weapon with a suitable concoction, and wielding instead a Daedric Longsword (24 damage to the Ebony Blade's 23) enchanted with a Sigil Stone (Absorb Health Sigil Stones are available as early as level 5 and absorb 10 points or more, with the highest, at level 17, absorbing 25; the Ebony Blade absorbs only 8 health). Goldbrand: A weapon with very high physical damage, rivaling that of the vaunted Umbra. Unlike Umbra though, this blade's enchantment inflicts further damage. If you're focused on longsword fighting, this is practically essential for your arsenal. A Daedric Longsword with a Fire Damage Transcendent Sigil Stone does 1 less physical and 3 more Fire Damage. Mace of Molag Bal: The Absorb Strength enchantment on the mace has no duration, making it wholly ineffective, and the low number of charges of Absorb Magicka make this a relatively poor weapon for actual use, even for a skilled Blunt user. A Daedric Mace does 1 less damage and the relevant Ascendent Sigil Stone absorbs ten times as much Magicka.  Oblivion Remastered addressed the lack of a duration on the Absorb Strength Enchantment, giving it a duration of 10 seconds. Masque of Clavicus Vile: If you do not intend to use Umbra, then the Masque of Clavicus Vile is an excellent choice to sacrifice, as it increases only your Personality, which is widely considered to be one of the least useful stats as Persuasion can be supplemented with an extensive array of aids including bribes, Charm spells, Fortify Personality and Speechcraft, both available in spell and potion form. Fortify Personality is available at Enchanting Altars, but not in Sigil Stones. Utterly replaceable (other than appearance) by the Helm of the Crusader - found in Knights of the Nine - which is more durable, lighter and adds 25 Personality instead of 20, although infamous characters cannot wear it and must complete the Pilgrimage again first. Oghma Infinium: The value of this artifact - especially when used by a high-level character - is almost beyond consideration. It offers you the opportunity to train your character beyond the conventional limits of skills and attributes and should be retained at the expense of any other artifact you have available. No comparable replacement. This item, however, is your failsafe should you no longer have access to any other item, as this item's quest cannot start until you have started this quest.  Oblivion Remastered it is possible to read the Oghma Infinium, and give it to Martin before it disappears from the inventory. This gives both the selected boon from the Oghma Infinium and progresses the quest. (Tested on PS5) Ring of Khajiiti: The 35% Chameleon and Fortify Speed by 10pts effects of the ring make this artifact valuable for Stealth-based characters; a Transcendent Sigil Stone can provide 30% Chameleon and surpass the ring's Speed boost with 12pts, but not both. Ring of Namira: This ring offers Reflect Damage 12% and Reflect Spell 10%. Potions can provide either effect at up to 24%, as do numerous other items, although the combination of the two qualities is uncommon (Mirror Shield is another instance). Sanguine Rose: This artifact can be a powerful weapon if used carefully, especially for a low-level character. However, it can also be a danger to the user. The Sanguine Rose summons a random Daedra next to your target, which usually attacks it. However, if you are standing nearby there is a chance it will attack you instead. At higher levels, it is entirely replaceable by - and unequivocally inferior to in many respects - Summon spells. Saviour's Hide: As a physical cuirass of Light Armor it is one of the best available, being only slightly less protective than Glass but one-fifth of its weight. If you are playing an Altmer, or you were born under the Apprentice birthsign it will help counter your weakness to magic. Compare its 25% magic resistance to a Sigil Stone's maximum of 20%. Incomparable weight for the protection. Utterly replaceable (other than appearance and weight) by the highest level version of Morag Tong Cuirass found in Mehrunes' Razor - which not only gives 25% magic resistance but also 25% resistance to normal weapons, adds 13pts of Agility and has slightly higher armor rating. Skeleton Key: Is extremely useful for anyone, since it gives you infinite tries to open a lock. For characters with sufficiently high magicka, Open spells may be an alternative. However, there is a bug associated with this artifact. Skull of Corruption: At best, you can make good use of this staff in a tight situation; it especially helps stand-back conjurers when facing magic-using NPCs. At worst, it is a very entertaining toy. If you can keep it, then keep it. No comparable replacement. Spell Breaker: An excellent shield, especially if you're going up against spellcasters. Even if you are unskilled in Heavy Armor, you can at least equip the shield to make use of its 30% Spell Reflection, whether they have an accompanying weapon or not. Not a wise item to give up, as long as you can shoulder the weight. As with Ring of Namira, Reflect Spell can be provided with potions. Volendrung: As one of the few weapons with a Paralyze enchantment, Volendrung has its strengths. But, as the heaviest artifact around, only a skilled Blunt fighter won't mind carrying it everywhere. Neither Sigil Stones nor the Enchanting Altar offer the Paralyze effect, but there are five Oblivion and three Shivering Isles ingredients available to make such a poison. Wabbajack: When successfully struck, a target - no matter how damaged - is transformed into one of eight random creatures at full health, from a Rat all the way up to an Ogre. After ten seconds, the target reverts back to its original form, fully healed. Available at level 2, and the quest to obtain it is relatively easy. Lightweight. No equivalent replacement. Not a good weapon for low level characters. However, the Wabbajack is actually quite useful to you if you can kill any creature it summons within ten seconds and more easily than the enemies normally faced. It can be considered a form of crowd control when fighting Ogres, Gloom Wraiths or Goblin Warlords, as there is a 90% chance it will summon something weaker than an Ogre. Mysterium Artifact[edit] Finding the other Daedric shrines is generally not easy: as suggested by Modern Heretics, the shrines are remote and few people know of their existence. Which artifact to obtain for Martin is entirely up to you. One key factor is your level: each quest has a minimum level requirement, ranging from 2 to 20 (Azura and Sheogorath are the only quests available at level 2). Another key factor will be which artifact you think is least useful for you. All the Daedric artifacts have unique magical powers, including capabilities that are not otherwise available. The artifact you give to Martin will be destroyed and gone for good. Once you obtain a Daedric artifact, return to Martin and give him the artifact. Martin tells you he needs more time to continue translating the Mysterium Xarxes and tells you to speak with Jauffre in the meantime."

To complete it, you just need to accept the contract from Vicente. A Regular Routine...[edit] Once you accept the contract, Vicente will tell you what needs to be done: ""As I expected. Good. The target is a Wood Elf named Baenlin. You will find him at his home in Bruma. Enter secretly and avoid his manservant, Gromm. On the second floor is a secreted door leading to a crawlspace. Inside are the fastenings of a mounted head that hangs over Baenlin's favorite chair. Loosen the fastenings any night between 8:00 pm and 11:00 pm, and the head will surely fall on Baenlin as he relaxes in his chair, as is custom. If Baenlin is killed in any other manner, or if the manservant Gromm is killed, you will forfeit the bonus. Now go, and may Sithis be with you."" You are now directed to go to Bruma and kill the target Baenlin in his own home. If you speak to Gogron or Teinaava before you leave, they will also provide an insight on his manservant, Gromm: ""The manservant's name is Gromm, you say? Sounds like a Nord. Probably a big one. If he catches you, get ready for a serious fight."" and ""If the target is old and weak, as you say, then his manservant is sure to be quite the opposite. Best to stay out of his way."" ""...and the head will surely fall on Baenlin as he relaxes in his chair, as is custom."" ...Goes Horribly Wrong[edit] When you arrive in Bruma, Baenlin's house is located just north of the eastern gate. If you spoke to Antoinetta beforehand, she'll give you some advice about how to enter the house: ""How do you plan on entering this man's house? Through the front door? Be smart and look for a more inconspicuous way in, like a cellar entrance."" Following her suggestion, you can find a door leading into the basement situated at the rear of the house, providing a safe and indirect access. Once inside the house, sneak upstairs, enter the room closest to the stairs, and proceed into the crawlspace through the door hidden in the wall. The precarious fastenings are at the end of the crawlspace, but remember Vicente's directions: ""Loosen the fastenings any night between 8:00 pm and 11:00 pm, and the head will surely fall on Baenlin as he relaxes in his chair, as is custom."" Wait until it is between those times before you release the mounted head, which will fall on Baenlin in his seat, killing him instantly. A Deadly Advancement[edit] Sneaking out the same way you came, you will notice Gromm standing in front of Baenlin's dead body. Be careful not to attract his attention as he will now attack you on sight. Retreat through the basement and out into Bruma, then return to the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary. Valtieri will comment on your completion of the contract. If you killed Baenlin in the manner requested, he will say: ""So, the accident has been staged, and Baenlin lies dead. Well done! You have more than earned your reward and bonus."" However, if you completed the mission in some other way, he will be disappointed: ""Baenlin is dead, yes, but you did not fulfill the contract precisely as directed. I will grant your reward of gold, but the bonus is forfeit."" He will then reward you with a leveled amount of gold (up to 600 gold) and an advancement to Slayer. If you successfully made Baenlin's death seem like an accident, you will receive the bonus reward Sufferthorn. You can now accept the next quest from Vicente, and the quest Scheduled for Execution will begin."

A Journeyman in Hand to Hand can use their fists to kill the ethereal undead. You will also encounter several Undead Blades. The first one will turn into the Ghost of Rielus once you defeat it. Rielus tells you that he was one of four Blades sent to the catacombs by Tiber Septim to discover the source of the evil infestation. The four were captured by the Underking Zurin Arctus, and bound to haunt the catacombs after death. A spell was also put on the passage to the tomb where the armor lies. Approaching it is impossible without freeing all of the Blades. You will take constant Frost Damage, be hit with the ""Breath of the Underking"" which drains Speed and Willpower, and finally hit an invisible barrier at the end of the corridor. Free the Undead Blades[edit] The Armor of Tiber Septim in front of the tomb of Reman III Rielus tells you to find and free his three companions so the four of them can undo the curse placed on the Shrine by the Underking. Another Undead Blade can be found in the Catacombs, another in the Hall of Judgement, and the last in the Prison; killing them will release the ghosts of Alain, Casnar and Valdemar respectively. Note that each of the four Blades has a leveled magical item (Amulet of the Ansei, Valdemar's Shield, and two swords: Mishaxhi's Cleaver and Northwind). In the prison area you need to open a locked door: either unlock it yourself or kill the undead Warden Kastav for his key. When you have freed all four, proceed into the Tomb of the Reman Emperors to observe them restoring the shrine. Once the evil enchantment has been dispelled, go and get the Armor of Tiber Septim. Return to Martin[edit] Return the armor to Martin in Cloud Ruler Temple. He will thank you and let you know he's discovered the third ingredient. You may notice that Martin has set up another table in his impromptu study area while you were gone. There are two skill books (The Refugees, Light Armor and The Doors of Oblivion, Conjuration), a third non-skill book (The Firmament), an apprentice calcinator, and two paint brushes."

Recover the Bloodworm Helm and return it to Traven.","Discord in the Council[edit] Talk to Arch-Mage Traven once you have been promoted to Wizard. He will tell you that the council is divided on the issue of how to deal with Mannimarco, and as a result, the last two artifacts that were known to belong to the Worm King, the Necromancer's Amulet and the Bloodworm Helm, were taken away from the Imperial City by Caranya and Irlav Jarol, respectively. However, having continued misgivings about the safety of the items and their current caretakers, he wants you to retrieve the items back to the University for safekeeping. Being approximately equal in ease and difficulty, length and reward, and being unable to proceed until both are completed, there is no clear advantage of doing one or the other first and so the choice of which to complete first and which to complete second is up to you. Fort Teleman[edit] Travel to Fort Teleman northeast of Leyawiin. You'll find the place full of necromancers, which is probably not good news for Irlav. Continue on to the Order of the Black Rose area. As soon as you enter the Black Rose area you should find a few necromancers fighting with a number of Daedra. If you stay hidden they will fight among themselves. If they spot you, however, they will all likely try to attack you. This does however, provide a nice opportunity to test the Wizard's Fury spell, obtained from the previous quest. At the end of the Black Rose section you'll find the body of Irlav Jarol with the Bloodworm Helm still on him. Return to Traven[edit] Swipe the helm, and make your way out of the fort. Return the Bloodworm Helm to Traven, then, as usual, speak to Raminus Polus for advancement to the next rank if you have already also completed The Necromancer's Amulet."

Win the tournament, and return to the Shrine of Boethia for your reward.","Locate the Shrine of Boethia[edit] Travel to Boethia's Shrine, located southeast of Cheydinhal in the Valus Mountains. The location of this Shrine can be marked on your map by any of several methods: Reading the book Modern Heretics Reading the book The Refugees Speaking to Borba gra-Uzgash in Cheydinhal about ""Daedric Shrines"" Speaking to Ulene Hlervu about ""Cheydinhal"" Boethia will open the way An Offering to the God[edit] Travel to the shrine of Boethia and talk to Haekwon, one of Boethia's worshippers. He will tell you to present Boethia with a Daedra heart. Acquire a Daedra heart, return to the shrine, and activate it. Boethia will say: Why do you summon me? You are not one of my faithful. Do you hope to be counted among my Chosen? Then prove yourself to me, mortal. I shall open a portal for you to one of my realms in Oblivion. Go, and take your place in my Tournament of Ten Bloods. Survive, and you will be rewarded. Fail, and your soul belongs to me. After the dialogue, a blue portal will appear nearby. When you are ready, activate it to be transported to the arena. The Task at Hand[edit] Boethia, the lord of deceit... and games You will arrive in the stadium where the Tournament of the Ten Bloods takes place. You'll need to fight nine rounds against Boethia's Chosen, one at a time. You will take the place of whichever Champion would have shared your race. Be prepared; these characters are armed to the teeth with dozens of potions, weapons, powerful ranged attacks, and will often heal themselves. You will be unable to leave until all of them have been defeated. While you're battling, watch out for the lava: there's no fence to protect you (but you can certainly feel free to use this to your advantage by chasing your enemies into the lava). When you are ready to fight the next opponent, approach the gates to the right. These open before you reach them, so be prepared. Unlike the gladiator battles in the Arena, there are no rules about looting the corpses of your fallen opponents. Make sure you pillage the bodies of the fallen for some nice leveled weapons, enchanted arrows, armor and tons of potions. You don't have to pillage until all battles are completed because the corpses never disappear. Boethia will make a comment before and after you fight each of the Champions: ""Beyond this gate is my Argonian challenger. She is a clever thing, and eager for your blood.""

""Your High Elf opponent is cool and confident. Go! Let the contest begin."" ""With his keen mind and eyes, the Imperial measures you. Give him what he seeks."" ""My Khajiit is quick and cunning! Go! Seek him out! See whose blood is quicker."" ""This Nord is an animal... a glorious beast. Watch her teeth... she bites!"" ""The gate is open. Go forth and greet my Chosen Orc."" ""Greet the war-hardened Redguard! Fight for my glory, Chosen One!"" ""Through the gate, my Wood Elf waits! Hurry, and do not disappoint me."" ""How sad. The Argonian was a poor thing. Let her go."" ""What a pity. For the Breton, it is over."" ""A valiant effort, Dark Elf, but take comfort. Your spirit is mine."" ""The price of failure? A final fanfare for the High Elf. Farewell."" ""No. I'm afraid this Imperial was not the one."" ""Another one bites the dust. The Khajiit is done."" ""I must confess... that Nord was a disappointment."" ""Alas, poor Orc. This was not your finest hour."" ""In the scales of testing, Redguard, you are tried and found wanting."" ""Alas for the honor of Valenwood, the Wood Elf has fallen."" When you have defeated your final opponent, a portal appears back to the realm of Cyrodiil and Boethia will salute your skill. ""The others are dust! You alone, [Player Race], remain, First and Last! Beyond the next gate, your portal waits."" Activate it to return to Tamriel once you have looted the corpses of your opponents to your heart's desire. If you want to bring back more items than you can carry, pile them up by the entrance and pick them all up when you decide to leave. You can still travel through the portal if you are overencumbered.

Uncover the truth about Springheel Jak. Defeat Jakben and retrieve the Boots of Springheel Jak.","The Gray Fox[edit] After you have fenced 800 gold worth of stolen goods, Thieves Guild messenger Amusei actively seeks you out, reporting that the Gray Fox will be waiting for you at Ganredhel's house in Cheydinhal. The Gray Fox tells the tale of a famous thief, Springheel Jak, who died 300 years ago and was put to rest still wearing his enchanted boots. He then asks you to locate Jak's final resting place and retrieve the boots. The only known descendant of the famous thief is The Earl of Imbel, who goes by the name of Jakben and lives somewhere in the Imperial City. The Gray Fox finally tasks you to locate the Earl and search his house for clues. Search for the Earl[edit] Jakben's house in the Imperial City As always, the eyes and ears of the Gray Fox will help you out and map markers pointing to them will be added to your in-game map. Travel to the Imperial City and speak to any of them who will provide the information you want: ""The Earl of Imbel has a home in the Talos Plaza, on the inner wall. He is an odd one. Keeps to himself mostly. Only goes out after dark. A real night owl."" A second source is harder to find but is also more informative. On Sundas, Tirdas and Turdas, a man named Gemellus Axius roams around the Market District between 8am and noon. Speak to him and it turns out that he is the Earl's manservant. He will provide the same location info as the beggars but will also provide some suspicious info: ""He is a very private man and does not leave his home often. He has a rare skin condition that forces him to sleep during the day."" Travel to the Talos Plaza District and locate the large mansion described by the citizens. It is placed between Umbacano Manor and the Tiber Septim Hotel. Searching the Mansion[edit] Note: Due to a bug that causes Jakben to skip his sleep during the day, this next section is much more complex than intended. The front door of the mansion will always be locked with a hard lock and it is difficult to know beforehand when it is safe to enter. Jakben himself will take an evening stroll for four hours at 10pm on Morndas, Middas and Fredas, and manservant Gemellus Axius will go to bed at that time, so that is your cue. At 10pm, watch Jakben leave the house, then pick the lock and enter. The Gray Fox told you to look for clues, so head upstairs and locate the dining area. A staircase will lead you to Jakben's study, so head up there and examine the desk. In there, you will find a book entitled Imbel Genealogy which is the only clue available, but is of no help. You need to face Jakben himself for more information. Jakben, Earl of Imbel[edit] Whether or not you found the Imbel Genealogy, you will have to face Jakben and ask him about his ancestors' tomb. At this point it is possible to ask his manservant about the tomb as well, and he will reveal a bit of information about the family crypt: ""Only the Earl has a key. I have been warned never to enter it, on pain of death."" Time to chat with the Earl himself; with the exception of the above mentioned times, Jakben will be strolling around the second floor of the mansion, at times visiting his study. When you approach him, the esteemed nobleman turns out to be a coward: ""What do you want? I'll do anything you ask!"" When asked about Springheel Jak's tomb, the scared Earl hands you the key to the crypts with the words: ""The family crypts are under the house. They give me the creeps. I have the key. Take it. Just don't hurt me!"" The Earl will then seek shelter in his study, wondering why he is still alive. The Family Crypt The Catacombs[edit] With the key in hand and the Earl trembling in his study, it is time to head down into the basement and explore this ""creepy"" crypt. Before doing so, make sure you have the Skeleton Key or a healthy number of lockpicks in your inventory as you will face a good number of locked doors on your way. Alternatively, you could pick pocket Gemellus while he's sleeping and grab the house key, which will unlock all but two doors. Pick the eastern basement door and head downstairs. Pick another door open and approach the Wood Door to Catacombs with the key given to you by the Earl. Upon entering, it becomes apparent that something is seriously wrong with the crypt underneath the mansion, as the place is crawling with leveled vampires, who will all attack you on sight. The Crypt, entitled Catacombs on your map, is actually a semi-large cave filled with treasure and leveled enemies and you will have to face a long and exhausting battle before you reach Springheel Jak's Coffin in the far eastern area. The cave itself is fairly linear so just keep heading east and fight any vampire you meet, and wait for them to unlock the doors for you. Keep your eyes on the prize until you reach a wooden door in the far eastern section. Use your lockpicking skills one last time and you will locate Springheel Jak's Coffin in the last room. Springheel Jak[edit] Pry open the coffin and search through it, only to find out that there are no boots to be found. Instead, pick up the Diary of Springheel Jak and read it. Oddly, the diary is written by Jakben himself; he claims to be the famous thief who died 300 years ago, but obviously didn't due to vampirism. He also hints at a former friend who dared to steal from Nocturnal. You barely get the chance to close the book, before Jakben comes rushing in, now wearing a fully leveled suit of light armor, attacking you with an equally leveled, and possibly enchanted, long blade. You will have no choice but to fight back. When all is said and done, search Jakben's corpse and find the Boots of Springheel Jak. For some, you may have to travel all the way back to the Dining Room area before Jakben attacks you. You can also charm him and then steal the boots off him without killing him. Time to leave the mansion and return to the Gray Fox. Capital![edit] You will find the Gray Fox in his chair back in Cheydinhal, trying his best to avoid Ganredhel's two dogs, Daisy and Luna. When you hand him the boots he will be overwhelmed with joy as he can see his master plan fall into place; ""Capital! This may be the last piece of the puzzle."" He then hands you 500 gold, hints that he will contact you again and suggest you both leave Ganredhel's house. Finally, the newest edition of the Black Horse Courier reveals that Jakben's manservant Gemellus Axius finally gave in and reported the crimes of his master to the City Watch."

Varon Vamori[edit] Varon is either in the guild, at home (north of the guild hall), in the chapel, or in Silverhome on the Water. Confront him about Ardaline; he'll readily admit anything as long as his disposition towards you is at least 65. Once his disposition is high enough, he'll admit that he took her staff and sold it to Soris Arenim in the Talos Plaza District of the Imperial City.

Raise his disposition up to around 70 or so and he'll hand over the staff for a little cash (200 gold). Alternatively, you can talk to Soris's wife, Erissare Arenim: with a sufficiently high disposition she'll reveal that the staff is in a chest (although it is actually kept in a set of drawers) in the basement, and that the key is in his desk (upstairs), although the chest can simply be picked or opened by an Open Lock spell. You can also choose to pickpocket the key from either Soris or his wife in order to open the chest. Note that Soris and Erissare will wander around the ground floor and near the door to basement at all times except when they are sleeping. Return with the staff to Kud-Ei to earn her recommendation as well as a spell, Captivate. Be aware that the more-effective, lower-Magicka Beguiling Touch spell is available from Delphine Jend, also in the Bravil Mages Guild.

Savlian is too busy killing the Daedra outside the Oblivion Gate to aid in your quest, so your only choice is to offer to help him close it. Tell him you want to help, get ready for battle, and activate the gate. After entering the gate, you will find yourself in the Deadlands, Mehrunes Dagon's Plane of Oblivion, and specifically the Kvatch Oblivion World. See the place page for a full walkthrough, including optional areas. As the War Gates on the bridge in front of you are closed, head instead to the southwest. You will immediately come across Ilend Vonius fighting a number of Daedra, though at higher levels he may die before you manage to reach him. After the battle, Ilend will tell you he was sent in with a few other soldiers to close the Oblivion Gate. The only other survivor from the assault was taken as a prisoner to the large tower visible in the distance behind the War Gates. At this point, you can ask Ilend for help, or you can send him back to Kvatch and try to close the Oblivion Gate by yourself. If you ask him for help, he will become a follower and will back up your attacks with his sword and shield, while also healing himself relatively quickly.

Climbing the Tower[edit] RemasteredOblivion Menien Goneld inside his cage Menien Goneld inside his cage Your destination is the largest tower (the Sigil Keep) at the far northern end of the world, so continue heading north along the path hugging the western side of the island. After battling past a number of Daedra, turn right after finding some Fleshy Pods and take the western path straight to the main tower, ignoring the satellite towers. This route should allow you to avoid enemies and bypass any land mine traps. Enter the Sigil Keep of this world, known as The Blood Feast. After battling past two Daedra, take either of the doors leading to the Rending Halls, where you will find two more enemies and doors taking you back to the second level of The Blood Feast. Make your way up the tower and use either of the two doors leading to the Corridors of Dark Salvation. After dispatching another two enemies, you'll find that two of the three doors nearby are locked, so instead use the third door, which leads you outside to a bridge connecting The Blood Feast to the satellite tower Reapers Sprawl. At the top of Reapers Sprawl you will find Menien Goneld, the sole other survivor mentioned by Ilend Vonius, locked in a cage and guarded by a Dremora Sigil Keeper. The Dremora will say: ""You should not be here, mortal. Your blood is forfeit, your flesh is mine!"" before attacking you. Kill the Sigil Keeper to loot his key. Menien will provide you with some crucial information to guide your next steps: you must travel to the top of The Blood Feast, find the Sigil Stone and remove it, thus closing the Gate. Head back to the Sigil Keep and use your newly-acquired key to open the northern door. After negotiating a Citadel spike trap and another enemy, take the nearby door to the fifth level of The Blood Feast. Dispatch a Dremora Mage, then use the Runed Portal to teleport to the sixth level. Keep climbing until you reach the highest level, guarded by two more enemies, and use either door to enter the final zone: the Sigillum Sanguis. Climb up the ramps to the higher level, where you will face two Dremora, one of which is boss-level. Hovering in the middle of a pillar of light is a glowing sphere: this is the sigil stone that holds open the gate to Oblivion. Activate it, and the tower will start to collapse around you, before you will be teleported back to outside Kvatch.

When you're ready, follow him and the other soldiers into the city and help him fight off the five enemies occupying the main plaza in front of the chapel. If you told Ilend to leave, he will join his fellow guardsmen in the counterattack. Once the enemies are all dead, Savlian will walk to the chapel to make sure the civilians inside are alright. At this point, you can either escort Martin to Weynon Priory (provided you have started Find the Heir) or help Savlian reclaim Kvatch in an optional quest."

Many point to Olav's Tap and Tack. After attempting futilely to speak to Dralas, talk to Olav to be given a key to Dralas' room, where you find his diary. Give the diary to Carius, who points you toward Boreal Stone Cave. Travel there quickly, as you only have one day to finish the quest. Kill Raynil, and take his keys to recover the Mundane Amulet from the waterlogged chest. Take the amulet back to Erline to reveal its true nature; you may keep the amulet as your reward.","Rumors of a Vampire[edit] There is a rumor in Bruma about Raynil Dralas, who claims that he is a vampire hunter. You also learn that he has already killed an alleged vampire in town, a local man named Bradon Lirrian. Lirrian's House[edit] Damning evidence, or part of a cover-up? Head to Lirrian's house behind the right side of the Chapel of Talos. Inside, you will find two guards and Lirrian's wife. After some persuasion (minimum disposition 70), the investigator, Carius Runellius, will tell you that several bodies with bite marks in their necks were found recently. Luckily, a Dunmer vampire hunter, Raynil Dralas, turned up and found the vampire, who turned out to be Bradon Lirrian. The guards investigated his claim, and it seems the townsfolk have only seen Bradon out at night. Furthermore, a murdered beggar was discovered in the basement of his house. After you talk to Carius, a conversation with the widow, Erline Lirrian, reveals that Bradon had to work during the night, which explains why he had to sleep during the day. She also believes that the body was intentionally placed in the basement to frame her husband. Erline implores you to clear his good name.  Olav's Tap & Tack[edit] Speak to the townsfolk again, and they will tell you that Dralas is staying at Olav's Tap and Tack. Speaking with Olav will provide additional information. With a little persuasion, Olav tells you that he knew Bradon and had actually seen him during the daytime, thus lending credence to the fact that he was not a vampire. He then gives you the key to Dralas' room in the hopes you will find something to clear Bradon's name. Alternatively, you can pickpocket the key off of him. In the room, you find a diary called Gelebourne's Journal behind a chest of drawers, which details how Bradon, Raynil, and a man named Gelebourne were part of an adventuring group. It gives their account of how they explored some ruins and found a magical amulet which they then hid in a cave near Bruma. It becomes obvious that Raynil has been killing off his partners in order to keep the treasure for himself. Take the diary so you can give it to Carius as evidence of Bradon's innocence. Boreal Stone Cave[edit] Raynil: traitor, bogus vampire hunter, assassin and general troublemaker Return to Lirrian's house and speak with Carius. He will accept your evidence and tell you to meet him at the Olav's Tap and Tack in one hour, after he talks to the guards about apprehending Dralas. When you meet him again, Carius will tell you that he had Dralas followed. The ""vampire hunter"" was seen heading west, towards Boreal Stone Cave, which seems to match the description of the cave the amulet was hidden in. Carius then asks you to catch Dralas, stating that you have but one day to do so. He'll mark the location on your map. Travel to the cave quickly, and inside you'll find Raynil, who will refuse to surrender. Dispense justice upon him, take the three keys from his corpse, and recover the artifact, a Mundane Amulet, from the ""waterlogged chest"" nearby. There are also some other chests nearby and very little else in this cave. Return to Bruma and speak with Erline to have the mundane amulet's true nature revealed. She tells you that Bradon cast a spell on the amulet to prevent the other two members of the brotherhood from gaining its power should they betray him, because he did not trust them. He told Erline that she should only tell them how to lift the spell if she is on her deathbed, and he is already dead. The events of this quest show that his distrust of Raynil, at least, was justified. Ironically, Erline demonstrates that the spell is lifted by a secret word: ""Brotherhood"". The mundane amulet is revealed to be the leveled amulet Phylactery of Litheness which fortifies your speed. It is your reward. Unlike other quests, you actually have a time limit in this quest. If you do not go to the cave within 24 hours after Carius tells you to go there, Raynil will escape to Morrowind and you'll receive no reward."

You may find a lone guard fighting daedra along the way. You may enlist his help or order him to flee. There are various daedra scattered about along with some treasure and plants. Once you reach the tower, go inside and make your way to the top. The guards will likely be of good assistance to you providing you can keep them alive. Burd is flagged as essential so he will only become unconscious. Your companions will charge an enemy as soon as it spots you or you attack it. Rest in safe areas to heal the guards as needed. They will also tend to get in the way of your attacks but don't seem to mind being hit a time or two (Warning: If you hit them a third time, they will turn on you. Simply yield to them and they should stop attacking.) If you land the killing blow on a guard, you will receive the usual bounty of 1000 gold for murder, but the remaining guards will not try to arrest you until you come back to Bruma. Your disposition with Burd will also fall to zero. Assaulting the Sigillum Sanguis[edit] Near the top of the Sigil Keep, you will encounter a Sigil Keeper (he is no tougher than the daedra you have already encountered). Take the Sigil Key from him or pick the lock on the door that leads to the Sigillum Sanguis. Be warned that there is a small concentration of daedra guarding the Sigil Stone. Note that if you brought Burd into the gate with you, he must be present in the Sigillum Sanguis for you to remove the stone. If you told him to wait or left him far behind, you will have to go back and find him. Back in Bruma[edit] Once the gate has been closed and you are back in Bruma, talk to Captain Burd again. He says that he thinks he can handle any more gates that open around Bruma. Return with the news of your success to Jauffre. Speak to Jauffre for an optional sidequest (Allies for Bruma), or speak to Martin to continue with the main quest."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Bruma_Recommendation","Speak with the leader of the Bruma Mages Guild, Jeanne Frasoric. She needs help in finding a mage who has been missing for days. Either look for J'skar by yourself or get help from Volanaro, his mischievous friend. Tell Jeanne Frasoric that you have found J'skar to obtain her recommendation.","Bruma Mages Guild[edit] Talk to Jeanne Frasoric in the Bruma Mages Guild. She will request that you find J'skar -  a missing mage who hasn't been seen in days. If you can find him, you'll have your recommendation from her. There are two possible ways to accomplish this quest. Working with Volanaro[edit] Talk to Volanaro, also in the guild hall. If his disposition towards you is at least 70, Volanaro will agree to help you find J'skar if you help him play a prank on Jeanne. He wants you to steal Jeanne's Manual of Spellcraft from her desk upstairs. He'll even teach you the Minor Latch Crack spell (a more efficient version of Open Easy Lock). Go upstairs to Jeanne's room, unlock her desk, and steal the Manual of Spellcraft from it. Jeanne's copy of this book is unique; other versions of the book will not work for the quest. Be sure you are not caught taking the book, or else you will be suspended for stealing from the guild. Return the book to Volanaro who will tell you to meet him in the living quarters after 10pm. Wait or return around 10pm to the living quarters downstairs. Find Volanaro in his room and speak to him. Once you're ready, ask him about J'skar. In a flash, J'skar will appear before you. Apparently the two were just having some fun with Jeanne, and he was invisible all along. Report to Jeanne that you've found J'skar in order to receive her recommendation. If you want to get the Minor Latch Crack spell without pranking Jeanne, just agree to Volanaro's plan, don't steal anything, and then follow the walkthrough below to find J'skar yourself. Even if you don't steal Jeanne's book after receiving the spell, Volanaro will still remark on how great the prank went. Searching for J'skar on your own[edit] The easiest way to find J'skar is using Detect Life and looking for the only purple glow not associated with any visible person. J'skar is most likely to be in the basement. You may also bump into an invisible barrier from time to time, and the tool-tip at the bottom of the page will tell you it is J'skar. If you speak to him while he is under the Chameleon effect, J'skar will say, ""Shhh! Go away! You'll ruin everything!"" Once you have found J'skar, cast Dispel on him and he will reappear. The apprentice-level spell Dispel Other can be purchased from Alves Uvenim in Leyawiin; at journeyman level in Mysticism, Volanaro can sell you the Greater Dispel Other spell. If you are not able to cast a spell, you can instead use a Dispel Other Scroll or a Staff of Dispel. The scroll and staff can be found in random loot from as low as level 6 and the scroll is sometimes available from some stores that sell random leveled scrolls, such as the Mystic Emporium in the Imperial City Market District. Once J'skar reappears, he will complain that you're ""no fun at all"" but agrees to tell Jeanne that you found him."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:A_Brush_with_Death","Listen to rumors in Cheydinhal about the missing painter, and meet his wife, Tivela, in their house. Tivela tells you about her husband locking himself in his room; go to his room, and enter the painting. Find Rythe and he tells you about a thief who stole his magic paintbrush. Find the thief's corpse and retrieve the paintbrush. Return to Rythe with the brush and you will both return to Tamriel. He will reward you with the Apron of Adroitness.","RemasteredOblivion The mysterious painting The mysterious painting Missing Painter[edit] If you ask around town in Cheydinhal, people will tell you that Rythe Lythandas, a famous painter, has gone missing, and his wife, Tivela, is very upset. Go to the Lythandas house on the south side of town, and talk to Tivela for more information. Tivela tells you that Rythe had locked himself in his study, as he often did. However, after not seeing him for several days, Tivela decided to investigate. Upon doing so, she discovers that Rythe has disappeared. Find Rythe[edit] Tivela gives you the key to Rythe's study. Open the door and take a look around. You should notice fairly quickly that one of the paintings is actually a door. Enter the painting. You soon arrive in a painted semblance of the great forest, and Rythe is standing near you. He reveals that a thief stole his magical paintbrush, which allows him to enter paintings to make them look more realistic. The thief created some painted trolls to guard him, but instead they killed him. Rythe needs the paintbrush so that both of you can escape. If you ask him about the painted trolls, he gives you six bottles of turpentine, which do a level dependent amount of damage (see chart below) to painted trolls when applied to your weapon. Retrieve the Brush[edit] RemasteredOblivion One of the six painted trolls One of the six painted trolls There are six painted trolls that tend to be hard to kill. Two applications of turpentine generally kill one painted troll, but depending on your level you may need up to four (see the table below.) Fire damage works similarly on painted trolls as on standard trolls. The trolls also cannot jump or climb, so rocks can provide a safe haven for your character during battle. However, they are fast, and you will generally not outrun one for long. Each troll also has painted troll fat, a unique ingredient with different properties than regular troll fat. This quest is the only place in the game where you can get it, and it can not be duplicated in the Enchanted Chest. Therefore, you may want to kill as many painted trolls here as you can find. You can evade most of the trolls if, instead of following the path, you travel south and a bit west over the rocks from where you start. You will still have to kill the one or two trolls closest to the thief's corpse, but with six bottles of turpentine, this shouldn't be a problem. You can also lure them to Lythandas, who, although weak, is essential and will not die. Return to Tamriel[edit] RemasteredOblivion Rythe using the Brush to escape Rythe using the Brush to escape After looting the thief's corpse and returning the brush to Rythe, he paints a portal back to Tamriel. When you arrive, stick around and listen to the conversation he has with his wife. Afterwards, he'll give you the Apron of Adroitness, a light armor chest piece with a leveled agility and intelligence boost. If you do this quest early and want to wait for better gear, you should leave while Rythe and Tivela are still talking. Come back later to receive your now higher-level apron. This works because the apron level is determined the moment you receive it from Rythe. Turpentine Leveling[edit] There seem to be several ""sweet spots"" for the best level to do this quest.  Both the Trolls and the Turpentines are leveled, but the Turpentines only increase in damage every 4 levels, while the Trolls increase every level, so if you do the quest at either level 1 or a multiple of 4, you will do optimal damage with the Turpentine.  Level 1 is clearly the best time to do this quest as seen from the chart below.  Turpentines do not increase in damage after level 20 so it will only get harder after that.  This chart does not take into account the damage from the weapon you use to deliver the poison. Level Health Damage # Needed  Level Health Damage # Needed  Level Health Damage # Needed   1 25 20 1.25  8 200 100 2  15 375 150 2.5   2 50 20 2.5  9 225 100 2.25  16 400 200 2   3 75 20 3.75  10 250 100 2.5  17 425 200 2.13   4 100 50 2  11 275 100 2.75  18 450 200 2.25   5 125 50 2.4  12 300 150 2  19 475 200 2.38   6 150 50 3  13 325 150 2.17  20 500 250 2   7 175 50 3.5  14 350 150 2.33  21 525 250 2.1"

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Canvas_the_Castle","Speak with Countess Arriana Valga to learn of the investigation. Speak to the witnesses and suspects to gather clues. After the interviews, find any physical evidence. Confront the culprit, and extract a confession. Return to the Countess and either turn the culprit in or absolve them.","The Broad Brush[edit] If you talk to Countess Arriana Valga in Castle Chorrol she will claim to be in the middle of an investigation. If her disposition is 50 or better she will ask you to help, otherwise she will brush you off. Someone has stolen a sentimental painting of the Countess' husband, Charrus Valga, who was killed in battle. The painting hung in her throne room, and the only two people left as suspects are the court mage and the porter. She will also give you the names of three other people to speak to, who may help solve the case. She will also warn you that she will be very cross if you accuse the wrong person. Canvas the Witnesses[edit] None of the witnesses will talk to you about the investigation until you raise their disposition enough. The Countess was good enough to give the general locations of the five people you need to track down, as well as some keys and permission to enter the castle's restricted sections: Bittneld the Curse-Bringer, the Captain of the Guard, will either be patrolling Chorrol or in the castle barracks Chanel, the court mage, is under curfew in the private quarters of the castle Laythe Wavrick, the herald, can either be found in the great hall by the throne, or in the private quarters Orgnolf Hairy-Legs, the castle porter, is also under curfew in the private quarters Orok gro-Ghoth, the steward, can also be found in the private quarters or at Northern Goods and Trade The easiest person to find is Laythe, standing by the throne in the great hall, so you should get him out of the way. He will tell you that he stays near the throne and deals with visitors, but didn't see anything. He will mention that Orgnolf has a drinking problem, and has taken to borrowing money from others to feed his habit. Next you should talk to Orok. From 10am until midday he can be found alternating between the great hall and the private quarters, then he leaves for Northern Goods and Trade. He returns at 2pm and will wander around the private quarters until he goes to sleep. Orok will tell you that it was raining quite heavily that evening, so he didn't go for his usual walk. However, he did not see either Chanel or Orgnolf, mostly because he stayed in his quarters. Lastly he will mention that he caught Orgnolf drinking in the west tower once. Now you should track down Bittneld before moving on to the suspects. Bittneld can be a bit tricky to find if he is on patrol, but from midnight until 10am he is either in the castle barracks or standing in the main hall of the castle. Bittneld reveals that he too saw nothing, as he was out patrolling. However, he noticed Chanel spending a lot of time in the West Tower, which he questioned her about and received a somewhat satisfactory answer (she claimed she was researching her spells). The Fine Detail[edit] So far there has not been much witnessing by the witnesses, so it's time to interview the suspects. As two people have mentioned Orgnolf being a drunk, he should be easier to crack, so we'll start there. Orgnolf won't be hard to find as he's restricted to his quarters. Asking him about the night in question will have him claim that he was arguing with a delivery boy in the great hall who had had an accident in the rain, breaking a wine shipment. Afterward, Orgnolf retired to his room. Then find Chanel in her quarters. She will claim to have spent the evening taking star readings in the courtyard, went to the dining area for a while after that, and then went to bed. Do not accuse anyone yet, for without evidence you cannot back up your claim. Both stories have holes, but you need evidence. The first thing to do is retrace the suspects movements to see if you can spot anything. There is nothing to be found along Orgnolf's route, but along Chanel's route there are some suspicious paint stains on the carpet in the dining room off the great hall. Next thing is to investigate the west tower that seems to be heavily used by both suspects. If you follow Orok's testimony and search the upper rooms you can find Orgnolf's drinking den. However, if you go to the lower area and search around you should be able to find a painting. The evidence seems to be stacking up against Chanel, so you should pay another visit to her room. If you investigate the oddly placed lectern and chairs, you will uncover some painting tools. Unveiling the Thief[edit] Now it's time to make an accusation. Finding all the evidence does not remove the choice of accusing either suspect. However, be sure to only accuse the guilty party or your reward from the Countess will be reduced. The evidence against Orgnolf is lackluster at best. He is a drunk desperate for money, and his supposed argument with a delivery boy was not witnessed by Laythe. That said you can still accuse him, but he will not confess and be indignant about the accusation. The evidence against Chanel on the other hand is quite substantial. She claimed to be star reading on a night two others say was raining, the spilled paint and footprints in the dining room, and the painting tools in her lectern. There is also the more circumstantial painting in the west tower where she spends a lot of time. When you accuse her (with a disposition less than 70) she will almost confess, but will not speak fully until she trusts you more. After you raise her disposition she will make a full confession. She will claim she only took it due to her love of the Count, and jealousy of the time the Countess spent with the painting. She will also reveal the location of the painting. Restoration or a Clean Slate[edit] You now have two choices, take the painting and turn Chanel in, or leave the painting and absolve both suspects. You will receive different rewards depending on the choices you made. Turn in Chanel: If you did not accuse Orgnolf: a reward of eight gems and a level-dependent amount of gold. You will also receive one fame point and Chanel will disappear from the game. If you accused Orgnolf: a smaller amount of level-dependent gold, and no fame points or gems. Absolve both suspects: an even smaller amount of level-dependent gold. Chanel will give you a special Reward Painting (worth 500 gold if you sell it) after three weeks. Note that this reward painting is a new picture, not the portrait that was originally stolen. You do not receive any fame points.

Second, never kill anyone on the job. This is not the Dark Brotherhood. Animals and monsters can be slain if necessary. Third, don't steal from the poor. The peasants and beggars are under the personal protection of the Gray Fox, particularly here on the Waterfront. This doesn't quite reflect real life in the guild. First, if you are wearing the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal you can never be expelled from the guild. If you are the Gray Fox but not wearing the cowl you may still be expelled. Second, to be expelled for stealing you have to be caught. If you are not detected while stealing you will not be expelled. Third, remaining undetected while attacking is not enough. Even attacking with 100% or greater Chameleon is not enough to stop you being expelled. Fourth, you are not actually expelled for killing anybody on the job. Most quests have a blood price that prevents completion until paid but you remain a member of the guild. Fifth, it's tricky to be expelled for killing a fellow thief as taking more than one hit will cause an expulsion for attacking before the murder criterion applies. Any of these criteria apply not just to Thieves Guild members but to members of the Imperial City Waterfront Resident faction. Regardless of your offense, you will be given a quest update that tells you to talk to Armand, although S'Krivva can help out as well. Simply pay either Doyen the appropriate fee and you will be reinstated. This quest, however, remains active in your journal. The costs to regain membership in the guild are as follows: 200 gold for theft, 500 gold for assault, 1000 gold for murder, 1000 gold for any unnecessary murders during a quest."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Cheydinhal_Recommendation","Speak with Falcar, the head of the Cheydinhal Mages Guild, who asks you to find his lost ring. Go see Deetsan to obtain a key to the outside well and a Buoyancy spell. Retrieve the ring from the well and speak with Deetsan again. Search Falcar's room for your recommendation, but find evidence of Necromancy instead. Speak once again with Deetsan and she will agree to write your recommendation for you.","Cheydinhal Mages Guild[edit] Speak to Falcar in the Cheydinhal Mages Guild for a recommendation. He wants you to find a Ring of Burden an Associate recently lost. He suspects it was thrown down the guild well and says you'll need a key to get in; Deetsan—another guild member—has one. Deetsan will agree to talk to you about your assignment only if Falcar is not in the same room, which is the case between 1pm and 6pm. Once he's out of sight, you'll learn you're not the first one to get this task. Vidkun - the previous Associate - disappeared while trying to find the ring. After this word of caution, Deetsan will give you the Well Key and a Buoyancy spell. You're Gonna Need a Bigger Feather[edit] RemasteredOblivion A grisly sight awaits you down the well A grisly sight awaits you down the well The well is just behind the guild. Create a save point before entering the well, as this part of the quest is prone to a bug. Use the Buoyancy spell Deetsan gave you or a similar Water Breathing spell or enchantment as the well has no air pockets to breathe in. There is obviously no need to worry about this if you are an Argonian. The well itself is small and you'll find poor Vidkun's body inside with the ring. The ring has a weight of 150, so be sure you have at least that much space in your inventory or a Feather or Fortify Strength spell or potion. Otherwise, you may end up like Vidkun. You do not actually need to bring the ring back to the guild; you can drop it immediately after receiving the related quest update. There is also a Nirnroot in the well that you may want to grab. On the way back out, make sure the camera is in first person mode, otherwise lining up the exit can be extremely difficult. Alternatively, if you just grab the ring, it will not add to your encumbrance. Drag it to the well exit, then pick it up and exit, dropping it outside. Falcar's Tantrum[edit] When you return, Falcar is nowhere to be seen. Speak with Deetsan instead and tell her that Vidkun is dead. She will have a different reaction if you tell her about Vidkun after you ask about your recommendation. If you present the ring to her, she will tell you that it's useless and to drop it anywhere, as it is most likely just part of a ""sick joke"" of Falcar's. Falcar, it seems, got quite mad when Deetsan told him that she had helped you and when she threatened to report him to the Council of Mages, he yelled some nonsense and stormed out of the guild. Deetsan says to search Falcar's room to see if he had already written your letter of recommendation. Falcar's Secret[edit] Head down to the basement and search Falcar's room. Open the locked drawer (its difficulty is leveled) and find two Black Soul Gems, a sign that Necromancy is afoot. There is nothing else to find, so return to Deetsan with the gems. Deetsan will take the two gems and offer to write your recommendation for you herself. If you have already raided Falcar's room before he left, you cannot give Deetsan the Black Soul Gems before this point. You only need one Black Soul Gem to finish the quest, but both will disappear once you talk to Deetsan. The spare soul gem can be used normally. However, these are not counted as proper Black Soul Gems by the game, but as regular Grand Soul Gems instead. Therefore, these cannot be used to trap NPC souls. Be careful not to use both, as then you will not be able to complete the quest (see bugs). Deetsan will accept these gems if they are filled, but she will not notice any other Black Soul Gems you might have in your inventory."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Clavicus_Vile","Present Clavicus Vile with 500 gold once you reach level 20. Clavicus will tell you that he wants the sword containing the soul of the warrior Umbra. Retrieve the Umbra sword from the Bosmer, Umbra, located in the Ayleid ruin Vindasel.Note: Umbra may be killed, and the sword retrieved, at any level, and even before initiating the quest. Once Umbra is dead and the sword is in your possession, speak with Ma'Raska to initiate the quest, then approach the shrine of Clavicus Vile. Return to the shrine for your reward, the Masque of Clavicus Vile. Alternatively, you can refuse to give Umbra to Clavicus Vile, and you get to keep the sword as your reward.","Locating the Shrine of Clavicus Vile[edit] The shrine is located in the West Weald, a bit off the east of the Gold Road as it travels south, near Lake Rumare, and between Fort Virtue and the Ayleid ruin, Ceyatatar. You must find the shrine on your own; no one will tell you where it is. An Offering to the God[edit] Once at the shrine, talk to Ma'Raska, a Khajiit. He will tell you that you need to make an offering of 500 gold to speak with the daedra. Once you offer the 500 gold, Clavicus Vile will say: A mortal! Wonderful. Always a pleasure. Perhaps you'll do a service for me, mortal. And I'll reward you. A fair bargain, don't you think? You will retrieve for me a sword, a very special sword. It contains the soul of Umbra, a hero I have had dealings with in the past. Bring the sword to me, and I'll reward you with my Masque. You'll not find a better bargain, mortal. Begin your search in Pell's Gate. To make things interesting, a talking statue of a dog, Barbas, decides to follow you. He spends most of his time trying to convince you that returning the sword to Clavicus Vile is a mistake. (After he travels to your inventory, the dog statue will disappear from the Shrine; it will reappear at the end of the quest.) His introductory speech goes like this: Hello? Hey! Pay attention! In your pack. The dog. I swear, you heroes aren't particularly quick on the uptake.... Good. Got your attention. I'm Barbas, the Hound of Clavicus Vile. Not that I've always been a hound, or always been called Barbas. I've also been a Redguard. For a while I was a scamp, making deals with Orcs. But, for now, I am His Hound, and I serve the Lord Clavicus. A word of advice here. You've made a bad deal. This Umbra -- bad business. Things always end badly where that one's concerned. Clavicus has always been a little blind to that. And it'll end badly this time, too. So, just leave things be. Walk away. It's your best bet, really. Task at Hand[edit] Clavicus Vile initially directs you to ask about Umbra in Pell's Gate, which is a short distance east of the shrine south of the Red Ring Road. The most knowledgeable villager in Pell's Gate is Irroke the Wide, to whom Umbra, formerly called Lenwin, had been apprenticed. You learn that Lenwin had found the sword Umbra, and went on a murdering rampage because Umbra (probably the sword) hungered for souls. Irroke directs you to the nearby Ayleid ruin, Vindasel, to start your search. Vindasel is easy to find if you follow the Red Ring Road west from the village. When you encounter Umbra, if you are on the quest, she will give you a choice of staying and fighting or leaving in peace: Leaving - If you choose to leave be sure to continue through Umbra's dialogues until you get to tell her ""I'll leave in peace"". Then, either return to Vile's shrine or turn around and sneak attack Umbra and take the sword. Barbas thinks leaving is a good idea, and when Umbra offers to let you leave, he will say: This is your out, friend. Leave it alone. How about we just march on back to the shrine and tell Clavicus the deal is off? Sure, he'll be a bit put off, but you won't be dead. At least, you probably won't. That's better odds than you're getting here. If you choose to leave in peace, Barbas will say: Good move, kid. Some things are better left alone. Let's get back to the Shrine. I'll smooth things over with the big guy. I'm sure he'll understand. Fighting. Umbra is a very tough adversary and you had better be prepared for a hard fight. If you survive the fight, you get to take possession of not only the sword, but a full suit of (leveled) ebony armor. After you have the sword, Barbas will plead again for you to forget the whole thing: I'm telling you: don't bring that sword back to Clavicus. It'll ruin him, I'm sure. I mean, not completely: He's still a Daedra Prince and all that. Look, keep the sword if you want. That's your decision. But don't give it back to Clavicus. He doesn't know what's good for him sometimes. Returning to the Shrine[edit] If you want to keep Umbra as a zero-weight quest item, simply never return to Clavicus Vile's shrine. If you wish to officially end this quest, however, you must return to the shrine. When you talk to Vile there are three options in all: You don't have the sword. If you chose not to fight Umbra, and return to the shrine without the sword, the quest is complete. You don't get any reward, but you also aren't penalized. Clavicus will say: You would break our bargain? You dare to trifle with me? Take care, mortal. Clavicus Vile watches you now. And waits. If you have the sword in your inventory, Clavicus will first say: You've brought the sword! Now give it to me, as we agreed. Umbra and I have unfinished business. Turn over the sword. In exchange you receive the Masque of Clavicus Vile, a helmet with +20 Personality. In this case, Clavicus says: Excellent! A pitiful sword with a pitiful soul in exchange for a Masque fit for a god. You've gotten the better of this bargain, mortal. Now, I have business to attend to. Run along. Perhaps I'll be looking for you again.... Keep the sword. The disadvantages to this approach are: Clavicus Vile's followers do not like you. You do not have a Daedric artifact to use for the Blood of the Daedra quest (although any of the other 14 artifacts can be used instead). Umbra ceases to be a quest item, in particular it is now 45 pounds in weight instead of 0. Clavicus will become outraged with you, but although he threatens you, there are no visible repercussions in-game. You would dare?!?! We had a bargain, little hero. You would risk my wrath for a pitiful little sword? I will be watching you mortal. And waiting. Whichever route you choose, this quest is officially complete, and you are rid of Barbas. Keeping Umbra does not prevent you from doing Hermaeus Mora's quest. If you never killed Umbra, it is now possible to return to Vindasel, kill her, and get the sword. The advantage is that the sword is now a permanent quest item, with zero weight. The disadvantages are that you can't do this until after level 20 and that you can never drop the sword. Barbas will now finally leave your inventory, but not without a few last words. Oh, well. Been good knowing you, kid. Back to being His Hound for me. As for you... good luck, I guess. I've met worse."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Coldest_Sleep","Receive the next contract from the hollowed-out tree stump behind Stonewall Shields. Make your way up the mountain to Hoar-Blood. Decide how you will kill him and his wolf companion. Make your way to the next dead drop.","The Target[edit] Your next dead drop location is a hollowed-out tree stump in the Market District of the Imperial City, behind Stonewall Shields. Your orders instruct you to travel to Gnoll Mountain to kill Havilstein Hoar-Blood. According to the dead drop orders, he murdered a mead hall chieftain back on Solstheim and the victim's sister wants bloody revenge. This is out of the ordinary, as Nord tradition dictates some form of material compensation. Up the Mountain[edit] Travel to Bruma, you then need to head directly east to Gnoll Mountain. The easiest way up the mountain is the trail. Follow the trail that starts at the Bruma East Gate. Take the left path when you get to the ""Bruma-Imperial City"" crossroads. Take the first right when you get to Dragonclaw Rock. You'll run into a Bandit camp very shortly, so be ready. Continue east past the camp. Now, head up the mountain and across the bridge. Hoar-Blood and Redmaw (his wolf companion) can be found at the end of the trail. If you have the Wizard's Tower official download, you can fast travel to Frostcrag Spire and follow the road away from it. From here, it is not a far walk to Gnoll Mountain. Killing Hoar-Blood[edit] Similar to your other targets, Havilstein is well equipped, with an almost full set of leveled light armor, and a leveled battleaxe, which is usually enchanted. He never eats, so no use of poisoned apples this time. He does sleep though, so you can approach him at night for an easy kill. If you're still having trouble with executing him, remember the terrain you're fighting in; the steep Jerall Mountains allow for painful fall damage. Otherwise, try getting him in a place where he will be unable to easily reach you. The Next Dead Drop[edit] Now that business has been taken care of, you should head for Nornal to collect your reward/next contract. The ruins are filled with rats, crabs, and marauders, but this doesn't change if you're higher than level 5. Upon entering, head down the stairs and take a right. Dive under the water and swim towards the door. It's locked. There exists A Rusty Key, that opens the lock, if your security skill isn't that high. However, an alternative way of entering the room is to use a potion or item that gives you ""Water Walking on Self"" and walk through the iron bars above the door, effectively bypassing the gate. In the chest is your gold and your next contract. You could also just jump out of the water to get over the gate."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Collector","Find an Ayleid Statue and sell it. Find and talk to Umbacano. Recover the nine remaining statues. Return them to Umbacano.","Ayleid Artifacts[edit] One Ayleid Statue, with the other nine visible in the display case in the background To begin this quest, find an Ayleid Statue. There are ten in total, one in each of the Ayleid ruins listed in the section below. Selling this statue to a merchant will net you a maximum of 250 septims. The statue disappears from the merchant's inventory as soon as you exit the barter screen. After selling the statue, expect to be approached by a messenger after a short period of time. The messenger will take you to Umbacano's Manor in the Talos Plaza District, where you find out that he has purchased the statue from the merchant. Alternatively, take the first statue directly to Umbacano. Enter his manor and show the statue to his butler, Jollring, who will then introduce you to Umbacano. Umbacano will then buy the statue for 500 gold, which is double its base value. The Collector[edit] You learn from Umbacano that the statue is one of the Ten Ancestors, statues that once resided in the Temple of the Ancestors, now known as White Gold Tower. Before the fall of the Temple to the rebellious Cyrodiil, the statues were removed for safekeeping and held within ten different Ayleid cities. He wishes to acquire the full set of ten, but he lacks a resourceful treasure hunter. To continue this quest, search Ayleid ruins until another statue is found; see the section below for locations. When the second statue is sold to Umbacano, he will say that his research has discovered five Ayleid settlements where he believes statues were taken—Fanacas, Mackamentain, Moranda, Ninendava, and Wenyandawik. Map markers for all of these will appear on the map, but you will have to travel there manually, unless you have been there before. Next Assignment[edit] Once the third statue is sold to him, he will give you another assignment as well: the quest Nothing You Can Possess. He will pay 5,500 gold when the tenth statue is delivered (500 for the statue, plus a 5000 bonus for completing the set). WARNING: It is recommended to find and sell all ten statues to Umbacano before Stage 60 of Secrets of the Ayleids, which follows Nothing You Can Possess. After this point, The Collector cannot be completed successfully."

Make your way through the cave until you reach Mannimarco. Talk with him for a while, then kill him. Return to the University triumphant. The Arch-Mage's quarters are yours!","Traven's Sacrifice[edit] When you are ready, speak with Traven about tasks, he will say: ""Are you truly prepared for this task? I cannot be certain what awaits you, but I am sure we will not speak again after you begin."" If you change your mind about starting yet, he will urge you to hurry: ""There is little time. Please prepare yourself as quickly as possible. The entire guild depends on you."" This task starts off unlike any other mission that Traven has given you. He explains that Mannimarco intended the Colossal Black Soul Gem for Traven's own soul and that you will grant his wish; by carrying the filled soul gem, you will be immune to Mannimarco's attempts to turn you into a Worm Thrall: ""Then hear me, and hear me well. Mannimarco will have what he seeks, but it will be his undoing at your hands. With this gem in your possession, you will be impervious to his attempt to enthrall you. When he fails, that is when you shall strike. When we are done speaking, you will take this gem, you will then seek out Mannimarco, and destroy him. Get to him anyway you can. It is your only hope for defeating him. I have full confidence in you, and so I leave the guild in your care. When I am gone, you will be recognized as Arch-Mage and leader of the Guild. Lead your fellow mages, and lead them well. The future rests on your shoulders. Farewell, my friend."" After promoting you to Arch-Mage he will mark Mannimarco's location at Echo Cave on your map then commit suicide by casting a soul trap and fire damage spell upon himself and soul trapping his soul into the Colossal Black Soul Gem. You may then loot his corpse for anything you want, including the Filled Black Soul Gem. You must then proceed to deal with Mannimarco. See bugs for potential problems with this sequence. The King of Worms[edit] Take the soul gem from Traven's corpse and head to Echo Cave far north of the Imperial City, just west of Bruma. At the entrance to the cave you'll be greeted by a necromancer, a Dunmer named Bolor Savel, who says that he has the key to the cave and that he will relinquish it only in death. Prove him right and take the key from his body. Make your way through the caverns, encountering quite a few necromancers. The cave is fairly linear - just follow the compass. Mannimarco, the King of Worms, can be found in the large room in the Necromancer's Chamber. A finger-bone style railing will pop up and surround the island. Mannimarco then ""paralyzes"" you and approaches to talk. He explains his fascination with the souls of powerful individuals and expresses disappointment that Traven did not come personally. Eventually he'll try to claim your soul and turn you into a Worm Thrall: ""I see Bolor was unsuccessful in delaying you. Very well. I shall reanimate him once we are done here. Perhaps we shall chat for a while, since you really have no other options? I must say, I expected Arch-Mage Traven, rather than his star pupil. I am disappointed to see that he could not face me himself. I have met so many of his predecessors over the years. I developed a particular fondness for Galerion, ill-preserved though he may be. But here you are instead. Skilled enough to make it this far, which speaks volumes about you. Perhaps you'll be as useful to me as Traven would."" I'll never help you! ""Oh, my dear, I didn't mean to imply that you have a choice. I will make you another in a long tradition of Worm Thralls, and take my time in studying you. Your very soul will be forfeit to me."" I'll serve you if you spare me. ""I'm afraid you misunderstand.  I already have more servants than I need.  Your body will be preserved as a Worm Thrall.  Your soul is mine; I intend to study both to learn more about the source of your power."" Either leads to: What?! ""Power, my dear friend. I seek power, and so I acquire and study those who have some degree of it. We are after the same things, your guild and I. Yet you worry about 'good' and 'evil' and do not accept they are manifestations of the same thing. So you brand me a villain, and make vain attempts to destroy me. I watch, and I wait, and I collect you when you come for me. Instead of drawing Traven out, I have received you instead. Perhaps I shall personally go and collect him when we are done here."" He will then turn hostile and proceed to attack you. Despite Mannimarco being a powerful Necromancer, he will often forget about his magic and simply attack you with his dagger. He has a fairly typical array of necromancer spells, and he can conjure powerful undead minions to aid him. You might want to summon something of your own to serve as a distraction. Kill him any way you like - this may take a while as he's essentially immune to most normal attacks or the attacks of summoned creatures. As an Altmer he is vulnerable to magical attacks so - fittingly - the most appropriate way to finish him may be a magical duel. If you have trouble with this fight, jump into the water and he will not be able to attack you. This will give you time to recover and think of a new strategy. You will need to explore underwater to find a secret tunnel to get out of the water though, so a water breathing spell or clothing item is recommended. This is no longer possible in the remastered version of the game, as there is no way to get to the water. Return Victorious[edit] Once you have slain Mannimarco, should you return to the university, Raminus Polus will greet you upon your triumphant return: ""Arch-Mage! You have returned! Mannimarco has been defeated? I can hardly believe it! The King of Worms is no more! I... I received a note from Arch-Mage Traven. I know what he did for us, and that he selected you to take his place. I will mourn for him during my own, private time. For now, I cannot help but rejoice. You have brought safety to the guild, and I thank you. I have already sent word to all the local guild halls that you are now in charge. Congratulations, Arch-Mage."" You are now the head of the guild and may take advantage of some perks, including access to the top room in the tower, which can now be used as a house."

You can buy the ""Summon Faded Wraith"" spell from Gaspar Stegine at the Arcane University or Athragar at the Chorrol Mages Guild. Alternatively, it is possible to find a Summon Wraith scroll in random loot starting at level 16. Although the scroll is titled Summon Wraith, the scroll will in fact summon a Faded Wraith.

Nedaren points you to Garrus Darelliun, who will direct you to Aldos Othran when asked about Ulrich. Speak with Othran, and he'll have an altercation with a guard in which he is killed. Leave, and speak with Llevana who tells you to bring Ulrich to her. Before you bring Ulrich to Llevana, speak with Garrus for an alternate method. Decide which method to take. When Ulrich is dealt with, you receive your gold and single fame/infamy point.","Corruption[edit] Aldos Othran's house The corruption started when the new captain of the guard, Ulrich Leland, arrived in Cheydinhal. Ask about ""Rumors"" in Cheydinhal and you'll learn the topic ""Fines."" Ask about the exorbitant fines and you'll be directed to the outspoken Llevana Nedaren to help fight the corruption. She tells you to seek out Garrus Darelliun in the Count's Castle. When you talk to him, ask him about Ulrich. You'll need a disposition of at least 60 with him before he'll tell you anything. Garrus tells you that he needs a witness to be able to bring the case before the Count. He directs you to Aldos Othran, a local drunk that lost his house after being unable to pay the various fines imposed on him by Ulrich. Deal with Ulrich[edit] Save your game, as there is a possible bug that can happen here. After you mention Ulrich to Aldos, he tells you to follow him. He walks up to his house and starts berating a guard. After a short discussion he pulls a knife and the guard kills him. Your quest journal now indicates that you need to talk to Llevana again. After you talk to Llevana she snaps and tells you to bring Ulrich to her. She tells you to inform him that she has ""information that incriminates him"" and she'll ""take care of him"" when he arrives. Before you talk to Ulrich, visit Garrus again. He proposes an alternate plan; you are to sneak into Ulrich's quarters (located in the Cheydinhal Castle Guard Barracks), and look for evidence to use against him. Garrus gives you a key and your journal indicates that you need to choose between the two methods. Both methods will yield one Fame point. Garrus' Method[edit] If you pick Garrus' method, you find a note in Ulrich's room (on top of a book on top of the dresser to the right as you enter) that shows he's been sending huge sums to his family and basically milking the town. Give this note to Garrus, and he runs off to the Count and tells you to meet him in the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn in two hours (possible bug triggering can happen now, see Bugs section below). When you meet Garrus at the inn he thanks you for your help and gives you a level dependent (see below) amount of gold. Ulrich is incarcerated in the town dungeons indefinitely. Garrus is then promoted to Captain of the Guard. Llevana's Method[edit] If you pick Llevana's method, lead Ulrich to her house. Inside, they talk for a bit, then she paralyzes him and summons two Tunnel Rats to eat him. Once he's dead your journal is updated. Talk to Garrus, who admonishes you for choosing bloodshed but gives you a level dependent amount of gold since you acted for the good of Cheydinhal (less gold than if you choose the non-violent method). You can loot Ulrich's body for free though. Llevana goes to jail, and Garrus gets promoted to Captain of the Guard. Your Own Method[edit] There is a third option that neither Llevana nor Garrus would have dared to suggest: seek justice by your own hand. At this stage, slaying Ulrich yourself will complete the quest. Speaking to Garrus afterwards will result in him berating you for such a murderous choice and you will get no gold. Depending upon how Ulrich dies, you risk a bounty or jail time for your action. This result will occur if Ulrich dies by any means other than Llevana's trap. Methods such as poisoned apples, Frenzy-induced attacks, or dying during the Defense of Bruma will earn you no criminal bounty. Nevertheless, Garrus will still say you murdered Ulrich in cold blood. It can also be noted that Ulrich can also be killed in the very early stages of the quest, prior to Aldos' confrontation with the guard. Doing so will result the same reaction from Garrus, as well as a forfeiture of any gold reward, but can prevent Aldos from getting killed.

The location, marked on your map, is in the northeastern part of the province at Lake Arrius Caverns, just north of Cheydinhal. Unlike Weynon Priory and Kvatch, you cannot immediately fast travel to Lake Arrius unless you happen to have been there before. Gaining Entry[edit] RemasteredOblivion Strict rules apply to your attire Strict rules apply to your attire The Doorkeeper just inside the cavern will let you into the shrine without too much hassle. He says you should go and speak with Harrow, Warden of the Shrine of Dagon. Harrow will ask you to hand over all of your possessions (including all of your gold) and put on an Initiate's robe. If you refuse, you'll get a warning and another chance to don the robe. If you follow Harrow's instructions, you temporarily become a member of the Mythic Dawn and you are allowed to follow Harrow into the shrine. At any point, you can refuse to cooperate and instead fight your way in. You will be told that your cover has been blown. You will then need to fight your way through the entire shrine, killing all the cultists you meet. You can choose whatever option is better suited to your strengths. If you are stealthy - or just really good at running - playing along with the Cult may be advantageous. Strong fighters may have an easier time simply marching in fully armed and cutting down everything in their path. There are a few strategies for coping with Harrow taking all your equipment: Harrow will not take any quest items that you may have in your inventory. Therefore having weapons such as the Blade of Woe, Umbra, the Honorblade of Chorrol, or even the weapons shipment from the Desolate Mine can be advantageous. You can drop most of your equipment on the ground just before speaking to Harrow (you may not want to drop small, difficult-to-find items like keys). You can then pick everything up the moment after you agree to hand everything over. This allows you to enter the next section fully equipped without blowing your cover. You will still need to loot Harrow later in order to retrieve your gold and any other items you allowed him to take. You can subsequently pickpocket Harrow to retrieve some items. Zero-weight permanent bound items are perfect candidates, since detection is influenced by item weight. You can obtain some replacement equipment from the storage room at the far end of the Shrine Antechamber. You should drop a few lockpicks before speaking to Harrow (and pick them up after you give him your equipment) because this room is locked. Even if you do not give your equipment to Harrow, a visit here is recommended because it has some nice loot. You can also walk up to Harrow and let him see you. Then when he starts walking toward you, start walking backwards and back out the door. He will stop at the entrance to the door and start walking back to his position. While he is walking back you can go around him and go through the door without having to give up your stuff. If you have a high Conjuration level, one strategy that involves killing the doorkeeper would be to conjure up a spell casting creature (preferably a powerful one such as a gloom wraith or Lich) and, after having spoken to the doorkeeper, start attacking your conjured creature. Once it has become aggressive and attempts to attack you with ranged spells, immediately run and stand behind the doorkeeper and wait for a spell to hit him. Once he's been hit, he will immediately turn on your creature and begin attacking it, which will then make the creature target him instead of you. As he is not a particularly powerful NPC, the doorkeeper will likely perish relatively quickly; if he doesn't die on the first attempt, repeat this strategy until he does. Once he's died, simply move all of your possessions onto his body. Once you've talked to Harrow, go back and retrieve your items from his corpse, then proceed with Harrow to the shrine. This strategy should make the battle at the shrine much easier. The Ritual[edit] RemasteredOblivion ""Hear now the words of Lord Dagon."" ""Hear now the words of Lord Dagon."" There are two main options here, largely dictated by whether or not you turned over your equipment when you entered the shrine. If You Handed Over Your Equipment[edit] Harrow will lead you to a ceremony, which is already in progress, directed by Mankar Camoran himself. After a short speech, Mankar will disappear into a magical portal to Paradise, his realm; unfortunately he will also take the Amulet of Kings with him. It is impossible to kill Mankar at this point, because he is flagged as essential. If attacked, he will become a ""ghost"", meaning that you cannot interact with him in any way (including attempting to pickpocket the Amulet of Kings, which is impossible anyway because he is wearing it). Trying to obstruct the quest at this stage can lead to a serious bug later, so your only option is to allow Mankar to escape. Once Mankar gets away, a quest message will pop up to inform you that your new target should be the Mysterium Xarxes, because it may aid you and Martin in retrieving the Amulet. At this point you will be introduced as a new Initiate to Ruma Camoran, Mankar's daughter and she will ask you to perform a ritual sacrifice of Jeelius, an Argonian priest. You may choose to agree or refuse to perform it. If you refuse, the cultists will immediately turn on you. Since you are weaponless and vastly outnumbered, this will be a very difficult battle. You have several choices at this point: Once you have the knife for the ceremony, you can wander around unbothered until you find Harrow among the worshippers. Simply use the dagger to kill him, then search the body for your items. Kill Jeelius, which will allow you to wait until things cool off a bit before stealing the book. Although you are now part of the Mythic Dawn, you cannot get out of the cave until you take the Mysterium Xarxes. Wait for one hour, which will allow the whole room to clear out except for Harrow, Ruma Camoran, and one additional guard (who stands behind the altar area). Then proceed to grab the book, attack those three and escape, fighting any other cultists along the way. Agree to the sacrifice (for now at least). Go to the podium and pick up the silver dagger. Then grab the Mysterium Xarxes and run for it. You'll need to keep running all the way through the Shrine Living Quarters (avoiding many cultists along the way). You won't be safe until you make it out of the caverns. If you are powerful enough to deal with the cultists, you can refuse to make the sacrifice, or even free Jeelius. If you want to save Jeelius, note that picking up the Mysterium Xarxes will cause the statue of Dagon to collapse on top of him. See Jeelius for tips on how to help him survive. See Fighting the Cultists for tips on how to survive the ensuing fight. If your Sneak skill is high enough, you can pickpocket your best items from Harrow and then use those items to kill him and take the rest of your stuff back, making the rest of the battle easier. Another way is to pickpocket some lockpicks from Harrow and use them to open the door at the end of the hall outside the Shrine. You will find a basement with some scrolls, potions, and weapons which will make it a lot easier when you attack. If You Blew Your Cover[edit] If you refused to turn over your equipment in the first place, you will need to kill Harrow (and the doorkeeper if he runs in). Fight and sneak your way through the antechamber and into the main Dagon Shrine, where the ceremony led by Mankar Camoran is going on. Your quest should update with your new target: the Mysterium Xarxes. Fight your way to it. Taking it will collapse the statue, close the entrance and open a new exit through the cult's living quarters. Using this method allows you to take followers into the shrine with you. Fighting the Cultists[edit] In most cases, you will end up having to fight your way through many Mythic Dawn cultists. By choosing opportune times to start fighting, you can reduce the number of cultists you will need to fight. In particular, most of the cultists will leave the shrine area if you wait for a while (the shadows on the upper level of the shrine area are good areas to hide while waiting). If you are outnumbered by cultists at the shrine, you can stand under the statue of Mehrunes Dagon. When the cultists are under it with you, run and grab the Mysterium Xarxes. This will cause the statue to collapse on top of them, killing most of them instantly. To avoid being cornered by multiple cultists, keep moving at all times. Use area effect staves/spells to damage as many people at once as possible. If your Conjuration is at least at an apprentice level, you can summon some bound armor and a bound weapon for extra protection against the cultists, as well as a summoned daedra or undead creature to help fight them. If you're playing as a stealthy archer, you can sneak to the far upper-right corner and play sniper from a perch. It will take a significant amount of time for the cultists to run all the way around and up to reach you. You could potentially pick many of them off with poisoned arrows by the time they realize what's going on and begin to move in. If you sneak up undetected on a cultist and cast a Frenzy spell, they will begin attacking each other. This can make it significantly easier on you because, as you never attacked directly, your cover will not be blown and one or more cultists will end up dead in the fight. Kill Harrow first and loot his corpse for your equipment, which will make it easier to kill the other cultists. Jeelius[edit] Helping Jeelius to survive this quest can be challenging (although is strictly optional). One challenge is avoiding his death when the statue of Mehrunes Dagon collapses on top of him. If you free him before taking the Mysterium Xarxes then the statue will not collapse on top of him; however, you cannot access the living quarters until you have the book, so this option makes it impossible to purge that area before he gets there. Otherwise, as soon as you grab the book, you can rush to stand over Jeelius, deflecting some of the statue, and casting protection and healing spells on him when necessary. Similarly, casting a short duration custom spell on him combining Shield, Fortify Endurance, and Fortify Health can make him tough enough to survive the statue falling. Also, casting a Destruction spell with an area effect on the falling statue may deflect most large chunks. Alternatively, cast Chameleon on self and Invisibility on the Argonian. Free him and he will run away, hiding in some corner. Now grab the book and the statue will collapse on the empty altar. Another method to easily keep Jeelius alive is by waiting in one hour increments repeatedly while the statue is crumbling on top of him. His health will refill each time you wait. As soon as you free Jeelius, he will run toward the exit, avoiding as many guards as he can. However, he will always take the long path through the living quarters, even if the (much shorter) route via the Antechamber is still accessible. Jeelius is able to cast a few randomly determined spells, so he might be able to heal himself and should be able to attack the cultists with a Destruction spell. However, he will die if he gets cornered. Trying to follow Jeelius can make things worse because it just attracts more cultists than if he tries to flee alone. If you do try to follow Jeelius, be prepared to use many healing (or even defensive) spells on him. To guarantee Jeelius's survival, you can delay freeing him until after you have gone through all of the living quarters and killed all of the cultists. Then return to the shrine, release him, and accompany him out through the empty corridors. This may take several attempts due to the statue falling. If you escort Jeelius through the caves, he will thank you once you get outside and introduce himself as Jeelius from the Temple of the One in the Imperial City. If he survives, you can go to the Temple of the One a few days later and he will give you free one-point skill boosts in Alchemy, Mysticism, and Restoration, provided they are below 90. Escaping from the Caverns[edit] No matter which option you choose, you will end up leaving the Dagon Shrine area through the door on the north side of the shrine, leading to the shrine living quarters. This door does not unlock until you take the Mysterium Xarxes, at which point the door you entered through also locks. There are many cultists (as many as 15) in the living quarters, all of whom have to be killed or avoided to make it out. Taking the time to check the chests and other containers can be worthwhile, because they may contain good loot but if taken, they are considered 'stolen' even though there is no 'red-handed' indication. Once you make it through to the first zone, Lake Arrius Caverns, your way is blocked by a ""rock wall"". The turn handle to activate the rock wall is at the start of the tunnel, in the same room. Return to the Temple[edit] When you finally make it outside, head toward Cloud Ruler Temple with the Mysterium Xarxes. Martin may be found in the Great Hall of the Temple, and he will take the Mysterium Xarxes. He believes it may hold the key to opening a portal to find Camoran, but he will need some time to safely study it."

Your target is Celedaen, a necromancer in Leafrot Cave who is trying to gain favor with the great Sovereign by attaining lichdom.

According to the journal, the fabled way of killing liches by shattering their Soul Container at any time is actually a myth. The only way to truly kill a lich is to, during the transformation, remove his Soul Container from his physical person while it is being used to transport his soul from his mortal body. Luckily, his transformation is not yet complete, leaving that weakness open for exploitation. This gives you two options: simply fight this powerful mage, or sneak up on him and pickpocket his Soul Container: the Sands of Resolve (looks like an hourglass).

A Simple Weapon Drop[edit] Burz gro-Khash asks you to deliver a weapons shipment to some Fighters Guild members in the Desolate Mine to the northwest. He gives you a bow, a longsword and a warhammer, all three made of steel and completely weightless. The location will be marked on your map. When you get close to the mine, you may be attacked by goblins - a sign of things to come. Inside the mine speak to Rienna, who will reveal that the mine has become infested with goblins. She takes a bow for herself and instructs you to give the other weapons to the two fighters (Elidor and Brag gro-Bharg) standing by the fire.

The Foul Beasts[edit] Once you have distributed the weapons, get ready to immediately fight the goblins. Follow the three fighters into the mine and dispose of any goblins you encounter. You will also notice several dead miners. All three fighters subscribe to the school of ""rush head first into battle without a strategic plan"", which may well end up getting some or all of them killed. Keep up and help them as best you can. In particular, it is recommended you quickly deal with the log trap in the back of the mine; see the Notes section for more details. As your companions tend to split up after the first room, it will be impossible to follow all of them. It is recommended to remain with Rienna, as she is armed with only a bow and more likely to be swarmed than the two other fighters. Elidor is also not well-suited to combat and may require additional supervision; Brag on the other hand is a hardy Orc and has the most damaging weapon of the three, thus requiring less attention. Targeted Fortify  and Restore Health spells can be useful in boosting your companions. Once all of the goblins are dead, return to Burz gro-Khash for your reward and possible promotion. Your reward is dependent upon how many of the other three fighters survived: If they all survived, you will get double the usual quest reward (200 to 1200 gold) and one Fame point. In addition to this, people will begin talking about how the Fighters Guild did a good job in the Desolate Mine. If one or more persons died, you will get only 80% of the standard quest reward (80 to 480 gold). You will not receive any Fame points. You will also have to endure various negative rumors about what happened at the mine. You may also be in line for a promotion from Burz. If this is the first Fighters Guild quest that you have completed, you will be promoted to the rank of Apprentice. You will then need to see Azzan in Anvil for your next quest, A Rat Problem. If you have already completed both of Azzan's quests, then you will be promoted to the rank of Journeyman.

Most general merchants have an infinite supply of bear pelts and are therefore easy sources; as soon as you buy the five bear pelts in their inventory, five more will appear. Alternatively, so long as you enter it without the Fighter's Guild quest Information Gathering being active, Glademist Cave is a good location to obtain multiple bear pelts quickly, as numerous bears can spawn inside. Additionally, the cupboard in the northeasternmost cavern may contain up to 5 bear pelts. Regardless, once you have given the pelts to Bralsa, she will agree to teach you more about Destruction."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Drunk_and_Disorderly","Receive the quest details from Modryn Oreyn and travel to Leyawiin. Speak with the guildmates and the barkeep at Five Claws Lodge and learn of their frustrations. Talk to Margarte regarding contracts. Collect Ectoplasm to convince Margarte of the Fighters Guild's reliability. Update the guild members on the latest developments. Return to Modryn Oreyn for your reward.","Modryn Oreyn[edit] After completing Unfinished Business, Modryn Oreyn gives you your next duty. Your fellow guildmates Dubok gro-Shagk, Rellian, and Vantus Prelius have apparently been getting rowdy at a tavern in Leyawiin, which is bringing the guild into disrepute. You're to head south to find out what's going on. ""Causing trouble, yes. Causing much trouble."" Five Claws Lodge[edit] Head to Leyawiin and ask around about the rebellious guildmates. Asking either local citizens or the members of the Leyawiin chapter of the guild will result in you being pointed to the Five Claws Lodge. Sure enough, the tavern has been taken over by the loutish trio, as evidenced by the overturned tables and chairs. The three drunkards are hurling insults at each other and trading barbs with the desperate innkeeper, Witseidutsei. Speak to Rellian or Dubok, who will both deny causing any trouble, instead blaming the situation on the Blackwood Company, and who will point you to Vantus. Vantus will explain that he is angry because the Blackwood Company has recently started to out-compete the guild for contracts, leaving them all out of work. It's clear the only way to get them to sober up is to find a contract for them. Equal Opportunity Employer[edit] Ask Witseidutsei or around town about any jobs that might be available and, as long as the person's disposition is above 40, you will be pointed in the direction of Margarte. Despite citizens telling you Margarte visits the Five Claws Lodge, she can in fact mostly be found either at her house just southeast of the tavern or at the Three Sisters' Inn. If she's not in town, she is likely just outside the western gate collecting ingredients. When you speak to her, she mentions that she is a trade consultant, but that her true passion lies in alchemy... if only she had more time to collect ingredients. If you ask her about Fighters Guild Jobs, she'll offer that she could use some Ogre Teeth and Minotaur Horns but isn't sure whether to give the job to the Fighters Guild or to the Blackwood Company. She suggests that if you were to find five portions of Ectoplasm, then the deal would be sealed in your faction's favor. Ectoplasm can be found on any type of ethereal undead, which includes all ghosts and wraiths. These enemies start appearing in undead dungeons from level 6. More conveniently, however, you will find five leveled ethereal undead residing in the undercroft of Leyawiin's very own Great Chapel of Zenithar, with ghosts appearing from level 1. If you require silver weapons to deal with them, in the local guild hall you can find two silver shortswords (one in the 2nd Floor West, one in the 3rd Floor West) and two silver longswords (both in the 3rd Floor West). Once you have collected the samples, return to Margarte, who will delightedly bestow her ingredient collection contract upon the guild. You're Hired[edit] Return to the three guildmates in the Five Claws Lodge, who seem happy to finally have some work and will thank you for your efforts. Return to Modryn Oreyn in Chorrol for your standard level-dependent gold reward, one Fame point, and advancement to Swordsman. Modryn will have no further tasks for you at this time and instead directs you to Azzan in Anvil and Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal."

After receiving the message about the great battle of Anvil Bay, travel to Smuggler's Cave underneath Anvil Castle. Find your way to Dunbarrow Cove and rid the Cove of the haunted Skeletons. Visit Dahlia Rackham of the Clarabella in Anvil Bay to purchase upgrades, including a crew. Once all upgrades are purchased the quest is complete.","A Great Battle[edit] When you start or load the game, you will receive a message: Centuries ago, a great battle took place in Anvil Bay. In the battle, the legendary pirate Torradan ap Dugal, the captain of the infamous Black Flag, was defeated by the first Count of Anvil. Rumors have been circulating of a hidden underground cavern beneath Castle Anvil. If the rumors are to be believed, then the final resting place of Captain Dugal and his ship have been uncovered. I should investigate these rumors as soon as possible. The map will be marked just southeast of Castle Anvil at a location named Smuggler's Cave. If you start a new game with this download loaded, the note and quest will be given to you right after you select your class the first time in the tutorial quest. The Secret Cave[edit] Head there and alongside the foundation of Castle Anvil you will see the door to Smuggler's Cave. Enter the cave and go straight; this leads to the door that opens into the inner zone named Dunbarrow Cove. The Red Sabre Pirates that were trapped here years ago have since died of illness and now their skeletons walk the cove, forever damned in anger over their grave misfortune. Lore of the Red Sabre[edit] You will have to defeat all seven Red Sabre skeletons, including the skeleton of Cap'n Dugal in the Captain's Quarters.  (This can be made quite easy by killing all of the skeletons outside, and then sneaking into the Captain's Quarters for a sneak attack on Cap'n Dugal.  Once you've done so, immediately go back through the door. For whatever reason, he doesn't follow, (He does follow in the latest edition on Steam) and when you re-enter, he will no longer be aggressive. This will allow for low level players, particularly with low health and weak weapons, to easily kill him off. Simply perform a sneak attack, leave immediately, and then repeat. He should die without issue.) In the Captain's Quarters you will also find four volumes of Cap'n Dugal's Journal which provides the back-story of Cap'n Dugal and the Black Flag. After you have defeated the undead pirates, you will receive a quest update saying you should see Dahlia Rackham of the Clarabella to hire a crew; the Clarabella is located in Anvil's harbor."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Elven_Maiden","Receive the next mission from Armand Christophe. Travel to the chapel in Cheydinhal, and gain access to the undercroft. Avoiding all guards, enter Lady Llathasa Indarys' crypt to steal the statuette. Steal the statuette, and return to the Imperial City, only to find yourself in a new predicament. Neutralize any suspicion of Armand Christophe by exposing a snitch in the guild. Plant the statuette in Myvryna Arano's cupboard then alert Hieronymus Lex. Persuade him to search Myvryna's home, and she will be arrested. Once that is done, Armand Christophe will promote you to the rank of ""Bandit"", and inform you of another doyen to take missions from.","The Mission[edit] Your next job consists of stealing a statuette made in memory of the recently deceased Lady Llathasa Indarys of Cheydinhal. It is only possible to start this quest after you have fenced 100 gold. Once you arrive in Cheydinhal, asking the beggars reveals that the statuette is located beside Lady Llathasa's crypt in the chapel undercroft of the city temple. The place used to be free to public access, but has recently been placed under guard by command of the town's count, Count Indarys. Recovering the Statuette[edit] Llathasa's Spirit The undercroft is guarded 24 hours a day by the Chapel Guard, an Altmer watchwoman who circles through the undercroft on her patrol route. If she spots you, she will attack you on sight even if you have committed no crime other than trespassing. Killing her will count as a murder, as well as invoking the blood price for the quest (usually 1000 gold). Therefore, the challenge in obtaining the statuette is sneaking past the guard. A decent sneak skill, perhaps coupled with an Invisibility or Chameleon enchantment, and good timing are key to success. Lady Llathasa's crypt is to the left, down the stairs. In the back of the alcove you will find the statuette (Llathasa's Bust) and a coffin (Llathasa's Tomb). As long as you only pick up the statuette you can sneak back out of the undercroft without incident, and return to the Imperial City. If, however, you also try to plunder Llathasa's Tomb (i.e., if you activate the coffin to see what's inside), you will conjure up Llathasa's Spirit. The spirit will attack you, which will usually alert the guard as well. The easiest way to avoid this is to simply not look inside the coffin; the one or two pieces of unenchanted jewelry in the coffin aren't really worth the trouble. Note that Llathasa's Spirit is a leveled enemy and its appearance will vary depending on your character level. From levels 1-8 it will be a Ghost, and from levels 9-11 it will be an Ancient Ghost. At levels 12-15 it will instead be a Faded Wraith, while at levels 16+ it will change to a Wraith. Some alternative options for obtaining the statuette are: Allow the guard to see you. Grab the statuette then run out of the chapel with the guard in pursuit. Run to the nearest town guard, who will act in your defense and kill her. Doing it this way will not incur a bounty since you only provoked her, and she was the only one who detected you, thus when she dies, so does your incrimination. Use calming magic such as Soothing Touch on the guard before she attacks, then run out. You will not incur any bounty from this and the guard will not follow you. You can allow Llathasa's Spirit to see you, and position yourself so that the spirit will attack the guard. The spirit can usually kill the guard and it won't incur a blood price. Since this was done in the undercroft without anybody else watching, you won't incur a bounty for trespassing. You can then just run outside followed by Llathasa's Spirit, and the townspeople will all gather around and attack her (although this risks killing numerous townspeople, especially since most of them cannot do any damage to the spirit). With the Knights of the Nine official download installed, if you have spoken to The Prophet and become a Pilgrim in the Nine Divines faction, entering the undercroft will not be considered trespassing, and the guard will not attack you unless she sees you take the statuette. This makes retrieving the statuette trivial; you can simply walk up to it and grab it while the guard isn't looking. A Setup[edit] Unfortunately, upon arrival in the Waterfront, you find out that Armand has been accused of stealing the statuette and has gone into hiding. Even worse, the Waterfront is crawling with guards including Hieronymus Lex. Talk to Isleif or Hillod in the Waterfront district and ask where Armand is. They will tell you that Methredhel is looking for you. If you don't run into her in the streets or while you're inside a building, visit Methredhel's house to find out more about Armand. Methredhel explains that your job was a setup in order to expose a traitor in the Thieves Guild. The traitor is a Dark Elf named Myvryna Arano (the same woman who delivers the invitation to the Thieves Guild). In order to turn the tables on her, you must sneak into her house (located on the Waterfront). If your sneak skill is good enough, you may be able to get into the house with guards around (just make sure the sneak ""eye"" shows that you are undetected); if your sneak skill isn't good enough, you will have to wait a long time before there are no guards around. Once inside, place the statuette in ""Myvryna's Cupboard"", which is the cupboard nearest the door and next to her bed. Then speak with Hieronymus Lex, who at this point should be running around the huts on the Imperial Waterfront, and convince him to search Myvryna's house. Lex's disposition must be at least 71 for him to believe you. Once this is done, Armand will be cleared of charges and will meet you at midnight in the Garden of Dareloth. He will then promote you to the rank of Bandit, as well as giving you the name of another fence, Dar Jee, in Leyawiin, far to the south. This is the last quest you will receive from Armand Christophe. If you ask him for more special Thieves Guild quests, he will tell you to see S'Krivva in Bravil."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Enter_the_Eliminator","Receive the contract from Ocheeva and the new ""medicine"". Travel to Fort Sutch and make your way to Roderick. (Optional) Remain undetected during the infiltration. Switch the medicine with the poison in the cupboard. Head back to the Cheydinhal Sanctuary to receive your reward.","Enter the Eliminator[edit] Speak with Ocheeva to complete the ""Enter the Eliminator"" mini-quest and receive your next contract. She asks you to kill the ailing warlord Roderick at Fort Sutch and gives you a bottle of poisoned medicine. Only by sneaking into the fort and replacing his medicine bottle with the poisoned one, while remaining completely undetected, will you receive a bonus. Two Paths[edit] The guards never sleep, so there is no best time to do the quest. Additionally, since Roderick, his four guards, and the medicine cabinet only appear after the quest starts, you cannot kill them beforehand. Finally, one-hit kills will not cause you to forfeit your bonus as long as you were not detected. At this point, you have two options on how to proceed in order to get the bonus. Quick and Quiet[edit] Travel to the fort, found north of Anvil. Enter through the main entrance, and proceed cautiously, as Gerard Melie can be found patrolling the initial area. After eliminating or sneaking past him, you have two choices to proceed: the main gate or the side gates. The large portcullis gate is simply opened by a nearby lever while the side gates require picking two locks. However, by taking this route, you are more likely to avoid the mercenary patrolling around the bridge. Whichever method you choose, you'll be on the upper level of the next room, and can proceed easily to the medicine cabinet. RemasteredOblivion Roderick on his deathbed Roderick on his deathbed Slow and Stealthy[edit] If you speak with Teinaava before leaving, you can learn about a secret entrance to the south-southeast of the fort. The fort appears to have previously had an abbey - while it is now in ruins, you can enter through what remains of the tower, and easily pass into the fort through some half-flooded tunnels. As Teinaava claims, the tunnels are unguarded and provide easy access to the fort. Be wary, however, of Laenafil, who is found patrolling the area you surface into. Thanks to the darkness of the tunnels and a convenient alcove halfway, even players with a low sneak skill should be able to pass unobserved. The recommended option, somewhat counter-intuitively, is to kill Laenafil (who is unleveled and has extremely low health) and take her key, which opens the gates on the upper level; rather than taking the unlocked path to the lower level of the room, which leads right to Ulmug gro-Cromgog and Neesha. If you opt for the low path, you can wait until they have finished their conversation and follow them to Roderick's quarters, where you will have a greatly-increased chance of being detected as a result; or slip by them with even just a few seconds of invisibility, giving you several minutes to do your work in peace. This is the main benefit to killing Laenafil, since if you take the upper path their conversation will not start until you pass above them, again making it possible to pull off the switch with no-one around. Just be careful not to run into them on your way out. Deadly Medicine[edit] The medicine cabinet is located in a brightly lit area, and is best approached from the right. Open the cabinet and take the medicine, replacing it with your poison. Backtrack to the exterior using any of the above routes and taking care not be seen. Report back to Ocheeva to receive your reward. Reward[edit] Return to Ocheeva for a level-dependent gold reward (up to 600 gold), a single Infamy point, and your bonus: The Deceiver's Finery, a leveled outfit that fortifies Speechcraft and Personality. This outfit is useful for the treasure hunt in the next quest."

Shaleez, a psychopathic killer and your new target, is hiding in the Flooded Mine just north of Bravil. The cave, as you may have guessed, is almost completely flooded. However, there are plenty of air gaps and you will not necessarily need any sort of Water Breathing ability. Make the Kill[edit] Shaleez might be swimming around the cave; if she sees you, she will attack on sight. The problem is that she will attack with an enchanted sword, which may be powerful enough to kill you very quickly. The exact sword is randomly determined; she will be carrying one non-enchanted shortsword, one enchanted shortsword, and one enchanted longsword (unless you do the quest at levels 1 or 2, in which case she will only have the non-enchanted shortsword). This problem is made worse by the fact that underwater fighting is very difficult compared to normal fighting. For an easier fight, lure Shaleez out of the mine where you have room to fight without being underwater. Shadowmere will also help if you manage to get Shaleez out of the mine.

Once you arrive, however, you will find that the city is in ruins. There is a camp of refugees at the bottom of the hill and Hirtel will greet you in haste as he is running away, explaining that the city was overrun by daedra the night before, and that a few guards are fighting back the creatures pouring forth from an Oblivion Gate blocking the entrance to the city. If you ask him about Martin, he'll tell you he assumes he's dead ""just like the rest of them"". The other inhabitants of the camp will be more helpful, telling you they doubt he made it out the city, while pointing you in the direction of Captain Savlian Matius. Venture to the top of the hill and you will find a few soldiers manning a barricade just outside the city gates. The ranking officer is indeed Captain Matius and if you ask him about Martin, he'll say he last saw him leading a group toward the Chapel of Akatosh. Closing the Gate[edit] At this point you can bypass the Oblivion Gate in front of the city gates and enter Kvatch. After dispatching the five Daedric enemies in the main plaza, you will then be able to enter the Chapel, where Tierra or one of the refugees will point you to Martin. Speak to him, explain what is happening and after some initial skepticism, he will believe you. However, he will refuse to leave with you, saying that he does not want to abandon the civilians to fend for themselves. You must therefore speak to Matius again, and tell him that you want to help, which will start the Breaking the Siege of Kvatch quest. Once you've closed the Oblivion Gate and led Matius's party inside the city, you will be able to free the survivors and get Martin to agree to follow you back to Weynon Priory."

The Budding Thief[edit] Raise your bounty somehow, and allow the guards to catch you and send you into prison. Shortly after being released (this may work if you escape) from jail you will be approached by a representative of the Thieves Guild, informing you of a meeting due to be held at the Garden of Dareloth in the Waterfront District at midnight. The Detective[edit] While traveling around the Imperial City you'll notice a lot of wanted posters around. Reading one will inform you of the Gray Fox, a master thief greatly wanted by the city guards. This adds a new topic for conversation with residents of the city. Talk to people and they will tell you that the beggars are the eyes and ears of the Gray Fox. Heading to the Waterfront District is the best way to find some beggars to question. Initially, they will claim the Gray Fox is nothing but a rumor, but after some persuading they will reveal the information about the meeting at the Garden of Dareloth in the Waterfront District held at midnight. The Conversationalist[edit] Go to Bravil and look for City-Swimmer, the Argonian. Talk to her about Bravil and you'll be taught a lesson about the law-abiding citizens of Bravil. You'll be offered two responses. Choose the second one: ""Gosh. Thieves Guild? What's that?"" Afterwards, you'll have a new conversation topic available: ""The Gray Fox"". Pick that and, like with the beggars, you'll be told to be at the Garden of Dareloth in the Imperial City at midnight.

Afterwards, take the note from Earana and head back to Cloud Top. Follow the instructions below to gain the Finger of the Mountain spell. (optional)","Chorrol Mages Guild[edit] Speak to Teekeeus in the Chorrol Mages Guild about a recommendation, and you will receive instructions to find out what is bothering Earana - an excommunicated sorcerer. In short, Teekeeus just wants her out of town to avoid any trouble. Talk to Earana[edit] Find Earana either on the street outside the hall, or at The Grey Mare near the main gate. Talk to her and agree to help her find a book, Fingers of the Mountain. Receive the directions needed to find it and inform Teekeeus about the book. He wants you to find the book for the guild before Earana does. Fingers of the Mountain can be found on Cloud Top, which is a ways northwest from Chorrol. Take the path that goes up the mountain directly in front of the north gate, keeping to the left at any forks. The book is located on the charred corpse. Return the Book[edit] There are two options at this point and both seem to lead to the same result, except for the amount of Fame gained: Option #1: Give the Book to Teekeeus[edit] Return with the book to Teekeeus to receive your recommendation and 2 additional Fame points. The quest will be marked as ""completed"" in your journal. If you are only interested in gaining access to the Arcane University, you have completed the requirements for such (although this may not be apparent; see Bugs). However, the quest update suggests that you should tell Earana that she won't be getting the book. You can delay getting back to Earana at this point, especially since there are no additional Fame points to gain, and Finger of the Mountain is a poor reward, being far more expensive to cast than a similar custom spell. When you speak to Earana, she will be very angry at you and will demand that you steal the book back from the Mages Guild, starting the quest ""Fingers of the Mountain, Part II"". If you refuse her request, this side quest will end right away and she will refuse to talk to you again. Otherwise, steal the book back from Teekeeus - he puts it inside the chest in his room. Give the book to Earana and she will translate it in ""a day's time"", but you should wait for 25 hours, as 24 hours doesn't always register correctly. You can anticipate Earana's demand to steal the book by simply following Teekeeus after you give it to him. If you do so, your sly efforts reveal the location of the container in his bedroom so that you can snatch it right away without looking too hard for it. Talk to Earana to start Part II, end the dialogue, and then wait for the quest to update before turning in the book to her. Alternatively, if you're good at sneaking and pickpocketing, right after giving Teekeeus the book, go into sneak mode and pickpocket the book off him. Note if you get caught, you will be in violation of guild rules and be kicked out. Option #2: Give the Book to Earana[edit] Give the book to Earana first: this will add 1 point to your total Fame. She needs to study the book for a whole day, and you should come back to see her again after that to get your ""reward"". She then departs to her room at the Grey Mare. Speak to Teekeeus and confess you've handed out the book to Earana: he'll ask you to steal it back. Go to Earana's room at the Grey Mare Inn and steal the book back from the chest behind the door - you can do this right away without waiting 24 hours for Earana to transcribe it as she will not notice the book has disappeared. As you open Earana's chamber door, she will usually get pushed on the right side behind it, making it easy to access the chest and steal the book without getting seen or caught. Hand the book back to Teekeeus, who agrees to overlook your transgression and send the Chorrol Recommendation to the Arcane University (no additional Fame point is given at this stage). Fingers of the Mountain, Part II[edit] For the optional second part of the quest (listed separately in your journal as ""Fingers of the Mountain, Part II""), return to Earana 24 hours after you've handed her the book to get a note instructing you on how to obtain your ""reward"" (a powerful new shock spell) for helping her out. You'll need a shock spell and a Welkynd Stone to obtain your reward. You can search within any Ayleid ruin, or any of the locations listed on the Welkynd Stone page, for a stone. If you don't have a shock spell you can purchase one from Druja in Skingrad's Mages Guild, where you can also find a welkynd stone in a display case. You should also bring some resist shock items/potions. Return to Cloud Top with the Welkynd Stone and prepare to cast a shock spell at the pedestal. You can use an on touch spell, but it is much better to use an on target spell so you can try and dodge the powerful counterspell that will hit you. Stand near one of the pillars that are situated around the site, drink your potions or put on your enchanted items just in case, then cast the spell and move behind a pillar. If you survive you will get a new leveled spell called ""Finger of the Mountain"". While the spell is leveled, it is also badly costed. All versions of the spell above the level 5 version are more expensive than any self-made spells, and can be extremely expensive to cast, bordering on impossible. Thus it's best to do this quest before level 5 if you want to make any use of the spell. After that, you can make your own version of the spell once you gain access to the Arcane University. Getting the Spell and Keeping the Book[edit] NOTE: In order to get the Fingers of the Mountain spell, as well as keeping the book and having it marked as not stolen, follow these steps. Please click the show button for tips, and remember to save your game before attempting: Tips → Get Fingers of the Mountain from Cloud Top. Go to Chorrol and give the book to Teekeeus. Give it to him while he is sleeping so that he will put it straight into his chest. Take the book from the chest. At this point the ""Join the Mages Guild"" quest is still active. Give the book to Earana. She will tell you to wait so she can translate it. Wait at least 25 hours. If Earana is not at the Grey Mare, find her by the Mages Guild. You will need to pickpocket the book from her. Talk to her so that she will give you instructions to ""shock the pillar"" at Cloud Top. Shock the pillar at Cloud Top, and get the Finger of the Mountain spell. Now you can freely drop the book as it is no longer a quest item, but it is still flagged as ""stolen"". Go to the burned body and place the book in its inventory. Close and re-open the burned body's inventory and the book will be there, free of any stolen flags, as it was when you first got it. The flag does not return. Notes The ""Join the Mages Guild"" quest will no longer be flagged for Chorrol. Also, Teekeeus never mentions the book again, and you get into the Mages Guild just fine. The ""cloning"" trick with scrolls works on it now, and the book has a weight of 2 and is still worth zero gold.  This method of saving the book takes advantage of a bug with the burned body.  The Unofficial Oblivion Patch addresses this issue.  The body is no longer a container."

If you refuse her request, this side quest will end right away and she will refuse to talk to you again. Otherwise, steal the book back from Teekeeus - he puts it inside the chest in his room. Give the book to Earana and she will translate it in ""a day's time"", but you should wait for 25 hours, as 24 hours doesn't always register correctly. You can anticipate Earana's demand to steal the book by simply following Teekeeus after you give it to him. If you do so, your sly efforts reveal the location of the container in his bedroom so that you can snatch it right away without looking too hard for it. Talk to Earana to start Part II, end the dialogue, and then wait for the quest to update before turning in the book to her. Alternatively, if you're good at sneaking and pickpocketing, right after giving Teekeeus the book, go into sneak mode and pickpocket the book off him. Note if you get caught, you will be in violation of guild rules and be kicked out. Option #2: Give the Book to Earana[edit] Give the book to Earana first: this will add 1 point to your total Fame. She needs to study the book for a whole day, and you should come back to see her again after that to get your ""reward"". She then departs to her room at the Grey Mare. Speak to Teekeeus and confess you've handed out the book to Earana: he'll ask you to steal it back. Go to Earana's room at the Grey Mare Inn and steal the book back from the chest behind the door - you can do this right away without waiting 24 hours for Earana to transcribe it as she will not notice the book has disappeared. As you open Earana's chamber door, she will usually get pushed on the right side behind it, making it easy to access the chest and steal the book without getting seen or caught. Hand the book back to Teekeeus, who agrees to overlook your transgression and send the Chorrol Recommendation to the Arcane University (no additional Fame point is given at this stage). Fingers of the Mountain, Part II[edit] For the optional second part of the quest (listed separately in your journal as ""Fingers of the Mountain, Part II""), return to Earana 24 hours after you've handed her the book to get a note instructing you on how to obtain your ""reward"" (a powerful new shock spell) for helping her out. You'll need a shock spell and a Welkynd Stone to obtain your reward. You can search within any Ayleid ruin, or any of the locations listed on the Welkynd Stone page, for a stone. If you don't have a shock spell you can purchase one from Druja in Skingrad's Mages Guild, where you can also find a welkynd stone in a display case. You should also bring some resist shock items/potions. Return to Cloud Top with the Welkynd Stone and prepare to cast a shock spell at the pedestal. You can use an on touch spell, but it is much better to use an on target spell so you can try and dodge the powerful counterspell that will hit you. Stand near one of the pillars that are situated around the site, drink your potions or put on your enchanted items just in case, then cast the spell and move behind a pillar. If you survive you will get a new leveled spell called ""Finger of the Mountain"". While the spell is leveled, it is also badly costed. All versions of the spell above the level 5 version are more expensive than any self-made spells, and can be extremely expensive to cast, bordering on impossible. Thus it's best to do this quest before level 5 if you want to make any use of the spell. After that, you can make your own version of the spell once you gain access to the Arcane University. Getting the Spell and Keeping the Book[edit] NOTE: In order to get the Fingers of the Mountain spell, as well as keeping the book and having it marked as not stolen, follow these steps. Please click the show button for tips, and remember to save your game before attempting: Tips → Get Fingers of the Mountain from Cloud Top. Go to Chorrol and give the book to Teekeeus. Give it to him while he is sleeping so that he will put it straight into his chest. Take the book from the chest. At this point the ""Join the Mages Guild"" quest is still active. Give the book to Earana. She will tell you to wait so she can translate it. Wait at least 25 hours. If Earana is not at the Grey Mare, find her by the Mages Guild. You will need to pickpocket the book from her. Talk to her so that she will give you instructions to ""shock the pillar"" at Cloud Top. Shock the pillar at Cloud Top, and get the Finger of the Mountain spell. Now you can freely drop the book as it is no longer a quest item, but it is still flagged as ""stolen"". Go to the burned body and place the book in its inventory. Close and re-open the burned body's inventory and the book will be there, free of any stolen flags, as it was when you first got it. The flag does not return. Notes The ""Join the Mages Guild"" quest will no longer be flagged for Chorrol. Also, Teekeeus never mentions the book again, and you get into the Mages Guild just fine. The ""cloning"" trick with scrolls works on it now, and the book has a weight of 2 and is still worth zero gold.  This method of saving the book takes advantage of a bug with the burned body.  The Unofficial Oblivion Patch addresses this issue.  The body is no longer a container."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Following_a_Lead","As soon as you complete the previous dead drop mission, a furious Lucien Lachance appears and explains the very serious rift that's been unknowingly set in motion. You are to travel to Anvil and uncover the root of the plot you have unwittingly assisted. Wait near the next dead drop until the courier comes, reveal yourself and demand the answers you deserve. Once you've been ""slightly"" more informed about the situation, head over to the lighthouse and speak with the lighthouse keeper to acquire the key to the cellar. Make your way outside around back to the cellar. Once inside you are treated to a non-living, breathing nightmare; search for clues and uncover the truth about this morbid plot. Meet up with Lucien at Applewatch - you find him... ""accompanied"" by the remainder of the Black Hand. Wait until a certain time and speak with Arquen to complete the quest and automatically start the final quest in the Dark Brotherhood quest series, Honor Thy Mother.","Your Bloodstained Hands[edit] Once you kill Ungolim, Lucien Lachance will run up to you in a rage and demand to know what you've been doing. He says you have betrayed the Brotherhood and must die for it -- but seeing the confusion in your eyes, he reluctantly concedes that you were not involved and tells you that your last few dead drops were not picked up. At some point the real traitor, the puppeteer of this murderous scheme, must have started replacing your dead drops with their own. He lets you know that you have been unknowingly and systematically killing all the other members of the Black Hand. J'Ghasta, Shaleez, Alval Uvani, and Havilstein Hoar-Blood were all Speakers and Silencers, and Ungolim was the Listener. He tells you that the surviving Black Hand members are hunting him because they believe he is the traitor. He tells you to go to Anvil and wait by the site of the next dead drop to find out who the traitor is. Thicker Than Water[edit] Go to the site in Anvil, back up behind the barrel, and wait in sneak mode until a Bosmer named Enilroth puts the Dead Drop orders in the barrel and you receive a new journal entry. Confront Enilroth. He swears he was paid to make the drops and tells you that the traitor who paid him was staying in the lighthouse under mysterious circumstances. If you want you can steal or loot the reward for the previous contract (500 gold) from him. Find the lighthouse keeper and obtain the cellar key (via request, thievery, threats, or violence), then head around the side of the lighthouse to open the cellar door. The Missing Hockey Mask[edit] The cellar is a nightmare, with various dead animals and people strewn about (and even a severed head marked ""Mother's Head""). Make your way through the cellar to the locked door; there is a crazed dog in the next room. Kill or sneak around it and find the Traitor's Diary. The ""Mother's Head"" on display It seems the traitor is actually another member and has been with the Brotherhood since childhood, sitting dormant the entire time waiting for the precise moment to execute a plan inked in blood. The traitor's mother was murdered by Lucien a lifetime ago as part of a contract and the traitor has endured the years growing more insane, conspiring along with his mother's head against Lucien, the Night Mother, and the entire Brotherhood. It is not known why the mother of the betrayer was murdered; the journal seems to hint that it was the traitor's father who originally put out the contract on her. Resist or Serve[edit] Now, head all the way northeast to Applewatch to meet with Lucien and explain the monstrosity you've uncovered. Once there, you will find that the Black Hand has tracked down and brutally murdered Lucien, believing him to be the traitor. Arquen approaches you, tells you that the traitor has been dealt with, and proceeds to promote you to Speaker in Lucien's place, presenting you with your own Black Hand Robe and matching Hood. However, because of the collapsing state of the Brotherhood, you and the remaining members of the Black Hand must travel to the Night Mother's sanctuary and seek her advice. Speak with Arquen again between midnight and 3am and ask about the 'Night Mother' to leave for the Sanctuary."

Speak with Varulae, who is standing on the main deck. She will tell you that the ship has recently returned from Summerset Isle with a family heirloom of hers, a crystal ball. Unfortunately, the crew of the ship has been murdered and their ghosts now haunt the lower decks. Varulae will ask you to go down to the cargo hold and recover her crystal ball. When you agree to help, you're given a key so that you may enter. You can either run this quest quickly, without a fight, or stand against five Spectral Sailors; as with all ghosts, they are immune to normal weapons. Inside the first door is a ghost that will sometimes stay in the room, so you can use a ranged spell to kill it easily, even at a low level.

Talk to him and go through his dialogue in order to receive a quest to kill twelve Rumare Slaughterfish. When talking to him, it is advisable to not select the option to laugh at him, since laughing will decrease his disposition towards you by 60 points and end the conversation. If you lower his disposition below 20, he will not even start a conversation with you; a Charm spell will be necessary to get his disposition over 20 and receive the quest. Gone Fishing[edit] Follow the quest marker to find and kill each fish. It may be necessary to search the area around where the marker points because it is not always accurate. The Detect Life spell is useful for locating the fish. It is also much easier to fish during the day. Once you've collected the scales from the first fish, the marker should point to the next one (there might be a short delay). If the marker doesn't update, try hitting the fish's corpse or leaving and waiting elsewhere for a few hours. Continue this until you have all twelve scales. The quest isn't timed and the fish don't move, so you do not have to complete it all at once. Talk to Aelwin again and he will give you a unique ring called the Jewel of the Rumare, which is enchanted with Water Breathing and Fortify Athletics 4 points, a rather nice reward for such a simple task. Retirement Savings[edit] Aelwin mentions that the fish scales will be sold to an alchemist and the money made will contribute to his savings for his retirement. If you are the thieving type, select the Where are your savings? dialogue option. If you increase his disposition to at least 70, he'll mention that his savings are locked in a box in his house and he has the key. After Aelwin tells you this, you can pick his pocket for the key or kill him and take it. The chest is located to the left of the fireplace in his house, though there is only a small amount of gold in the chest. Note that the key will not appear in his inventory if you do not successfully ask him about his savings."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Goblin_Trouble","Speak with the refugees at Crestbridge Camp to learn about a goblin war that has overrun their village. Get the goblins to stop fighting. Let the refugees know that they can return and rebuild their village.","Crestbridge Camp[edit] At Crestbridge Camp you will find a small group of farmers (headed by Barthel Gernand) who were trying to set up a new village at Cropsford, a short distance to the northwest. However, goblins overran their settlement; they would like your help in putting an end to the goblin skirmishing. Their guide, Mirisa, can give you the details: Cropsford is between two caves occupied by rival goblin tribes, the Rock Biter Goblins at Timberscar Hollow and the Bloody Hand Goblins at Cracked Wood Cave. They are fighting because the Rock Biter Goblins stole the tribal Totem Staff from the Bloody Hand Goblins. You have two options for how to stop the fighting: Steal the Totem Staff back from the Rock Biter Goblins Kill the shaman of the Bloody Hand Goblins These are the minimum actions necessary to stop the fighting, but you can definitely be more extreme (i.e., kill all members of both goblin tribes and get both tribes' Totem Staffs) if you're feeling bloodthirsty. Stealing Back the Totem Staff[edit] This option requires the least fighting (especially if you have good Sneak capabilities). The totem is in the depths of Timberscar Hollow, which will also be marked on your map by Mirisa. You are likely to find both Bloody Hand Goblins and Rock Biter Goblins at the entrance to the cave, but since they are busy fighting each other you can generally sneak past them. Inside the cave, find the Totem Staff, either sneaking past or killing the Rock Biter Goblins along the way. The totem will probably be in the possession of the War Chief. He picks up the totem as soon as the fighting between both goblin tribes ensues, so if you are quick you can grab the staff off the ground before the chief picks it up; otherwise you'll have to kill the chief to get it, which makes a stealth approach impossible. Once you have the Totem Staff, you have several options: Mirisa suggests that you give the Totem Staff to another goblin tribe, and start a new goblin war. You can keep the Totem Staff: it is an enchanted staff that does 20 pts Shock Damage (3000 charge, 111 uses, 7760 gold). You can return the Totem Staff to the Bloody Hand Goblins (leave it outside Cracked Wood Cave). You can even keep the Totem Staff until the quest is officially completed, then return it to the Rock Biter Goblins and watch as the war starts back up again on top of the hapless farmers. As long as the Totem Staff is not in the Rock Biter Goblins' possession at the moment, the goblin war is over. Killing the Shaman[edit] The shaman is located in Cracked Wood Cave, which Mirisa will mark on your map. You need to make your way to the depths of the cave to find the shaman, getting past about ten other goblins of varying strength along the way. The shaman has spellcasting abilities and is likely to give you the hardest fight. With the shaman dead, the remaining Bloody Hand Goblins (if there are any!) will lose their desire to keep warring with the Rock Biter Goblins. More to the point, they will also stop bothering to attack you, allowing you to leave the cave. This can be particularly useful if you used Sneak to get in and failed to kill the shaman silently. (The goblins coming to help the shaman will lose interest). Completing the Quest[edit] After halting the goblin war, return to Crestbridge Camp and talk to Barthel Gernand. He will thank you for your help. If you wait for Cropsford to be finished, you can go inside the larger of the two houses - the Bincals' House - and you will find a chest named ""Reward Chest"" on the second floor. This chest refills with gold once per week, and contains a leveled amount of gold (the amount will be ten times the character's level plus 0-19 additional gold). He also suggests that you return to Cropsford in a month for a ""Hero's Welcome"". The farmers pack up their camp, return to Cropsford, and proceed to continue building their settlement.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Great_Gate","You have 15 minutes to complete this quest. Enter the Great Gate and make your way to the World Breaker (the main tower). Ascend the World Breaker tower to the Sigillum Sanguis. Take the Great Sigil Stone to close the gate. Return the stone to Martin.","Time Limit[edit] RemasteredOblivion The Siege Crawler advancing towards the Great Gate The Siege Crawler advancing towards the Great Gate As soon as you step through the Great Gate, you will be given 15 minutes (real time) to complete this quest. Any longer and the indestructible Daedric Siege Engine will make it to Tamriel, resulting in Martin's death and the invasion of all Tamriel by Daedra. At that point, the game is over: you must reload an earlier save game. This quest can also be terminated if Martin dies while you are in the Great Gate Oblivion World (although the combat in Tamriel actually pauses while you are in there, so Martin can only die if he receives a fatal blow just as you step into the Gate). You do not need to worry about losing track of time: every minute, the game will post a reminder on the screen telling you how many minutes you have left. However, this countdown clock is actually one minute off: the first message you see tells you that you have 13 minutes left, when in fact you have 14 minutes left. This countdown will continue until it tells you that you have 2 minutes left (at which point you really have 3 minutes left); 65 seconds later, the countdown starts to update every 5 seconds (starting with one telling you that you have 115 seconds left). Fifteen minutes is a relatively short time to get through this world, but not so short that you need to panic. A normal run should take 10 to 12 minutes. Even if you get lost on the way to the main tower, as long as you make it to the bottom of the tower with two minutes to spare, you should still be able to finish the quest as long as you can avoid stopping to fight anyone. You can generally decrease the time it takes to complete this quest by: Using Fortify Speed; Casting Invisibility so that you do not have to fight enemies. More specific strategies are listed throughout the guide. Layout of the World[edit] When you first step through the Great Gate, you will see a huge war gate in front of you that is just starting to open. On the far side of the war gate is the ominous Siege Crawler, which over the next 15 minutes will slowly walk forward towards the great gate. The Siege Crawler does not pose any immediate threat to you, but will periodically shoot a volley of Fire spells at you, which can be deadly. The many fire towers in the area and the couple of Daedra accompanying the Siege Crawler can also be lethal. The World Breaker (the main tower) is directly in front of you on the far side of the Siege Crawler. Between you and the main tower are six peripheral towers, the World Breaker Guards: a line of three on your left, and a line of three on your right. The nearest four World Breaker Guards will take you to the main island. The furthest two World Breaker Guards each contain a switch on their top level that opens the final sets of war gates. Therefore, you will need to ascend one of those towers in order to gain access to the main World Breaker tower, unless your Acrobatics is high enough to jump around the gates. The one other feature of interest in this world is a cave system, The Smoke and Scorch, which leads you to the bottom levels of the final two World Breaker Guards. The exterior of this world is barren; there are the usual Oblivion plants and a few Dremora. Reaching the World Breaker[edit] Going through the Caves[edit] The most direct way to get to the main tower is to ignore the first four World Breaker Guards. Instead, run towards the Siege Crawler, following the left-hand (western) lava shore. It is possible to run along this shore without stepping in the lava, although you will be under constant attack from the numerous fire towers in this area; if you can survive some lava damage, you may also choose to just swim through, run over, or jump across the lava. Once you pass the middle pair of World Breaker Guard towers (probably shortly after you reach the Siege Crawler), jog to the west to get under the bridge. Continue north and you should run straight into the door to the cave system. This can be done in less than a minute. Fight your way through the caves into either one of the two final World Breaker Guard towers. Ascend the tower and activate the Gate Control. Closest World Breaker Guard Towers[edit] Enter one of the first two World Breaker Guard towers. This allows you to keep well clear of the lava and avoid a few fire towers. On the downside, you will have to fight or evade a couple of creatures in each tower, and waste some time running up and down and riding Corpse Mashers. Each tower has two doors leading to high-level narrow bridges that connect to the second set of World Breaker Guard towers. Descend in that tower to the lower level door, which lets you out onto one of the wide bridges continuing northwards. Alternatively, if you have high health or Acrobatics, after entering the second tower, take the door on the same level as the one you entered through to get to the bridge that joins the middle two towers and jump off. This method is quicker, but comes at the expense of health. Your next problem is that these bridges have collapsed - on both sides. You can try to jump across the broken spans, or jump down and make it across the broken terrain underneath. Surface Walk[edit] It is possible to make your way on the surface to the exterior doors to each of the final two World Breaker Guard towers. If you can jump the broken spans of bridges, you are on a path that leads right to the towers. Otherwise, you need to work your away around the many rocks and cliffs on the surface to reach the entrance. By taking the surface route, you avoid a couple of creatures and avoid a slow ride up the Corpse Masher. On the other hand, you can waste a lot of time finding your way through the rocks, and you also miss some of the little loot available in this world. Ascending the World Breaker[edit] RemasteredOblivion The Great Sigil Stone The Great Sigil Stone The World Breaker tower is a fairly standard Oblivion tower, with a Sigillum Sanguis at the top where you will find the Great Sigil Stone. In the lower level there is just one Dremora, the Sigil Keeper. If your lockpicking skills are poor, you will probably want to stop and kill him, because he possesses the Sigil Key that opens the Sigillum Sanguis. If you miss him, there is a second Sigil Keeper at the top of the tower. From the ground floor, you will enter the Vaults of End Times. Ascend the first corridor, watching out for the three guillotine traps. The corridor leads to a room with three possible exits. The way upwards is through the door on your left (on the south side of the room); the right door leads to a punished loot container guarded by an Atronach. Continue upwards in the main tower to the Sigillum Sanguis. In the Sigillum Sanguis, you probably want to stop and find two of the Punished, which contain treasure. Then grab the Great Sigil Stone. Like other quest-related Sigil towers, Sigil stones can be taken multiple times. However, this tower will only donate Great Sigil Stones, and Martin will only take one, so don't go overboard here or you will be left with useless items in your inventory. Back to Bruma[edit] RemasteredOblivion The battle is over, but the destroyed Siege Crawler remains The battle is over, but the destroyed Siege Crawler remains You will arrive back on the battle field underneath the Siege Crawler, which will immediately collapse around you when the Great Gate closes. No matter how quickly you complete the quest, the Siege Crawler will always have emerged partway through the gate. On the ground you will find a standard Sigil Stone, leveled as usual, that drops from the Siege Crawler when it shuts down. Sometimes you have to activate the siege machine to release the Sigil Stone. Help clean up any remaining Daedra or Dremora. Martin is once again essential, so do not worry about keeping him alive. If there are any other survivors of the battle, they will start clapping. Talk to Martin, who will take the Great Sigil Stone from you and tell you to meet him at Cloud Ruler Temple when you are ready for the next quest... ready to enter Mankar Camoran's Paradise. RemasteredOblivion A statue built in the hero's honor A statue built in the hero's honor When you return to Bruma from Cloud Ruler Temple, you will find a statue of you as the Savior of Bruma, located to your right when entering the city from the North Gate. The statue's appearance is determined (and it spawns) the moment you enter a ""new"" cell occupied by Martin. This will usually be when you open the door to Cloud Ruler Temple after he has returned there, but can also be on the road to it if you intercept him along the way. The armor and weapon will be the best quality items that you had in your inventory at the time, not necessarily the items that you had equipped. The game determines the ""best"" items - not just the most expensive items - taking into account enchantments; for example, the Dark Brotherhood Black Hand Robe has zero value but will take precedence over many other items, including some magical armor. The game calculates the value of items through its Gold Septims value, armor protection, and the amount of enchantments, in that order the latter being the ""best"". If you are very particular about the appearance of your statue, it is recommended that you leave all of your additional items in a safe place before talking to Martin. If you possess a quest item that cannot be removed that you do not wish your statue to wear, it is still possible to work around this; see the Notes below."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Hand_to_Hand_Training","Speak with Davela Hlaren in the Imperial Bridge Inn or Ra'qanar in Castle Cheydinhal to receive the master trainer recommendation. Reduce Helvius Cecia's health by half to prove you deserve his training.","A Skilled Fighter[edit] Once you have achieved a Hand to Hand skill of 70, head to the Imperial Bridge Inn, located east of the Yellow Road, to speak with Davela Hlaren, or to Cheydinhal to speak with Ra'qanar, to learn that if you wish to learn more about Hand to Hand combat you need to find Helvius Cecia, a Thieves Guild member who resides in Bruma. Before providing master training, Helvius will require you to prove that you have the skill to fight bare-knuckled. You must un-equip any weapons, and do over 73 damage to him in under 40 seconds (his health is 163, and you need to get it down to 90). Technically, you should attack Helvius with your fists but he won't be upset if you use spells, although this will completely defeat the purpose of the test. Draw a weapon, or take too long, and he will call off the fight and say you're not ready. Once you accomplish this, Helvius will agree to train you for a fee."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Heavy_Armor_Training","Once you have a Heavy Armor skill of 70, speak with Varnado in the Imperial City or Valus Odiil in Chorrol. Retrieve the items for Pranal at the Roxey Inn and give them to Malene in order to receive training.","From: ""Your Secret Admirer""[edit] The only advanced trainer who can give you the master training reference necessary to start this quest is Varnado in the Imperial City. Valus Odiil, although not a trainer, will also provide the reference. To receive training, Pranal first asks that you buy Malene (the Roxey Inn's publican) a gift. He is her ""secret admirer"" of sorts, and wants you to find a silver pitcher and four silver glasses. He gives you 50 gold to cover the expenses, but there is no requirement that you must buy the items. You can steal the silver pitcher from almost any home, although the silver glasses can be harder to find. Some places to find the items are: The Chorrol Mages Guild has more than needed to meet these quest requirements, and you can grab them without stealing once you've joined the Mages Guild: one of each lies on the table next to the entrance door, two of each on one shelf and three more glasses on another shelf in the second floor library. An additional silver glass can be found on a table nearby. In the ""Chapel Hall"" area of each city's chapel (except for Kvatch). The pitcher and all four glasses can be found in Alval Uvani's house in Leyawiin. If you've killed him for a Dark Brotherhood quest (or just on principle) you can find his house key on his corpse. One option is to steal the glasses and pitcher from the bedroom of Countess Arriana Valga in Castle Chorrol which contains five silver glasses and two silver pitchers. This task is made somewhat easier if the Canvas the Castle quest is active, as it gives you a key to the private quarters, allowing you to sneak around unchallenged. Norbert Lelles in Lelles' Quality Merchandise (Anvil Docks) happens to have exactly four silver glasses and one silver pitcher for sale. Novaroma in Bruma has three silver glasses for sale. Three Brothers Trade Goods in the Imperial City has a total three silver glasses for sale. Thoronir in Imperial City has a total three silver glasses for sale. These items can be found for free in the ruined Castle Kvatch. Rosethorn Hall's dining room has six silver glasses on a shelf against the south wall and a silver pitcher on the table. In Chorrol, three Silver Glasses and a Silver Pitcher can be found in Francois Motierre's house, while a fourth Silver Glass can be purchased from Northern Goods and Trade. In Skingrad, in the West Weald Inn, there are two silver glasses on the counter, two silver glasses on a table and five silver glasses in the cupboard, that's total of nine silver glasses, also there is a silver pitcher on each table. An additional five silver glasses and two pitchers can be found in Sinderion's cellar underneath the inn. The Tiber Septim Hotel also has a large collection of silver glasses and pitchers that could be ""borrowed"" for this quest. Umbacano Manor contains the necessary items. After you bring back the items, Pranal asks you to give them to Malene."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Hermaeus_Mora","Once you've met the requirements, speak with Casta Flavus, or activate the shrine directly. Hermaeus Mora will instruct you to collect one soul of each race. You will receive Hermaeus Mora's Soul Gem and the Mora's Soul Trap spell to complete this task. Once all souls have been collected, return to the shrine and activate it. You are rewarded with the Oghma Infinium which will permanently boost a series of stats that you must choose from a list.","Locating the Shrine of Hermaeus Mora[edit] If the requirements have been met, you can proceed directly to the shrine and begin. If you have not yet met the requirements, you will be told by Ri'Jirr: ""You have not yet followed the path required to speak with the Lord Hermaeus Mora"". Unlike all other shrines, you will not be given any clues as to what is required, nor will a quest be added to your journal. Once the requirements have been met, Casta Flavus will appear the next time you sleep and inform you that you are now ready to start Hermaeus' quest. Before you can activate the shrine and start this quest, you must meet the following requirements: You must have completed all 14 of the other Daedric Shrine quests. You must have at least started the Blood of the Daedra quest (the point in the main quest where Martin asks you for a daedric artifact). It is possible to have finished the quest, but that is not a requirement (in other words, it is possible to use this quest's reward, the Oghma Infinium, as Martin's daedric artifact). You can do this quest even if you keep Umbra in Clavicus Vile's quest (although you must visit Clavicus Vile's shrine and tell him that you will not give him Umbra, thus completing the quest). The Shrine itself is located on a remote plateau deep within the northwestern portion of the Jerall Mountains. It is due west of Cloud Ruler Temple and due north of Sancre Tor. Northwest of Sancre Tor, at the top of the long flight of stone steps, there is an unmarked road that leads straight to the shrine. The road's stairs and bridges make it possible to easily traverse the mountains, but several enemies will be found along the road. No NPC will give directions to it. Once you have found the shrine, activate the statue. Hermaeus Mora's statue is probably by far the most disturbing and mystifying of all the Daedric princes. He is depicted as a rotund bulbous mass; with four scorpion-like claws, as well as several tentacles and eyeballs. He speaks in an alarming, almost guttural voice: I see you have served my brethren, and now you come to serve me. I am Hermaeus Mora. Past, present, and future are as one to me. My followers seek to perform a divination. For this, they need souls, one of each of the sentient races. You will provide these. I give you a spell to trap these souls. Return to me when you have finished. When you do, I will further your journey on your true path. The Task at Hand[edit] Hermaeus Mora will ask you to capture one soul for each of the 10 races of Tamriel. He will give you Hermaeus Mora's Soul Gem and the Mora's Soul Trap spell. The soul gem will only work for this quest and it can only capture souls that are trapped with this unique spell. This spell is cheap to cast and lasts 120 seconds. One way to complete this quest if you don't want to murder innocent people is to go vampire hunting: Vampires are not undead and are classified as NPCs; therefore, their souls count. However, Argonian and Khajiit vampires do not exist. Try the Vampire Dungeons page for a list of places where you can steal vampire souls. If you haven't started fighting in the Arena yet, this would also be a good opportunity to gain all of the souls. Until you get promoted to Warrior, which is the fourth rank, every race appears at least once. You can also use the Skull of Corruption on any non-essential NPC and kill the clone before it disappears. This will, however, incur a bounty because using the Skull counts as assault. Some places where you can find NPCs of multiple races include: Daedric Shrines: Representatives of each race can be found at the various Daedric shrines, and they are generally easy kills, since most have no armor and/or weak weapons. Other than Olyn Seran at Molag Bal's shrine (who is the master trainer of Conjuration), the Daedra Worshippers no longer serve any purpose in the game. Each of the following links leads to a page listing all named NPCs of that race in the game; also provided are generic NPC enemies that can be of each race. Altmer: Necromancers, Conjurers, Marauder battlemages, Heretics, Zealots, Knights of Order and Priests of Order. Argonian: Marauder archers. Also, Veyond Cave (north of Bravil) is filled with hostile Argonian tribesmen. Bosmer: Bandit bowmen and Priests of Order. Breton: Necromancers, Conjurers, Bandit hedge wizards, Heretics and Zealots. Dunmer: Bandit bowmen and ringleaders and Priests of Order. Imperial: Marauder archers and warlords, the Hackdirt Brethren, Knights of Order and Priests of Order. Khajiit: Bandits and highwaymen. Nord: Marauders (inc. warlords). Orc: Marauders. Redguard: Bandits (inc. ringleaders) and Priests of Order. Return to the Shrine[edit] Once you gather all of the souls and activate the shrine again, Hermaeus Mora gives you a special book, the Oghma Infinium, as a reward and says: You have served me well, and I am pleased. I give you this, the Oghma Infinium. Knowledge given by me to Xarxes is recorded within. Read it, and gain knowledge of yourself. Go now. Learn, and remember. When read, the Oghma Infinium presents a choice of three paths: Spirit, Shadow, or Steel. You may choose only one path. Each path permanently boosts two attributes and three skills by 10 points each. Keep in mind that without an unofficial patch, the Path of Spirit has a bug which prevents it from raising Willpower."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Hircine","Once you have reached level 17, speak with Vajhira to find out that you will need a Wolf or Bear pelt as an offering to Hircine. Hircine requests that you bring him a Unicorn Horn. Kill the Unicorn in Harcane Grove and retrieve its horn. Bring the horn back to Hircine to receive your reward: the Saviour's Hide Cuirass.","Locating the Shrine of Hircine[edit] Hircine's Shrine is located in the Great Forest, south of the Imperial City. The location of this shrine can be marked on your map by: Speaking to Ontus Vanin using the topic ""Daedric shrines""; you must have already read Modern Heretics or have spoken with Ulene Hlervu about ""Cheydinhal"". An Offering to the God[edit] At the shrine, speak to Vajhira, and say you are a hunter. Telling her that you are prey will not have any repercussions, you may just speak to her again and say you are a hunter. She tells you to make an offer of a Bear or Wolf Pelt to the shrine. You also need to be level 17 to make the offer. Just search in any direction from the shrine for a Wolf or a Bear. One of the easiest guaranteed locations to find a bear pelt, is at the top right of the stairs in the Cheydinhal Fighters Guild. Once you have a pelt, return to the shrine. Hircine will tell you to bring him the horn of the only Unicorn in Cyrodiil. His dialogue is: Summoned by prey. The hare crouches before the fox's muzzle. Perhaps I shall task you, mortal. Set you to hunt for my amusement. In Harcane Grove is a quarry worthy of the chase. First named, last tamed, the unicorn runs wild there. Bring me this creature's horn, mortal. If you dare. The Task at Hand[edit] Harcane Grove The Unicorn is in Harcane Grove to the south-southeast of the shrine. There are three leveled Minotaurs of the Grove guarding the Unicorn. You do not have to kill the minotaurs. However, killing the minotaurs one at a time out of sight of the Unicorn makes it easier to complete the quest. The Unicorn can be a challenging fight, because it has a strong attack, multiple resistances, and Reflect Damage abilities (details are at the Unicorn article). As soon as you unsheathe your weapon (or raise your fists) it will automatically attack you. Some options for killing the unicorn (including some options that do not require actually killing it yourself) include: Use the Wabbajack on the Unicorn, which can turn it into a weaker creature. Bring essential followers to share your combat duties. You can ride the Unicorn to a town and place the Unicorn in the paddock next to the town's stable. You can freely attack the Unicorn from outside the stable with ranged attacks; it will not be able to hurt you. (Note that riding the Unicorn turns it into your active horse, as detailed in the Unicorn article). Ride the Unicorn to an Oblivion Gate or any other location with hostile creatures or NPCs, and let the enemies attack the Unicorn for you (as long as you do not draw your weapon, the Unicorn will engage anyone who is attacking).  Conversely, lead an attacking creature/NPC to the unicorn. Ride the Unicorn off a bridge or cliff into deep water. The momentum will ensure you plunge beneath the water's surface; remain underwater (using Water Breathing on yourself) until the Unicorn drowns. Do not dismount as the Unicorn will automatically swim to the surface. Riding into the water from the water's edge does not work because you cannot go underwater. Perhaps the most readily available method is simply to repeatedly leap off cliffs/down hills (while riding the Unicorn) until it dies from fall damage. The unicorn is a ""long creature"" and cannot quickly pivot to face you the way humanoids do. While it is turning, you can step to the side (""strafe"") to continue to flank it and hit it on the rump. The unicorn likes to do power attacks by rearing up and thrusting its horn. This, however, is a slow attack and you can often step back out of range and possibly dart in for an attack with a (long) weapon while its attack animation is finishing up. Returning to the Shrine[edit] Once you have the Unicorn Horn, take it back to the shrine to receive the Saviour's Hide, a light armor chestpiece with a 25% Resist Magic enchantment. Hircine will say: Yes, hunter, make your offering. Did you taste its flesh and drink its blood? Never waste the spoils of a kill. You've pleased me, hunter. Take my token, and wear it well. Hereafter, take your prey, and whisper my name. Visiting and attempting to activate his shrine after his quest will have this message appear: ""Go, my champion. May you be the last head on the Huntsman's wall."""

After having slain an enraged Maglir, return to Modryn Oreyn's house in Chorrol for your reward. Speak to Vilena Donton to be named Master of the Fighters Guild. Return to Modryn Oreyn's house and speak with him to complete the Fighters Guild questline.","Readying the Final Assault[edit] Once again, speak with Modryn Oreyn at his house in Chorrol. The Blackwood Company must be eradicated and Modryn tasks you with heading back to the Blackwood Company Hall in Leyawiin, finding Ri'Zakar and destroying the source of the Company's strength. You must be careful, however, as the Company now know your position and are unlikely to provide with a friendly greeting. Justice Is Served[edit] Travel to Leyawiin and enter the Blackwood Company Hall. Immediately Ja'Fazir will approach you and call you a traitor, after which all he and the other two Blackwood Company members in the room (Rana and Geel) will begin attacking you. Once you've defeated them, loot any items from their bodies (they often carry high quality and/or enchanted items) and particularly the key to Jeetum-Ze's room on the second floor from Ja'Fazir's body. Note that if you're having difficulties with the fight you can simply exit the hall and get some back-up from the Leyawiin Guard. Jeetum-Ze should be in his room but might only spawn after you enter and then exit his room (see Bugs). Regardless, deal with him once you find him and search his body for the key to the Blackwood leader Ri'Zakar's room on the third floor. Head on up to find Ri'Zakar seemingly in wait for you. Once you have slain him, search his body to find the Blackwood Co. Basement Key. The basement door is on the first floor near the stairs, so head on down there and make your way inside. We Don't Need No Stinking Water[edit] The room hosts a mechanized monster, with the Hist Tree in the middle connected to multiple pumping machines and run by a rotted screaming furnace. Two more Argonian mages (Sings-Like-Thunder and Hears-Voices-In-The-Air) are down here tending to the beast. Once they are out of the way, you must find a method to stop the infernal machine from working and put the poor tree out of its misery. To stop the machine, pick up the two Loose Pipes that are lying on or near the table by the furnace. Once they are in your inventory, activate one and then the other Sap Pump on each side of the tree. This should destroy both of them and you will get a journal update saying the tree has been destroyed. Exit the basement only to be surprised by your old friend Maglir, who is quite upset at you. He will rant about how you ""ruined everything"" and then attack. Once you have defeated him, make the long journey back to Chorrol and visit Modryn Oreyn again. A Glorious Return[edit] Modryn is beyond pleased at your news and says he plans to retire and work on some hobbies. He gives you the Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw as a reward, which boasts a fortify Agility and Endurance of 10 points and can take a ridiculous beating before needing to be repaired. Modryn also suggests you speak with Vilena Donton about what has happened. Head over to the Fighters Guild and find Vilena, who isn't very happy to see you as she's still fuming over your involvement in Viranus' death. She is most displeased that you have taken it upon yourself to plot the destruction of the Blackwood Company alongside the expelled Modryn Oreyn. As a result, she strips you of your rank of Champion. However, words cannot express how happy she is at the fall of Blackwood and the courage you displayed in taking them on. She therefore immediately promotes you to Master of the Fighters Guild and suggests you name Modryn as your second-in-command. Head back to Modryn's house and ask him for his services. Although he has become nothing shy of a savant painter in this short time, he will happily agree like only Modryn knows how. Master of the Guild[edit] At this point, the Fighters Guild questline is officially finished. However, you get to determine the guild's overall priorities as the Master. Your choice will affect the reward that gets placed in the ""Guildmaster's Chest"" every month (on the top floor of the Chorrol guildhall). At any point, you can talk to Modryn to change the guild's current priorities. Your choice will remain in effect until you tell Modryn otherwise. The choices are: Focus on recruitment: Your monthly gold is one half of the standard amount. However, you have a better chance of receiving random loot (10% chance 3 items, 10% chance 2 items, 11% chance 1 item, 69% chance no items). Focus on getting contracts: Your monthly gold is double the standard amount, but you only have an 11% chance of receiving a single item of random loot (89% chance no items). Focus on both equally: Your monthly gold is the standard amount. You have a 21% chance of receiving a single item of random loot (79% chance no items). The standard monthly gold is a randomly determined amount from 0 to 990 gold; it is not influenced by your character's level. The random loot is generated from a special leveled list. An item has equal chances of being any one of the following seven types: an enchanted bow; enchanted armor; an enchanted blade weapon; an enchanted blunt weapon; enchanted arrows; enchanted jewelry; or potions. Within each category, the specific item is randomly determined using the same leveled lists used to place loot in dungeons or equip NPCs. See Generic Magic Weapons and Generic Magic Apparel for more details on what types of items are included."

Locate and destroy the Uderfrykte Matron, loot the corpse to find Frostwyrm Bow, and learn of Agnar's fate.","Agnar's Journal[edit] At Dive Rock, near the campfire, you can find Agnar's Journal. This diary tells how Agnar the Unwavering became the chieftain of Thirsk Mead Hall on Solstheim and married Svenja Snow-Song, at some point after an earlier chieftain had rid Thirsk of the fearsome Udyrfrykte. (The earlier chieftain is actually the player of Morrowind, having done The Mead Hall Massacre quest in Bloodmoon.) However, Svenja was still haunted by the memory of the Uderfrykte and the possibility of future attacks, so to rid herself of her nightmares and fears, Svenja felt driven to slay the mother of all the Uderfryktes, the Uderfrykte Matron. Hearing of a horrible creature near Dive Rock, Agnar and Svenja traveled there. In the final diary entry, Agnar the Unwavering had just wavered and fled after his and Svenja's attack on the Uderfrykte Matron had failed miserably. Agnar was about to head back and avenge his wife's death. Uderfrykte Matron[edit] Head southeast of Dive Rock. Eventually, you will find Agnar's Body on a patch of snow near a large rock. You will find the Uderfrykte Matron in the surrounding area near the rock or in the small surrounding tree patches (map). Read Agnar's Journal: attacking with fire is the best solution; frost attacks are a bad idea; normal weapons will work but slowly. For a mountain-dwelling creature, the Matron seems to be rather bad at climbing. If you can stay on the steeper part of the slope above her, she will have great difficulty reaching you, so you can pepper her with fireballs and arrows in safety. If you want to loot the corpse afterwards, try to fight away from the cliff's edge: if she dies and tumbles you may never find the body. She appears more or less as a troll once you kill her. On the corpse of the Uderfrykte Matron, you can find Svenja's Frostwyrm Bow (unleveled bow, does 15 pts frost damage on strike) and her gory remains (essentially in the Uderfrykte's stomach). Agnar's corpse has fur armor, a silver war axe, and a small amount of gold."

Find and bring back 10 Welkynd Stones for Martina Floria at the Arcane University in order to receive training.","The Welkynd Stones[edit] Both Carahil and Kud-Ei will provide you the master training reference necessary to start this quest, even though the latter doesn't actually offer Advanced training. Speak with Martina Floria to find that she requires 10 Welkynd Stones in order to begin training.  The Welkynd Stone article provides a complete list of locations where Welkynd Stones can be found. Note that Welkynd Stones do not respawn without the Knights of the Nine plug-in, and are therefore a limited resource. If you have already used up all the available Welkynd Stones, you will be unable to receive training without using either the Console or the duplicate items glitch. Since she never leaves the Chironasium, it is impossible to receive training unless you are an Apprentice of the Mages Guild, and therefore have access to the University. It is also impossible if you are permanently expelled from the guild."

Report this to numerous guards and be directed to Itius Hayn. Find two witnesses and convince them to testify against the corrupt Watch Captain - Audens Avidius. After ten days, provided you are over level 5, Audens will find and attack you. Kill him and search his corpse for a note.","Complaints[edit] Talk to Luronk gro-Glurzog or his friend Ruslan, who both usually hang around in the Temple District, and they will complain about being robbed by some Imperial watchman while shopping at Jensine's ""Good as New"" Merchandise. Go to the shop in the Market District and talk to Jensine. If you raise her disposition to 70 she'll tell you the name of the soldier responsible - Audens Avidius. Report Avidius[edit] Report Audens to any of the guards around. They turn out to be of no use, as the culprit is a Captain and can only be arrested by someone of the same rank. That means you will need another captain's help to catch him.  Try the famous Hieronymus Lex if you have not completed the Thieves Guild questline. Lex is usually in the Waterfront District, but the quest arrow should point to him now. Speak to him, and he'll refuse to help too, as he's too busy with his search for the Gray Fox and will send you to another captain - Itius Hayn.  If you have completed the Thieves Guild questline go and talk to Servatius Quintilius. He follows a similar schedule to Lex, but the quest arrow should point to him.  When you speak to him he will tell you that he has only recently been promoted and is not willing to cause any trouble.  He, like Lex, will then tell you to go talk to Itius Hayn. You find Hayn in the city (following the quest arrow again).  If his disposition is at least 70, he'll tell you that you need to have two witnesses ready to testify due to the seriousness of the accusation. Get back to Luronk gro-Glurzog and Ruslan. The quest arrow should lead you to them. Raise their disposition to 70 to convince them to testify. If you ask Jensine to testify, she will refuse, regardless of disposition. Justice Served[edit] Now the quest arrow should point back at Itius Hayn, but you don't need to follow it. The next day, the witnesses will meet Itius for a brief moment. If you speak to Hayn after this he tells you that he shall arrest Audens Avidius. You can follow him until he does, but it is not necessary. The corrupt captain threatens to kill you, but afraid of Itius he peacefully goes to jail. The only reward for the quest is a fame point and an increased disposition with Jensine, but it is simple enough that you can finish the quest very quickly. Once you have persuaded the two witnesses to testify, the next part of the quest will play out even if you are not there. You can be doing something completely different, and at the appropriate time a quest update will appear telling you that Audens Avidius has been arrested. Escape from Prison[edit] After ten days, and when you are at least level 5, Audens Avidius will escape from jail, track you down and attack you. He will even follow you into the Planes of Oblivion, but not into the Shivering Isles (he will wait for you outside the Strange Door) or into locked buildings. He's poorly armed so you can kill him easily. In his belongings you can find a note saying that he escaped through the same route as you did."

Pick up your reward, a suit of Imperial Dragon Armor.","The Champion of Cyrodiil[edit] After the cinematic of defeating Mehrunes Dagon finishes, Ocato rushes in and realizes what has transpired. Although he is concerned over what will become of the Empire, he is grateful that (almost) everyone survived and names you the Champion of Cyrodiil, a title only six other heroes have received in the history of the Empire. Ocato orders a suit of Imperial Dragon Armor for you, which is normally only worn by the Emperor, and says the armor will be ready in two weeks. Pick up the Armor[edit] For two weeks, nothing happens in this quest and it has no quest arrow. After two weeks, your journal will automatically update telling you that your armor is ready. If you make it your active quest, you'll be directed to the Armory in the Prison District. Your new armor is on the table opposite the door. There are two different versions of the armor: one set of light armor and one set of heavy armor. You cannot choose which set you receive; the game decides for you based upon your skill in Light Armor and Heavy Armor. You will get the suit that corresponds to your stronger skill; if the two skills are equal, you will get the heavy armor suit. The decision is based upon the actual skill levels (not the base skill levels) at the moment that you get the quest update telling you that your armor is ready, and hence can be influenced by Drain Skill and Fortify Skill effects. Picking up any piece of your new suit of armor completes the quest, and also completes Oblivion's Main Quest. Congratulations!"

See quest section for requirements. Fences[edit] You will gain access to fences in a set order as you progress in rank within the Thieves Guild by completing the 'special jobs' offered to you by your Doyen.

Speak with Jeetum-Ze at the Blackwood Company Hall in Leyawiin to join their ranks. Drink the Hist Sap and kill the ""goblins"" that have ""invaded"" Water's Edge. Follow Modryn Oreyn's orders and speak with Marcel Amelion in Water's Edge to investigate the state of the town. Return to Modryn Oreyn to complete the quest.","A Double Agent Is You[edit] After Ajum-Kajin dies at Modryn Oreyn's house in Chorrol, Modryn tells you the next step is to infiltrate the Blackwood Company and its ranks so you can discover the secret of their strength. Jeetum-Ze[edit] Jeetum-Ze giving the orders Travel to the Blackwood Company Hall in Leyawiin and speak to Jeetum-Ze about joining the Blackwood Company. He will be suspicious at first as he has heard of your exploits with the Fighters Guild. However he quickly shrugs it off, remembering that several guild members, such as Maglir, have defected to the company recently. Follow him to the Training Room to get your first mission: tackling some goblins that have overrun Water's Edge. With your fellow company members lined up and ready to go, Jeetum-Ze hands you a special potion called Hist Sap. He will also explain its origin, telling you that the Hist comes from his homeland. If you ask whether the Company is involved in smuggling the sap, he will reveal they have supposedly brought a hist tree into Cyrodiil. After this he will instruct you to drink the potion and leave. As you cannot exit the basement (the door has a key-requiring lock), drink the sap and you will immediately receive a journal update saying that you feel a strange effect coming over you. You will then be transported directly to Water's Edge. Goblin Trouble[edit] Now on the ground, assist the other company members in killing all of the goblins around the settlement. You may notice that the ""goblins"" don't really behave as expected: they do not attack you and appear broadly harmless. Once all the goblins in the exterior are dead, one of the other Company members will tell you to clear out the houses as well. If you start to suspect what is really going on, you don't have to carry out this order. If you instead run far enough from the settlement, you will be relocated to where Modryn is and may continue as described below. In Oblivion Remastered, entering a house, seeing a peaceful goblin, and then exiting the house is also sufficient to advance the quest. Delusion and Death[edit] After you have killed all of the ""goblins"" or have fled the scene, you will be transported to Modryn Oreyn's house. Speak to Modryn and he will tell you that his men found you unconscious in the streets of Leyawiin. Upon hearing your story he will be deeply concerned and will tell you to go back to Water's Edge to find out what really happened. Head back to the village, which is along the road north of Leyawiin. You will find the town scattered with bodies, namely those of: Biene Amelion; Marie Alouette; Eduard Retiene, and Jolie Retiene. It seems that under the influence of the Hist Sap, you and the other members took them for goblins and killed them. Find and speak to Marcel Amelion, the sole survivor, who is mourning the death of his daughter Biene. Quest Complete[edit] Return to Modryn Oreyn's house in Chorrol and speak to him to complete the quest. He assures you that the slaughter at Water's Edge was not your fault, and proceeds to explain the next step: taking down the Blackwood Company."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Information_at_a_Price","Speak to Traven. He will tell you to go get some information from Count Hassildor of Skingrad. Upon arriving at Castle Skingrad, speak to Hal-Liurz who will bring the Count to you after some time. After speaking to Count Hassildor and learning of his problem, decide on a course of action: Kill the Vampires and get rid of the Hunters Go to Bloodcrust Cavern and kill all the vampires. Grab some vampire dust from at least one corpse. Talk to Eridor. Show him the dust, which will convince him and his hunters to leave. Help the Hunters kill the Vampires Find Eridor and tell him the vampires are at Bloodcrust Cavern. Wait for the hunters to go to Bloodcrust, and help them kill the vampires. Once all the vampires are dead, talk to Eridor. If he is dead, your only option at this point is to kill all the remaining hunters (if any). Kill the Vampires and the Hunters Go to Bloodcrust Cavern and kill all the vampires. Use the compass to find and kill the Vampire Hunters. Have the Vampires kill the Hunters Talk to Eridor and tell him that there are vampires in Bloodcrust Cavern. Enter Bloodcrust Cavern after your journal says they have been killed. Kill any remaining vampires. Talk to Hassildor to get his information. Return to Traven to give him the information.","Background[edit] Once you have been promoted to Warlock, speak to Traven for your next task. Count Hassildor of Skingrad has personally requested that you go see him to retrieve some vital information regarding the necromancers. Traven stresses that the good relationship between Hassildor and the guild must be maintained. Travel to the Castle Skingrad and arrange an appointment with the Count's new assistant, Hal-Liurz, in the County Hall. She says that he has been expecting you and will tell him of your arrival immediately, unless you have done the Vampire Cure quest and encountered the bug where Hal-Liurz gets stuck in the Chamber of the Lost, in which case you will have to go and find the Count on your own. If not, wait for her to return with the Count. If she doesn't return soon, and your compass indicates that she's traveling towards Kvatch, go to the map marker. The Count will be there, and you can continue with the quest. Now ask Count Skingrad about Information to learn why he has called you here. Apparently, your last encounter with him earned his trust—most of it anyway. He wants you to perform a task before he will give you the information. Hassildor says his problem is a minor one, but he doesn't want himself or his guards involved. It seems that a group of vampires has taken up residence in Bloodcrust Cavern to the east. In addition, rumors have spread that vampire hunters have come to town to take care of them. Both of these groups present a problem to the Count, and he wants them dealt with. Upon further questioning you'll learn there are four Vampire Hunters, led by a supposedly highly skilled Wood Elf named Eridor. Count Hassildor doesn't care how you deal with this second group as long as he himself is not implicated. Paying the 'Price'[edit] There are a few ways to handle this problem: kill the vampires and convince the vampire hunters to leave; send the hunters to Bloodcrust Cavern (optionally assisting them) and clean up anyone that's left; or just kill both groups yourself. Killing the Vampires and Getting the Hunters to Leave[edit] If you feel like killing the vampires alone, just head over to Bloodcrust Cavern and wipe them out. After they are all dead, grab some of their vampire dust. Then find Eridor (he will be the vampire hunter that is in Skingrad if you are using the compass). Talk to him about the vampires and show him the dust and he will agree to leave. Helping the Hunters or Cleaning Up[edit] First, you'll have to let the hunters know where the vampires are, and probably help them out a bit once they get there. Talk to Eridor and let him know the vampires are hiding out in Bloodcrust Cavern. If you want to ask him any questions, you'll need to raise his disposition. This is not necessary however, as he only tells you information you already know. The hunters will set off for Bloodcrust Cavern the following midnight once they've been given the information. The hunters are always equipped with leather armor and steel weapons, whereas the vampires' weapons and spells are level-dependent. The hunters are also significantly outnumbered, so at anything except extremely low levels the hunters' chances of winning are very slim. You'll receive a quest message if all the hunters are killed. This takes care of the first task if you are going for total obliteration of both groups. Continue on with or without the hunters, clearing the cave of the Bloodcrust Vampires. It isn't too big and once you kill all the Vampires you'll get a quest message. If Eridor survived, and you have dust from at least one of the vampires, talk to him and the group will leave town. This is essentially the same as the first option, but provides you with some support. Unfortunately, if Eridor does not survive, the only way to get rid of any remaining Hunters is to kill them all. If the hunters do manage to kill the vampires, you'll have to take care of the hunters yourself. Killing the Vampires and Murdering the Hunters[edit] Once again, just go to Bloodcrust Cavern and kill all the vampires. After that, use the compass to find and eliminate the vampire hunters. If you choose this path, these tips may help. Getting the Information[edit] Once all of the vampires and hunters are taken care of, return to the Count with the news (speak with Hal-Liurz again to arrange a meeting). Count Hassildor will finally tell you the information he has for the guild. He says the necromancers are but a sign of things to come and the Mages Guild is in great danger. It seems that Mannimarco, the nearly invincible leader of the Necromancers, has returned. Return to Traven and tell him the bad news. He will say that the Council needs to deliberate on this matter. As such, you won't be able to get a new task for two days."

Work your way through the caves, defeating members of Blackwood as you go. When you reach Ajum-Kajin, talk to him and he will agree to follow you back to Modryn. Return to Modryn's house and speak with him. You must do whatever is necessary to make Ajum-Kajin talk. Ajum-Kajin will answer the first two questions, but will kill himself rather than answer the third. Talk to Modryn Oreyn again. He will give you an Amulet of Interrogation as your reward.","Kidnapping Is a Fine Art[edit] Make your way to Chorrol and visit your old friend Modryn Oreyn. By now, the Blackwood Company is getting out of hand, and they must be brought down for the good of the Fighters Guild and the general public. Unfortunately, it's hard to tell where to start or what the source of their power is. Modryn tells you that a high-ranking member is currently holed up in the nearby Glademist Cave and that kidnapping him could yield valuable information. As this particular Argonian is very high up the chain of command and well guarded, however, he will make a difficult target. Hand Me the Calipers[edit] Head to Glademist Cave, which is northeast of Chorrol along the Orange Road. Make your way inside and fight your way through the fairly linear dungeon (see the place page for full walkthrough info). You will need to fight past seven well-equipped Blackwood Company Guards until you reach the final chamber, where you will find Ajum-Kajin. As long as all of his guards are dead, he will reluctantly follow you back to Chorrol. Make your way back to Modryn's house and tell him that you've brought Ajum-Kajin with you. Modryn orders you to sit the Argonian down and get the information you need about Blackwood from him one way or another. Once you tell Ajum-Kajin to sit down, he'll immediately realize what your plans are, giving you the silent treatment from here on in. After he sits down, you have two choices to gather information from him: sweet-talking him or beating his life out on the wall. Option 1: Speech Deception[edit] Speak with Ajum-Kajin and raise his disposition up to 90. This can be accomplished through Persuasion, Charm spells or bribes. Once he is friendly enough with you, exit his dialogue screen (which initially features no conversation topics) and you'll receive a journal update stating he is ready to talk. Ask him all three questions at your disposal: the size of the Company, its leader's name and the source of its strength. He will answer only the first, informing you that the Company is now one hundred strong. Exit the talk screen and you'll once more receive a journal update stating he is ready to talk again. Ask him the remaining two questions, of which he will again answer only the first, betraying the name of his leader: Ri'Zakar. Option 2: Painting the Walls Red[edit] For this method, a fists-only approach works best, as Ajum-Kajin may inadvertently die from weapon attacks before he answers all your questions. After a few decent licks, you'll receive a journal update stating he is ready to talk. Ask him all three questions (see option above for detail), of which he will answer only the first. Exit the dialogue screen and after a few more blows, you'll get another journal update stating he is ready to spill something other than blood. Ask him the remaining two questions, of which he will again only answer the first. Loyalty Burns[edit] After Ajum-Kajin has answered two of your questions he will choose suicide over further betrayal. Using his hidden Blackwood Ring of Silence, he quickly burns himself alive on the spot. After the Argonian roasts, Modryn Oreyn is only partly satisfied by the intelligence gathered: the Company's source of strength is still a mystery. He tells you that the next step is thus to infiltrate the Company's ranks so you can investigate the answer to that final question. He also rewards you with a leveled amulet called the Amulet of Interrogation, which fortifies Hand to Hand and Speechcraft (note that due to a bug you will actually receive the most powerful version of this amulet between levels 5-9). You do not receive any gold reward or fame for this quest, though you will find some gold on Ajum-Kajin's corpse (including any gold you may have previously used to bribe him). If you killed Ajum-Kajin, Oreyn will be displeased and will not reward you with the amulet."

Antus becomes disappointed when he hears Valus is not coming. Follow the sons a bit east down the road to their Odiil Farm, past the farmhouse, and wait with them at their vegetable patch. Not long after they reach the vegetable patch, three waves of goblins will attack, two of three and one of four. The exact level and type of goblins will depend on your level. The sons are hardy, but they can easily fall if you aren't careful. Keep an especially close eye on Antus, who tends to rush into battle. A horse can be a useful ally during this fight, as they will draw attacks from several goblins at once and help prevent the brothers from being overwhelmed. Shadowmere is ideal for this, as she is essential and therefore cannot be killed. Reward[edit] Check the farmhouse after the battle to find a Nirnroot (see quest Seeking Your Roots) in a pot (also note there are a lot of vegetables in the garden that are yours for the taking).

A copy of the key can also be found in the Leyawiin Mages Guild, on the second floor. The Target[edit] Your 7th Dead Drop Order involves the assassination of a Wood Elf named Ungolim in Bravil. He visits a certain statue there - the statue of the Lucky Old Lady - every night between 5pm and 1am. During the day he can be found in his house, however the door is locked and can only be opened with the key, which he carries. Although difficult, you can pickpocket the key from him before the quest begins. He is expecting trouble, and he has paid off the guards so that they will not interfere whenever things get nasty. Make the Attack[edit] The moment you set foot in Bravil at night, Ungolim will attack you on sight with his bow. You do not have to worry about getting a large bounty or getting into additional fights with the Bravil guards due to Ungolim's bribe. Simply kill Ungolim however you see fit to complete the contract. If you are having trouble with Ungolim pelting you from afar, simply run over to the main gate and stand behind one of the guards - due to the way the AI follows you with a bow, it's no problem to just sidestep behind a guard right as Ungolim fires, sending the arrow into the guard.

If you ask him about contracts, he will explain: ""A contract is a pact one enters into with the Dark Brotherhood. They provide us with the gold, and we remove someone from existence. A contract is fulfilled by a skilled assassin such as yourself, who keeps the Dark Brotherhood's end of the bargain. So it has always been. While carrying out a contract, you may have the opportunity to earn a bonus if certain parameters are met."" And if you inquire more about the bonuses offered during a contract, he will elaborate: ""Some contracts are straightforward. Find the target, eliminate them, then return to the Sanctuary. No time limits or complications. However, many of our clients request that their contracts be carried out in a specific manner. A certain place, a certain method of elimination. We try to honor this requests whenever possible. After all, the Dark Brotherhood's reputation has been built on providing... good service. Any Brother or Sister who can complete a contract while fulfilling a specific request will receive a valuable bonus, oftentimes a powerful magic item."" Once you accept your first contract from Vicente, the quest A Watery Grave will begin."

Travel with Mazoga to Telepe and kill all the bandits. Report to Marius. Return Black Bows to Marius for a bounty.","The Target[edit] Speak to Count Marius Caro after completing Mazoga the Orc's quest to begin this quest. The Count wants you to kill an Orc outlaw named Black Brugo, chieftain of the Black Bow Bandits. He'll suggest speaking with Mazoga, who may have contacts with outlaws due to her shadowy past. Speak with Mazoga and you'll learn that she knows Brugo, that his hideout is an Ayleid ruin west of Leyawiin called Telepe, and that he visits there between midnight and 6am (see Notes). Keep in mind, he may arrive early; sometimes shortly after 8pm. Mazoga will wait in the Castle Hall until you ask her to follow you. The Black Bow Bandits[edit] Travel to Telepe (northwest of Leyawiin and a short distance southwest of the White Stallion Lodge) and kill Black Brugo and his gang. The ruins are quite small and contain two of Brugo's henchmen. Brugo and his friends Alonzo and Roxy Aric are located nearby after you enter the cell if you arrive at the time indicated above, so the action begins quickly. They will enter the ruin, however. If you arrive at 8am or shortly afterwards, you will see Brugo, Alonzo, and an invisible Roxy Aric heading out to the ambush site a bit north of Telepe near the road. This offers new tactics; as long as you walk behind them, they don't attack until arriving at the ambush site (even if they shout alarm phrases), so you can fight them  one at a time, making the fight a lot easier. After killing Brugo, be sure to take the key that he carries. It unlocks an Ayleid Coffer in Telepe containing 300 gold and a quest-related note which you would otherwise have to pick open. After the battle, Mazoga is quite excited that she'll soon be a real knight, even though she apparently does not know how to be one or even what a knight-errant is, and says she'll meet you in the Castle Hall. Note that, before she starts traveling on her own, you will first have to lead her outside and away from the ruins. Become a Knight[edit] Report to Marius to become a Knight-Errant of the Knights of the White Stallion, receive a Leyawiin guard's shield and the key to White Stallion Lodge. He also promises a bounty of 100 gold for every Black Bow you deliver to him. If you speak to Mazoga after this, she will tell you that she will be at the White Stallion Lodge, after which she leaves the Castle Hall and then Leyawiin itself. After the quest, Mazoga will say ""I'm gonna go get me some black bows. Tag along if you like.""  This initiates the freeform quest Black Bow Bandits."

Take the brothers to Weatherleah and receive your reward.","Receiving Quest[edit] After reuniting Guilbert and Reynald Jemane in Separated at Birth, talking to Guilbert reveals the quest to help them reclaim their childhood home of Weatherleah. They say that their family was run off one day by Ogres, hence the separation. They can't remember where it is except that it was ""South of Chorrol, north [sic] of Fort Carmala."" However, it is actually southwest of Fort Carmala. Recover Weatherleah[edit] Asking around town will direct you to Sabine Laul who is a local explorer and member of the Fighters Guild.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Leyawiin_Recommendation","Speak with Dagail and agree to help locate her missing amulet. Ask Agata about Dagail's troubles. She says you should inquire of the other mages. After asking around and making note of Kalthar, return to Agata. She asks you to speak with Dagail once more. Determine that you can find a replacement amulet in Fort Blueblood. Fight through the fort and retrieve the amulet. After the ensuing confrontation, return to Dagail with the amulet and receive your recommendation from Agata.","Leyawiin Mages Guild[edit] Speak with Dagail in the Leyawiin Mages Guild about your recommendation. She wants you to find her amulet for her and directs you to Agata. Speak with Agata about a Seer's Stone, which helped Dagail with her visions. Agata says to speak with the other mages in the guild to see if any of them knows where it might be. Asking around the guildhall members will reveal more information about Dagail. Residing Alchemist, Alves Uvenim will say: ""She was a very powerful mage once, from what I understand. Hard to imagine that, honestly."" and will add: ""Agata is the first person I go to when I need something. Maybe I should talk to Dagail instead, but I just don't feel comfortable doing that."" The other residing Alchemist, S'drassa, will give you his take on her: ""A nice lady, but strange. Talks to herself far more often than one should, in my opinion. Sometimes I wonder why she hasn't just retired, and gone someplace to rest."" About Agata, he will comment: ""She's been a great help to all of us in the guild. Without her, I think Dagail would be lost at times."" All guild members will hint you towards the resident most dissatisfied with the leadership of the Guildhall, Kalthar. When asked about Dagail he will say: ""I heard she was put in charge of the Leyawiin guild hall as a favor, not because she deserved it. That doesn't seem right, does it?"" and on Agata, he will say: ""She's the one you want to talk to if you actually need something to get done around here. I don't even know why Dagail is still around."" When asked about the amulet, he will finally break down and get angry, in the process revealing a few bits of important information: ""Well, well. Word is finally spreading, is it? They won't be able to keep up this facade much longer! Yeah, I know all about it. I overheard Agata and Dagail talking. And you know what? I'm glad it's gone! Why should we be forced to work under someone who's only kept sane by a magical trinket? Haven't we sacrificed enough already? She shouldn't even be here anymore. Hell, the only reason her father ever fit in anywhere is because he kept a low profile. And look what it got him! Years of service to the Empire, and not even a tombstone over his head! Hrmph. At least he was able to maintain the illusion of sanity. I know, I get way too fired up over this. It just annoys me that she's in charge of the guild, when she's clearly not fit. That's all."" Return to Agata with what Kalthar said. She'll agree to keep an eye on Kalthar and wants you to speak to Dagail about her father. Dagail doesn't make too much sense, but apparently you must find the fort where Dagail's father was stationed, somewhere near Leyawiin. Fort Blueblood, a little ways southeast of town, is now marked on your map. Fort Blueblood[edit] The fort is full of marauders. Make your way through until you find the main camp, containing a tough Marauder Warlord. Kill him for a key (or steal it from him) to open a nearby door. Within this area you'll find Manduin's Coffin, in which will be Manduin's Amulet, the one for which Dagail is looking. Worth Dying For[edit] Once you find the amulet you'll be confronted by Kalthar, who will demand the amulet. He'll confess to stealing the amulet in an effort to see Dagail dismissed as leader of the Leyawiin Mages Guild and duly attack you. Deal with him and loot his key from his body.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Liberation_or_Apprehension%3F","Speak to Arch-Mage Traven who tells you to find Mucianus Allias and some Battlemages at Nenyond Twyll. Once you arrive, talk to Fithragaer—the only Battlemage remaining. Explore Nenyond Twyll until you find Mucianus Allias, who has been turned into a unique zombie called a Worm Thrall. Return to Traven with the sad news concerning Mucianus. Go visit Raminus for advancement to Warlock.","The Name's Allias[edit] Speak to Arch-Mage Traven after completing the quest Necromancer's Moon. He speaks of how you've shown great promise and such, then gets down to the business of your next quest. It seems that in their efforts to gain information about the Necromancers, the Mages Guild has enlisted Mucianus Allias as a spy within the organization. This move has given the guild valuable information, but Traven now feels that the informant is in danger. In particular, Traven is worried that a group of Battlemages sent to find Mucianus by the Council of Mages will mistreat him or even mistake him for one of the necromancers. To prevent this Traven sends you to Nenyond Twyll—Mucianus' last known location—an Ayleid ruin to the south of the Imperial City. Fithragaer[edit] Once you travel to the ruins and step inside, you meet what remains of the Battlemages—namely, a Bosmer called Fithragaer. According to him, the necromancers were ready for the battlemages and ambushed them. This obviously doesn't sound like good news for the informant. Still, Fithragaer is eager to continue the fight and he tells you to follow him. This turn of events only lasts a few seconds, as Fithragaer steps onto a platform that rises rapidly into the air and impales him on spikes attached to the ceiling. The platform is on the bottom of the first set of steps, in the center of the room. Now you'll be searching for Mucianus alone. Move Fithragaer’s corpse off the trap so his body doesn’t keep triggering it. It is possible to keep Fithragaer alive, but his death is scripted, and doing so may bug the game. The Rest of the Ruin[edit] After passing the trap, the rest of the quest is straightforward. Just make your way past the three necromancers and toward Nenyond Twyll Riellesel. In there, you'll find a necromancer named Mariette Rielle. Surprisingly, she doesn't attack you on sight. Speak with her if you want to, or you can attempt to get a sneak attack in first. If you do choose to talk, Mariette will tell you that Mucianus Allias has been turned into a Worm Thrall (a Zombie), and then she will attack you. After you kill her, hit the switch on the northwest wall beyond the pool to open a nearby door. Behind the door is Mucianus who—as Mariette rightly claimed—is now a Worm Thrall. Attempt to talk to Mucianus. Sadly, there is no way to help him, so the only thing you can do is head back to the Arcane University and report what happened. Don't forget to speak with Raminus for a promotion to Warlock. He will tell you that you can now access the Council Chamber—the second floor of the Arch-Mage's Tower—freely, but in fact the chamber is accessible at the previous rank of Magician."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Lich_of_Lost_Boy_Cavern","Note: This quest does not appear in your journal. Also, it is best to only start this quest if you are level 23 or higher; otherwise, you will never be able to complete the quest. Find and read the items that tell the story of Erandur and Vangaril. Combat the lich.","The Story[edit] You will first find a Weathered Journal outside the front door to the Lost Boy Cavern. This journal was written by a Mage, Vangaril, and describes his realization that his friend Erandur has become a Lich. The Mages Guild refuses to help Vangaril, so he resolves to enter Lost Boy Cavern alone and free Erandur's soul. The second installment is on a crumpled piece of paper in Lost Boy's Yawning Halls (near an overturned chair). This missive is somewhat incoherent. The third note is another Crumpled Piece of Paper near an overturned chair, this time in Lost Boy Canyon. This note is apparently a taunt written by Erandur, promising (somewhat prophetically) to consume Vangaril from within. Chronologically, a Folded Page is next. Two identical copies of this paper can be found in Lost Boy's Hidden Bastion (one in the easternmost room, one in the westernmost room). This paper states that Vangaril successfully completed the rites to free Erandur's soul. But apparently, he was not successful. In a workroom in Lost Boy's Hidden Bastion are Vangaril's three attempts to write his final message to his Mages Guild superiors. The first, an open letter to the Guild of Mages, is a formal and respectful letter which explains how an evil took root within him. This letter is not complete, and was crumpled and abandoned by Vangaril. The next attempt, A letter for the Once Great Mage's council, is a more aggressive note, blaming the Mages Guild for not training Vangaril enough to properly banish Erandur. This letter, too, is crumpled and disregarded. The final note, a pristine An open threat to the Guild of Mages, is written by the Lich Erandur-Vangaril: evidently the lich was not truly banished, but instead managed to incorporate the souls of both Erandur and Vangaril. The final note, making references to both Kvatch and Mannimarco, threatens that he will kill every member of the Mages Guild. The Lich[edit] In the final room of this cave you will meet the Lich Erandur Vangaril. If you have been collecting the various notes scattered throughout the cave, you will have learnt a fair bit about the history of this creature. If you are level 23 or higher, you have a chance to avenge Vangaril and kill the Lich. At lower levels, you can explore the entire cave, but you will be unable to fight the Lich: you will find an ethereal being identified as Erandur-Vangaril but be unable to interact with it in any way—even if you later return at a higher level. See the bugs on Erandur-Vangaril's page for details."

The Countess informs you of an artifact that she wants you to recover. Follow the map past all the markers until you reach the underground tunnel to Pale Pass. Make your way through the fort. You will soon meet Akaviri Commander Mishaxhi. Deal with him and recover the artifact from the same room. Return to the Countess with the amulet to receive your reward.","The Draconian Madstone[edit] Map to the Pale Pass entrance, as penned by an Akaviri messenger Dragonclaw Rock(Oblivion Remastered) Once your fame is at least 10, you may hear rumors in Bruma about the Countess and her collection of Akaviri artifacts. Talking to townspeople about the subject will direct you to the Countess's herald, Tolgan, for further information: ""Her steward, Tolgan, occasionally approaches individuals the Countess feels is worthy enough to seek her prize. If you're interested in assisting the Countess, you can always seek out Tolgan. He's usually in the Castle."" Additionally, you can hear rumors in conversation in Bruma once your fame is at least 10: ""I overheard a guard mention the Countess is looking for a piece to add to her collection of Akaviri artifacts. Our taxpayer's drakes at work..."" Even if you know that Tolgan will hunt you down, talking to Narina will net you: ""I think I know why you're here, but I'd speak to my herald, Tolgan, first. I believe he has something for you. Then return to me."" Such effort may not even be necessary, as Tolgan himself is actively seeking you out. He tells you that the Countess would like to speak to you and hands you a stipend of 25 gold coins: ""Good day. I'm Tolgan, herald to Countess Narina Carvain here in Bruma. She requests your company at your earliest convenience."" What's this regarding? ""Countess Carvain would prefer if you speak to her in person. She also said to present you with this stipend as a taste of things to come. My Lady holds court from 8 in the morning until 6 in the evening each day. That would be the best time to see her."" When you meet the Countess, she will inform you of her task: retrieve the Draconian Madstone. As a reward, she offers another item from her own collection. Once you accept the task, she reveals that she has the diary of a messenger sent to Pale Pass, the last known location of the Draconian Madstone. Talk to her about the topic ""Diary"". She tells you that she has already sent scouts looking for Pale Pass, and they found the first of the landmarks mentioned in the pages of the diary, Dragonclaw Rock. The Countess gives you a translation of the messenger's diary and a copy of a map sketched in the diary; a marker for Dragonclaw Rock is added to your map.  Following the Map[edit] RemasteredOblivion The Sentinel The Sentinel Travel to the place that the Countess marked. The rock looks just like its namesake, a giant lizard foot. Whether you read the diary doesn't matter; your next step is to go due west from the dragon foot until you find a large statue called The Sentinel, the second landmark. From The Sentinel, go due north. It shouldn't be long until you find the third landmark, Serpent's Trail. The Serpent's Trail is an underground tunnel leading to Pale Pass. See the Pale Pass article for a map of this area. You may also find the messenger who penned the diary that has led you here, from whom you can take a set of Akaviri Orders. At the other end of the tunnels, you need only follow the winding path north to reach the ruins. There are likely to be a lot of Pale Pass Ogres.  Pale Pass[edit] RemasteredOblivion The Draconian Madstone The Draconian Madstone Once at the ruins themselves, search within the broken walls for the entrance into the Mouth of the Serpent. The article on Fort Pale Pass provides maps of this fort. Watch yourself inside the fort; it is filled with traps built so well that they work even now. Go from Mouth to Scales (or Eyes) to Fangs to Venom within the fortress. You'll be fighting Undead Akaviri Soldiers as you go, and will likely be hit once or twice by deadly traps, so this place can be a pain (and, annoyingly, the skeletons' Ruined Akaviri Blades are almost worthless). Once you finally enter the Venom of the Serpent, you will see the Akaviri Commander, Mishaxhi. Speak with Mishaxhi to find that he is still waiting for those orders. If you have them (see Serpent's Trail above), you can send him away by handing him the tablet. If you don't have the tablet, fighting him is also an option. However, if you give him the orders, any remaining Akaviri soldiers will stand down (die), and the fort will be put ""at peace"". The Commander is a ghost, so if you choose to fight him, remember that he is immune to normal weapons.  Return to the Countess[edit] After the Commander is dealt with, enter the room behind him and find the amulet on a pedestal in the back of the room. With amulet in hand, return to Countess Carvain. Your reward for bringing her the amulet is the leveled item Ring of the Vipereye, which fortifies your agility and provides you with a resistance to magic."

Catch sight of Mehrunes Dagon, and wait for your journal to update. Run to the Temple, then watch Martin turn into an avatar of Akatosh and battle Lord Dagon. Ocato names you the Champion of Cyrodiil.","The Circle Closes[edit] High Chancellor Ocato meeting Martin for the first time(Oblivion Remastered) With the Amulet of Kings reclaimed and Martin Septim under safe watch, all that's left to be done is for Martin to relight the Dragonfires in the Temple of the One, resealing the barrier between Tamriel and Oblivion. However, there is still a matter of regal tradition: Martin wants the Elder Council's blessing to be accepted as Emperor without officially being an heir. For one final task, you must escort him to the Imperial Palace to complete the ceremony and end this ordeal at last. Upon arrival, High Chancellor Ocato greets Martin amiably and is about to officially accept him as Emperor when an exhausted and terrified messenger rushes in reporting Oblivion Gates opening inside the Imperial City's walls! The Jaws of Oblivion[edit] The Daedra and Mythic Dawn have launched a last-ditch effort to achieve victory over the Empire. They have stormed the Imperial City and opened a multitude of Oblivion Gates. No sooner than the messenger stops speaking do Daedra burst through the doors to the council chamber and attack everyone within. With the help of the Palace Guards, the Blades, and Ocato, they can be defeated quickly, though this is only the start of the epic battle. If Baurus and Jauffre survived the previous battles, they will aid you in this darkest hour as well. If Baurus is dead, Captain Steffan will take his place. You would be wise to save the game before you exit the palace, and make any preparations you feel are necessary (repairing weapons and/or armor, making a few potions, healing your allies, etc.) Be warned that Martin is no longer marked as essential, and further, the game is over if he dies. Because he is only wearing the low-defense Emperor Robes, he will make easy prey indeed. It is up to you to protect him. Prior to entering the Imperial City, you could even reverse pick pocket onto him a zero weight mage's hood enchanted with fire-shield which he will don. Once you have exited the palace, you will be swarmed by a battalion of Daedra that will likely exhaust some of the help you receive from your companions. It is advisable to stay by Martin at all times, helping him kill whatever Daedra he attacks. If you can, use healing spells on him to keep his health up. If you do not have any, simply quickly killing Daedra will minimize the damage dealt to Martin and help him to survive. After the Daedra in Green Emperor Way have been dealt with, take a moment to rest and resupply yourself. Repair any broken equipment if you can, and take anything you may need from the bodies of the dead to replace whatever resources you may have used. When you are ready, lead the troops through the door to the Temple District. More Oblivion Gates open, spewing forth more Daedra. Instead of trying to attack them, rush to the right to be greeted by the sight of a group of guards fighting futilely against a massive, red-skinned, four-armed, demonic creature wearing a spiked gauntlet and wielding an axe... Mehrunes Dagon himself! The Last Stand[edit] RemasteredOblivion The Avatar of Akatosh The Avatar of Akatosh The plan has failed. The barriers between Tamriel and Oblivion have already dissolved - lighting the Dragonfires will do nothing now. As soon as you get the quest update, run back outside the gate and meet Martin. In desperation, he tries rapidly to think of a solution. Mehrunes Dagon, as he explains, is an immortal, and can only be killed by another immortal. No matter how many Guards throw themselves at him, Dagon will never fall. However, from this, and your suggestion about using the Amulet of Kings, he forms a backup plan. He decides that all hope may not be lost, and that Dagon can be defeated - but Martin needs to get inside the Temple first. With both an Oblivion Gate and Dagon blocking the way inside, the only way there is past the Daedric Prince himself. If you can just get Martin inside, he will handle the rest. There are a variety of ways to get past Dagon. Although you can't harm Dagon by normal means, you can ""stagger"" him, if you do enough damage in a single attack. The critical amount of damage is set to be one-half of your health (or 50 points if your health is less than 100). If a single attack does more damage than this, then Dagon will stagger backward and be unable to attack for roughly ten seconds, giving you an opportunity to run past. Another option is to count on luck: if Dagon is preoccupied by crushing the Imperial Guards beneath his heel, he may not notice if you simply run past him. Fortifying your Speed will help with this approach. You could also run behind the nearby building, following the outer walls of the district, and slip behind Dagon without him ever seeing you. You may also use an Invisibility spell or Sneak and Chameleon to easily slip past him. The key is to get to the Temple door quickly. Martin will follow, if you get there before your allies are overwhelmed and he is mired in battle. The Avatar strikes Dagon(Oblivion Remastered) Whichever option you choose, run inside the Temple with Martin in tow. When he enters, he appears almost relieved, and hurriedly explains his plan: the Amulet of Kings is infused with the Dragon God Akatosh's blood, and as Martin is a part of the Dragonblood, he may be able to use his joined blood, the Amulet, and the power of Akatosh's Temple to summon the power of the Dragon himself. He bids you farewell, gasps a thanks to you for all that you've done, and rushes atop the altar as Dagon smashes through the rooftop. Staring down upon the last Septim, Dagon menaces him, but Martin stands unafraid. Suddenly, beams of light burst forth from Martin as he shatters the Amulet of Kings and transforms into a gigantic, flaming dragon. Dagon and Martin - now the Avatar of Akatosh - clash, the two immortals battling for the fate of Nirn. Finally, Martin swoops down and buries his jaws into Dagon's neck, wounding him, and finishes him off with a breath of holy fire. Dagon falls, his physical form banished and the Oblivion Gates closed. Martin, however, pays the ultimate price for borrowing the power of Akatosh: he turns to stone atop the Temple Altar, an eternal monument to him and his bravery."

She wants you to find and kill a High Elf named Faelian, somewhere in the Imperial City. She suggests speaking to your fellow Brothers and Sisters for advice. She also warns you not to arouse suspicions with Adamus Phillida, an Imperial Guard Captain and sworn enemy of the Brotherhood and says you must do this killing in a secure indoor location with no witnesses to receive your bonus. Tiber Septim Hotel[edit] Vicente Valtieri will reveal that the Elves of the Imperial City are a rather close-knit community and that at least one of them will know Faelian, so travel to the Imperial City and speak with any Elf with a disposition of 50 or more about Faelian to learn that he lives at the Tiber Septim Hotel, in the Talos Plaza District. Speak with Augusta Calidia at the Tiber Septim to learn that Faelian was once a wealthy nobleman, but he's squandered his fortune on skooma. His wealthy girlfriend Atraena lives at the hotel as well and he visits her at night; perhaps she has more information. If you run into Faelian inside the hotel and speak with him, he will think that you are a fellow addict and will ask you to meet him later, outside the hotel. The hotel is a very public place; killing Faelian inside the hotel means you won't get your bonus for the contract. Dealing with Faelian[edit] Method 1[edit] If Atraena's disposition is above 50, she will tell you that Faelian visits Lorkmir's house in the Elven Gardens District during the day to enjoy his skooma because the house is abandoned. In fact, he heads for the house at 11am and stays there until 5pm. Go to the house during that time, pick the lock, or steal the key from Faelian, and kill him in any way you see fit. If you search the basement you'll find Lorkmir's dead body, apparently killed by Faelian, which explains why the house is abandoned. Method 2[edit] Nordinor dealing skooma in Bravil Talk to Faelian outside of the hotel and you'll quickly see that he is under the influence of skooma. After listening to his rantings ask him about skooma and he will get even more excited. If you happen to have some already you can offer it to him then and there. Otherwise, he will tell you about his supplier, Nordinor in Bravil; other places where skooma can be obtained are listed on the skooma article. Any source of skooma will be acceptable to Faelian. It is also possible to pickpocket it from Faelian himself, as he doesn't care. Once you have obtained one bottle of skooma, return to Faelian. In return for the skooma he'll give you the key to Lorkmir's house. Use the key to get in, wait for Faelian to arrive and kill him. Payoff[edit] Either way, return to Ocheeva for a level dependent gold reward (up to 600 gold) and a single Infamy point. If you were not detected, you will receive Shadowhunt as a bonus: a leveled bow with Damage Health and Damage Magicka enchantments. If you failed to properly complete the Assassinated Man quest, Ocheeva will now promote you to the rank of Eliminator and give you the Sanctuary Well Key."

You will have to get into Skingrad dungeon to talk to him. Visit the Prisoner[edit] Upon traveling to Castle Skingrad and locating the dungeon it becomes obvious that talking to Theranis won't be a simple task. The door to the cells in the dungeon is locked and the guard posted outside cannot be bribed to gain access. Raising the guard's disposition to get him to accept the bribe will not work. However, raising his disposition may help you later in the quest. Talking to the guard will allow you to glean the information that Castle Skingrad's butler, Shum gro-Yarug, is looking to hire staff. You now have several avenues available to gain access to the prisoner's cells: Live on the Wages of a Slop-Drudge: This is the method suggested by the quest. After gaining the tip from the guard that the butler at Castle Skingrad is looking to hire staff, track him down and speak to him. The butler, Shum gro-Yarug, is normally located in the Skingrad County Main Hall, however asking around at the castle will reveal he has a daily schedule he sticks to - he travels to the West Weald Inn at 10am and then to the Colovian Traders at noon.Once you speak to him about gaining a job at the castle, he will tell you his need to hire a new 'slop drudge' to feed the prisoners. The pay is terrible, and he is genuinely surprised when you choose to accept the job. Shum will indicate that you can choose to feed the prisoners at any time of the day, and that the guard in the dungeon will open the main door for you. Return to the dungeon and speak to the guard, using the new dialogue option indicating you are the new slop drudge. The guard will grumble about having to open the door - wishing they would just give you a key - but will oblige, granting you access to the cells. Break into Jail: Sneak or use magic to break into the dungeon. You can also pickpocket the key from the dungeon guard (particularly easy if you follow the off-duty guard to his barracks and pickpocket him there). If you fail, however, this method can backfire, for example by causing a fight that injures your cell mate. Charm the Jail Guard: You can raise the disposition of the jail guard as high as possible, using some of the tips provided at the article on Disposition. Work quickly, as the door will eventually re-lock itself. Trojan Thief: Get arrested and choose the go to jail option. To intentionally get arrested, steal a cheap item from a guard. You should stow away your items in a safe place before attempting this method—just remember to keep a lockpick with you. Alternate Route: You can get into the jail cells using the secret back entrance. Enter the castle via the main hall. Pick the lock on the door to the dining hall area at the top of the main balcony in the alcove next to the long stairs that lead up to the Lord's Chambers. Go down into the basement through the pantry to the left (first door on the right). At the end of the Wine Cellar hallway, next to a small bedroom, activate the unlit candle on the right to expose the secret tunnel to the prison. Inside Man[edit] Once you've gained access to the prisoner's cells, it quickly becomes obvious that Theranis is nowhere to be seen. Only one prisoner is currently a guest of the dungeon, Larthjar the Laggard, a Nord hailing from Imperial City. Speak to Larthjar and you discover that a ""Pale Lady"" takes prisoners from their cells regularly, and when they've been taken for a third time they don't return. It seems Theranis has made his third journey with her days ago and she has now taken his Argonian cellmate. Larthjar indicates that the Argonian put up a struggle and he was bleeding when he was taken. Looking around the other cells you will notice that there is a trail of blood leading to a blank wall. A macabre 'trail of breadcrumbs'... The Trail of Blood[edit] The trail of blood ends at the wall at the end of the passageway between the prisoner's cell. Looking around the wall you will notice that the sconce to the right of the wall marked as a ""Strange Candle"" can be activated - opening a secret passage. Following the trail of blood through a roughly hewn tunnel will lead you to another wall, this time with a lever on the left. Activating the lever opens the wall, leading back into the halls of Castle Skingrad. The trail of blood continues to the Skingrad wine cellar (the very one Shum gro-Yarug said he better not catch you in if you took the slop drudge job). The trail ends at a large wine cask - but logic dictates finding a switch to open yet another secret door. Looking around the other wine cask to the right where blood is also present will allow you to find an unlit 'strange candle' switch - activate this to open the wine cask. The Pale Lady[edit] Following another short hewn passageway will lead you to the hidden chamber with the Pale Lady holding audience in her feeding room. The Pale Lady will attack you on sight, so take her down quickly and watch out as you can contract porphyric hemophilia from her. This is one of the few cases where you are allowed to kill someone while on a Thieves Guild quest; you do not receive any blood price penalty for killing the Pale Lady. Once the Pale Lady is dead, you can survey the surroundings and will notice the body of Theranis on the floor and an Argonian in a cell. Looting Theranis' body will activate a quest message - but the book he had stolen is not on his corpse. Upon speaking to the Argonian prisoner you will discover it is your old acquaintance Amusei! He shares with you his current 'adventures' and indicates that Theranis told him where he hid his 'special treasure'. Amusei will agree to tell you where Theranis hid his treasure - which you assume to be the book - if you help him escape. Alternatively, you could sneak behind the Pale Lady, pickpocket the key from her and free Amusei, assuming your Sneak skill is high enough. You will want to have an Invisibility or Chameleon on target or on touch spell in your inventory for the following to work or simply sneak/run very quickly with Amusei in tow (The Pale Lady does not appear to follow very far). If you go the route of Invisibility/Chameleon, use your spell of choice on Amusei and yourself and you will be able to escape from the dungeon without bloodshed. If Amusei seems to get lost, don't worry. Just keep going to the objective marker and he'll reappear upon entering a new cell (when you see the loading screen). Get Amusei to Freedom[edit] Open the portcullis on Amusei's cell using the key from the Pale Lady and he will start following you. You have to get out of Castle Skingrad without being detected (sneaking), so check the time of day before starting out - it is best to attempt to escape at around 2am, when all of the castle's inhabitants are asleep. Use the secret passage back to the wine cellar. Now you can go back the same way you came, sneaking past the dungeon guard, maybe also using Chameleon (this is the easiest way as you have only one NPC to sneak past). If the guard catches you and your personality is 100 and the guard's disposition is already maxed, he will let you go with a warning. Again, if you have the Paralyze spell, you could tell Amusei to wait, Paralyze the guard, then retrieve Amusei and sneak past and exit to the courtyard, which will prevent the guard from shouting out that prisoners are escaping. Or you use the longer way: turn right as you arrive the wine cellar and exit using the door to the Castle proper which leads to the Dining Hall area. There may be people in the Dining Hall when trying to escape with Amusei, although this can be avoided by waiting until nightfall. Sneak by—using Invisibility/Chameleon as required depending on your sneak ability—when they are sitting at the table with their backs to the door, or you will get a 500 gold bounty. If you don't commit any crimes (like killing guards), however, this bounty will be removed when you get to the safe point outside the castle and have met with Amusei (if he was not with you at the time). Proceed through the dining area to the door on the right. This hall leads to another door leading back to the courtyard area. If Amusei tends to run around to another door after you've gone through a locked door en route, try reverse pickpocketing the Skingrad Castle Key onto him. While you will then have to pick door locks, at least he will follow you rather than running a different route in front of a guard. Leave the castle grounds via the main gate and cross the bridge leading back to the path to Skingrad. The guard that is normally present at the archway to the bridge should be absent. Make sure you follow the actual path down the hillside towards town - don't shortcut down the hillside to the left as the quest flag may not update. If you have decent armor and endurance, you can use another, fairly easy route. Simply run past everyone, and when the guards try to stop you use the resist arrest option. The guards will attack you, but not Amusei. Do not attack the guards or kill them, as that will put an even larger bounty on your head. Keep running until you get to the courtyard, then tell Amusei to ""wait here."" Yield to the guards, and either pay the fine or go to jail. If you go to jail it is not advised to break out, because then you just have another bounty on your head. When you leave jail or finish paying the fine, Amusei will either be with you, or will be where you left him. Talk to him and tell him to follow you, then leave the castle. Once you have received a quest update message indicating you and Amusei have successfully escaped, talk to Amusei and he will tell you that the 'treasure' is located ""under the bush near the well, behind Nerastarel's house"". He will also admit he was going to retrieve it himself, but he owes you for bailing him out. It seems he is going to try his hand again at entering the Thieves Guild. The Book Regained[edit] Locate Nerastarel's house in Skingrad, it is directly across from Hammer and Tongs. Retrieve the book from behind the bush at the rear of the house, near the well as per Amusei's instructions. Return to S'Krivva with the book for a reward of 400 gold."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:A_Mage%27s_Staff","Speak with Raminus Polus about the Arcane University. Once accepted, your task is to have a personal Staff made. Travel to Wellspring Cave only to discover there is a problem with the mages who guard this sacred place. Make your way through the cave, taking care of (or avoiding) any enemies you encounter. On the farside of Wellspring Cave dispose of the necromancers lying in wait. Take the wood from the chest and return to Raminus, who instructs you to go see Delmar in the Chironasium. Delmar asks you to choose the type of enchantment you would like and requests a full day's time to finish the work. Return after a day has passed and Delmar will tell you to retrieve your custom staff from the cupboard in the back. After you have your staff go see Raminus to be promoted to Journeyman.","Wellspring Cave[edit] After you have received all recommendations, travel to the Arcane University and speak to Raminus Polus. He will be in the Arch-Mage's Lobby during the daytime. At night, he will be unavailable to you. Once you are accepted into the guild by Raminus, speak to him about tasks to be told about the construction of your Mage's Staff. First you need to retrieve some special wood for the staff from Wellspring Cave, east of the Imperial City. Darkness on the Horizon[edit] Once you enter Wellspring Cave the quest log will direct you to speak with Eletta or Zahrasha. It isn't long before you encounter a slight hitch in this plan: Zahrasha has been killed by a necromancer just inside the entrance. Take the Wellspring Cave Key from Zahrasha's body, and continue on to discover what has happened here. More necromancers lie further in, so take care of them as you go. Exit from the other end of the cave using the key (the lock cannot be picked). You will emerge onto an island in the middle of Lake Rumare, just in time to see Eletta getting killed. You will then be approached by Noveni Othran who wants a word with you before she tries to kill you. She'll be assisted by two other necromancers. All three must be disposed of in order to advance the quest. If you are having difficulty defeating them, there are a number of strategies you can employ: If you have a high enough Acrobatics skill, one easy way to dispatch them is simply to jump off the cliffs to your left.  One by one, the necromancers will jump after you... to their deaths. However, after you jump off the cliffs, the only way to get back to the center of the island is through Wellspring Cave (the island is surrounded by invisible one-way walls which can be penetrated on the southwest corner of the island, between two large rocks. After you have your chat with Noveni Othran the invisible barrier is removed). Turn around and re-enter the cave. Only one of them will follow you. Kill them one at a time by exiting and re-entering the cave.  Individually they are relatively easy to kill. Re-enter the cave and dive underwater. Simply swim if you are an Argonian, otherwise use the Buoyancy spell (or any other spell that allows you to breathe underwater) while your enemies drown. Imperial soldiers on horseback often patrol the road outside the cave entrance, from just south at Fort Magia, north up the hill to Fort Urasek. If you exit the cave with necromancer(s) following you, make a quick run to the soldiers who will dispose of them for you. Completing Your Staff[edit] Once all necromancers have been defeated, check Eletta's body and then recover the wood for your staff which is in the Stone Chest at the center of the island. Return to Raminus and tell him what has happened. Raminus will direct you to find and speak to Delmar in the Chironasium to continue your staff creation. Your dialogue with him will determine the exact staff you end up with. You do not have to wait 24 hours to get your staff, just until the next day comes to receive your finished staff which will be in the cupboard in the back of the room. It may also contain 5 Apprentice-level scrolls, which may also be Spell Tomes if you have the DLC installed.  Afterwards, return to Raminus to be promoted to Journeyman and receive a new task."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Mages_Guild_Second_Suspension","After breaking a rule of the Mages Guild, you are told to talk to Raminus Polus. Collect alchemy samples and hand them over to regain your standing.","Commit The Crime[edit] Upon joining the guild you are presented with a copy of the Mages Guild Charter, which states that any crime committed against a guild member results in suspension. Unlike in the Thieves Guild, however, assault is not counted as a crime and only theft and murder will cause a suspension. It seems that it was intended to include assault as a punishable crime but the necessary scripts are commented out. Theft is only treated as an offense if it is detected but murder is always counted, even if you have 100% Chameleon in effect at the time. As soon as the offense is committed, the Mages Guild Key is removed from your inventory and you are moved outside if the offense was committed on guild property. At this point, guild members will often start to direct you to Raminus Polus. Raminus will give you a small lecture about how disappointed he is and then offer a chance for redemption. First Offense[edit] If your crime was a theft, you need to acquire 20 Dragon's Tongues and 20 Redwort Flowers.  For murder, you need to acquire 20 Vampire Dusts and 20 Daedra Hearts.  On your first offense, there is actually a glitch that allows you to collect 20 of just one of the two required items, although you will lose whatever you have collected so far of the second required item.  Once you have collected enough, return to Raminus Polus to turn in your ingredients and be reinstated. Full details on where to find each of the ingredients are provided on the individual ingredient pages.  The following list provides only a couple possible suggestions. Dragon's Tongues 21 plants are near the entrance to Fort Redwater. Enough flowers are scattered south of Bravil to cover the 20 needed. Look along the path and on the north shore of the inlet to the Lower Niben. 6 plants are on the shore of a swamp that is located just above the 'd' in 'Blackwood' on the map. 14 plants can be found just southwest of the entrance to Fort Irony. 4 plants can be found by the top of the 'L' in Leyawiin. Redwort Flowers Alchemy stores may randomly stock them, but you will probably have to wait for enough to spawn. 21 plants are on the shore of a swamp that is located just above the 'd' in 'Blackwood' on the map (these are easiest to find if you have installed the Knights of the Nine official download; then there are 25 at the entrance to Fort Bulwark). There are also 11 Dragon's Tongue plants here. You can find 5 more plants southeast of Leyawiin's North East gate, just off where the path curves, or straight in the direction from the gate to Fort Blueblood Daedra Hearts Starting at level 12, alchemy stores may randomly stock them, but you will probably have to wait for enough to spawn. Dremora are easiest to find before you have completed the Main Quest, or just check near or inside any Oblivion Gates. Brittlerock Cave and Conjurer Dungeons are other locations where hearts may be acquired. Vampire Dust Raminus will only accept standard Vampire Dust, not the quest-specific Vampire Dust found on Bloodcrust Vampires.  The Unofficial Oblivion Patch allows Raminus to accept Bloodcrust Vampire dust. Never sold in alchemy stores. Vampires can be found in various Vampire Dungeons. If you were Arch-Mage when you were expelled from the guild, you can still use the Enchanted Chest to duplicate ingredients.  One catch is that you will officially be trespassing to get to the Arch-Mage's Quarters - even though there is never anybody upstairs in the tower to catch you, it does mean that you cannot wait upstairs to pass the time.  Another catch is that the ten duplicated versions of the ingredients will be considered stolen items, but Raminus will accept stolen ingredients just as readily as legally obtained ones. Second Offense[edit] After your second offense the procedure is nearly identical to the first offense.  You are again sent to collect 20 Dragon's Tongues and 20 Redwort Flowers if you committed theft, or 20 Daedra Hearts and 20 Vampire Dusts for murder.  The only difference is that this time around you must have 20 of both requested ingredients. Third Offense[edit] After your third offense, you are permanently expelled from the Mages Guild. The most serious implications are that you will no longer be able to access the Enchanting and Spellmaking altars and be permanently denied the services of Boderi Farano (Advanced Mysticism Trainer), Martina Floria (Master Illusion Trainer), Gaspar Stegine and Borissean (Spell Merchants): they are all residents of the Arcane University, which will be forever closed to you. If you are Arch-Mage it is impossible to get permanently expelled; you just receive a normal bounty for any offenses that you commit."

The location of this Shrine can be marked on your map by: Speaking to Thaurron in the Anvil Mages Guild Speaking to Pinarus Inventius in Anvil about Daedric Shrines (you must have already read Modern Heretics or have spoken with Ulene Hlervu about ""Cheydinhal"") An Offering to the God[edit] Speak to Shobob gro-Rugdush, who (unless you are playing an Orc) will mention that the followers don't like 'beautiful people' and suggests that maybe you can convince him you're not so beautiful on the inside. With a little more disposition (50) he'll tell you that they don't like non-Orcs and that you should approach the shrine at your own risk.  If you are playing as an Orc, Shobob will be more welcoming and no disposition boosts are needed. In either case, you will need Troll Fat to activate Malacath's shrine. Once you have the troll fat, activate the shrine. If you are an Orc, Malacath will say: Nice present! Good! And from a nice Orc, too! Double good! Orcs are smart.

If you go against slavery, speak to Lady Drad to learn this information. You may need to raise her disposition to 70 to get this information from her. Exact locations to Bleak Mine are not given, but it is east of the estate. The key for unlocking Bleak Mine can be found in the sitting room area on the ground floor. The mine is protected by a leveled lock. You can pick it, use an Open spell, or use the key found in the Estate. Once in the mine, your objective is to find the ogres and release them from their cells.  There are two groups of ogres, both in locked cells.  Each cage is opened by a different key. Each Dunmer guard carries at least one of the two keys. (If you're choosing the non-violent approach, you can pickpocket one of the guards if your sneak skill is good enough), or you can open them yourself.  Once freed, the ogres will help you kill any guards they encounter. If you have kept your weapon sheathed so far, the guards will attack the ogres but not you.

Speak with Alawen at Troll Candle Camp to find that she requires you to possess an elven bow before she will train you. Only an unenchanted elven bow will do, even though glass, ebony, and Daedric are better quality. Alawen will not take the bow, she just wants to make sure you're using ""good equipment"", which is quite ironic, considering she herself uses a silver bow. Elven bows may be found on Bandit bowmen, Marauder archers and Skeletons at level 9. They can also be found randomly in the Legion Commanders Chest in the Imperial Legion Offices between levels 9 and 11. Goblin Warlords may also carry elven bows (25% chance). At level 13, elven bows may be available from vendors. This is the only quest in the entire game other than the Daedric quests that has a ""level requirement"", though it is not exactly the level that is required, as Elven bows are not available in-game anywhere before level 9. While it is possible to ""complete"" the quest by failing it, if Alawen should die after the quest has been obtained, it is impossible, without glitches, to receive her training without reaching the required level.

Return to Modryn Oreyn for your reward.","Viranus Donton[edit] When you reach the rank of Protector, you will be directed to Modryn Oreyn in Chorrol for further duties. Your job is to take Viranus Donton—the son of the Guildmaster—on a contract to boost his confidence, without his mother knowing about it. The contract itself is to locate Galtus Previa, who has gone missing in Nonwyll Cavern, northwest of Chorrol. To find Viranus, cross the street from the Fighters Guild to the Donton house. Viranus will probably be right inside or upstairs in a sitting area. Fill him in about the contract and dissuade him from talking to his mother first, at which point he will become a follower. Nonwyll Cavern[edit] With Viranus in tow, travel to Nonwyll Cavern. It is located a short walk up into the hills north of Chorrol's north gate and is populated by an mixture of ""savage"" Monsters: ogres, minotaurs, and trolls. These versions are weaker than the standard version at player levels below 19, 12, and 7 respectively, after which they will be tougher (though Savage Trolls will never possess health regeneration). If you enter through the main entrance, you will need to pass through the first zone - Nonwyll Cavern - before reaching the second zone - Nonwyll Chamber of the Titans - which is where Galtus can be found (see the place page for more info). There is also a secondary entrance (map) which leads directly to the second zone and allows you to avoid three Savage Trolls in the first zone and up to two further enemies in the second. To find it, keep climbing the mountain trail after you reach the main entrance and press on north past a western fork, which leads to Cloud Top. Once you arrive at a wooden bridge turn southwest and continue downhill for a short while until you reach the entrance. Either way, be prepared for a series of tough fights, though Viranus will help out and distract some of the enemies. As he is marked as Essential, he cannot actually die, despite Modryn's worry that he might not ""come back in one piece"". Galtus Previa's body can be found in the northernmost chamber, alongside a Broken Shield which you should pick up and return to Modryn to unlock some additional dialogue lines. Reward[edit] Return to the Fighters Guild in Chorrol and report to Modryn Oreyn. If you picked up the shield and then hand it over while reporting in, he will ominously remark that he recognizes it, but refuses to elaborate further.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:A_Matter_of_Honor","Receive the contract. Find Alval Uvani and decide how you will deal with him. Make your way to the next drop.","The Target[edit] This dead drop is in a coffin located just right of the entrance to Fort Redman, north of Leyawiin. Don't forget to acquire the schedule of Alval Uvani. The Dunmer merchant, a powerful user of Destruction magic, travels from city to city in Cyrodiil, stopping to sleep at inns and his rented house in the southeast corner of Leyawiin. The cities he visits are: Bravil, at The Lonely Suitor Lodge on the night of Morndas to Tirdas. Skingrad, at the West Weald Inn on the night of Middas to Turdas. Bruma, at Olav's Tap and Tack on the night of Fredas to Loredas. And finally he should visit his house in Leyawiin on Sundas. Keep in mind that his travels obviously take time, so he might not be at location you'd expect him at the right time. A more detailed schedule can be found on his NPC page. Alval is a strong mage, but he has a rare allergy to honey, a key ingredient in mead. If you follow him to a bar and put some mead in front of him, he is likely to take a sip. This will paralyze him, allowing for an easier kill. You can also achieve the same effect by buying the bar's supply of food and drink and then selling the proprietor some mead, or by breaking into his house in Leyawiin and replacing all the food inside with mead. Alternatively, as he is often found traveling the roads, you can simply kill him in the wilderness."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:May_the_Best_Thief_Win","Meet with Armand Christophe at midnight. Beat your competitors to Amantius Allectus' diary. Return the stolen diary to Armand.","Once you have learned about the existence of the Thieves Guild, travel to the Garden of Dareloth and wait until midnight. You will discover that three people have arrived in the garden. One is Armand Christophe, local Thieves Guild doyen, the other two are your fellow guild candidates, Amusei, an Argonian, and Methredhel, a Bosmer. The Race for the Diary[edit] Armand will inform you that in order to join the Thieves Guild, a simple competition will be conducted. You are to steal a diary from Amantius Allectus, and the first thief to retrieve the diary and return it to him will be inducted into the Guild. Armand will only indicate that Amantius is located somewhere in the Imperial City, but that the local beggars might be able to tell you where his house is located. Amusei may loudly say that Amantius may live in the Elven Gardens District, but this is not true, so do not listen to him. Plan of Attack[edit] Once you have commenced the quest, Methredhel will begin to run towards the Imperial City – she appears to already know the target's location. You can opt to follow her, however she is quite fast and depending on your current level and speed you may lose her quickly. By asking any of the Imperial City beggars (after a five-coin bribe), you will gain the information that Amantius lives in the far east side of the Temple District. The easiest beggar to query is Puny Ancus who is conveniently located just outside the Garden of Dareloth, directly behind Methredhel's shack. If his disposition toward you is high enough, he will tell you for free. Amantius' diary details a grim experiment With the location of Amantius' house confirmed, make your way to the Imperial City Temple District and enter the house. You will generally find Methredhel already inside and sneaking around looking for the diary. As long as you head straight for the desk containing the diary quickly you should be able to obtain the diary before she does. Creative Thieving[edit] If you enter Amantius' house and Methredhel has beaten you and removed the diary already, you will be informed of this by a quest message. You will also be given a tip via the message that you will be able to steal the diary back from Methredhel (because neither you nor Methredhel is a member of the Guild yet, it's not considered a violation of Guild rules). Methredhel will return to her shack in the Waterfront District and place the diary in a locked chest - where you can steal it while she sleeps. You may encounter Adanrel or Carwen awake inside which makes sneaking open her chest somewhat more difficult. You can choose to wait until the early evening, around 6pm, before attempting to steal the diary as Methredhel will be away from her shack for dinner. After 12-36 hours (a noon and then a midnight has passed since the diary was placed in the chest), she will retrieve the diary to deliver it to Armand. Alternatively, you can simply pick-pocket the diary from Methredhel on her way back home. Welcome to the Thieves Guild[edit] Return the diary at midnight to Armand in the Garden of Dareloth, and you'll have officially joined the Thieves Guild! If you complete the quest by giving Armand the diary, you will receive 1 Infamy point. A Second Fighting Chance[edit] If you do not manage to retrieve the diary and return it to Armand, you still have a chance at entering the Thieves Guild via a second thieving mission. Armand will instruct you to steal a sword from the shop A Fighting Chance, located in the Market District. Armand tells you that ""Amusei is a bungler and won't get this offer,"" so there is no need to worry about competition this time around. Make sure you have lockpicks because you will need to break in some doors. The sword, Rohssan's Antique Cutlass, is located in a chest on the second floor of Rohssan's shop in her private quarters. Rohssan's unnamed dog is located in her private quarters, guarding the chest, so you will need to either: Use your sneak or illusion skills to retrieve the sword without alerting the dog. Kill the dog and retrieve the sword. Use a Calm or Command Creature spell to pacify the dog after you steal the sword. If you are attempting the theft at night, Rohssan is sleeping in her private quarters, so a sneak attack on the dog is best to prevent it from alerting her to your presence. Breaking into her quarters during the day while Rohssan is tending the shop is also an option, just ensure that you are successfully sneaking on the stairs when you pick the lock. Return to Armand with the sword to become a member of the Thieves Guild and receive 2 Infamy points."

He tells you about Weebam-Na. Find Weebam-Na, and take him to Mazoga. She will want him to take her to Fisherman's Rock; Weebam-Na will respond, and promptly retreat. Take Mazoga to Fisherman's Rock, and she'll confront Mogens Wind-Shifter. You should aid her in the battle to keep her from dying. After the skirmish, she tells you of her becoming a knight and her experiences. You are free to loot the gang members' corpses. Return to the Count, and he'll give you the opportunity to become a Knight-Errant of the White Stallion.","Mysterious Knight[edit] There's talk in town of an Orc named Mazoga who claims to be a knight. You can find her in the Leyawiin Castle County Hall, but she won't tell you much until after you've spoken with Count Marius Caro. Speak to the Count about ""Service to Leyawiin"" and he will ask you to find out what Mazoga wants. Speak to Mazoga, (who demands that you call her 'Sir', even though she is a woman) who wants you to find a local hunter named Weebam-Na, and bring him to her. Report your findings to the Count and he'll ask you to find Weebam-Na. He tells you Weebam-Na is a well known hunter who has a house in town. Find Weebam-Na. He won't want to cooperate at first, but after a little persuasion he'll be curious to go see what this is about. Mazoga demands that Weebam-Na take her to Fisherman's Rock but she won't divulge why, so he refuses to take her, although he will give directions. If you talk to Weebam-Na after this, he will say, ""Good luck with Mazoga,"" and makes a hasty retreat. Mazoga the Orc and Mogens Wind-Shifter have a nice chat Fisherman's Rock[edit] Talk to Mazoga again and she'll demand that you take her to Fisherman's Rock. She says Mogens Wind-Shifter has a camp there and she needs to talk to him. She also says that she doesn't want any head-bashing before she finishes talking, a clue that there will eventually be some head-bashing. Fisherman's Rock is a short run north of town on the eastern river bank. When you arrive there with Mazoga, she'll start to talk to Mogens and accuse him of murdering her friend, Ra'vindra. She then starts a fight and she'll need help with Mogens' gang of four (Mogens, J'Baasha, Mensa Selas, and Ayisha), who will attack you as well. Reward[edit] After the battle, Mazoga tells you the story of how her best friend was murdered by Mogens and his gang after Ra'vindra told the city guard about them. Mazoga then became a self-appointed knight and swore an oath of vengeance. She says you can keep all the bandits' gear, suggests perhaps you should become a knight yourself, and then heads back to Castle Leyawiin. Report to the Count to receive his gratitude. As a reward, he offers you an opportunity to become a Knight-Errant of the White Stallion. This then leads to the Knights of the White Stallion quest."

Plant evidence suggesting the deaths were the product of house warring. Return to the shrine for your reward of the Ebony Blade.","Locating the Shrine of Mephala[edit] Mephala's Shrine is located in the Great Forest, east of the Silver Road, halfway between where it meets the Orange and Red Ring Roads. The location of this Shrine can be marked on your map by: Speaking to Ontus Vanin about ""Daedric shrines""; you must have already read Modern Heretics or have spoken with Ulene Hlervu about ""Cheydinhal"". Speaking to Luther Broad about ""Imperial City""; you must raise disposition to 60. An Offering to the God[edit] You need to be at least level 15 to start this quest. Talk to the Dunmer there, Dredena Hlavel. Request an audience and she will tell you to make an offering of nightshade between midnight and dawn; places where it can be found are detailed on the Nightshade article. Once you have some nightshade, activate the shrine. Mephala wants you to go to Bleaker's Way and kill the leaders of the two prominent families there. Her exact dialogue is: Call me 'Webspinner'. Pluck but a single thread, and the weave unravels. In Bleaker's Way, two families, Nord and Dunmer, live in perfect harmony. But beneath the surface lurks the secret seed of strife. Kill the leaders of the two families. Plant evidence to implicate the other family as the killer. And don't get caught. Be cunning. Don't spoil my scheme. And don't die... that would spoil everything. Ha-ha-ha-hah! The leaders are Hrol Ulfgar and Nivan Dalvilu.  After killing them you are supposed to plant evidence making it look like the other family was responsible for the murder. Dalvilu vs Ulfgar - the fight begins The Task at Hand[edit] When you first get to Bleaker's Way, you need to find the fake evidence.  Inside Nivan Dalvilu's house you will find a Dalvilu Cermonial Dagger [sic], located on a low table to the right of the entrance; this dagger should be planted on Hrol Ulfgar's body after you've killed him.  In Hrol Ulfgar's house you will find the Ulfgar Family Ring, located next to a Guide to Leyawiin on a table near the base of the attic stairs; the ring should be planted on Nivan Dalvilu's body also after you've killed him. Wait in their houses until they come home, and kill them. Plant the evidence listed above. Before returning to Mephala's shrine, talk to any of the Dalvilu or Ulfgar family members about Hrol Ulfgar or Nivan Dalvilu to plant the seeds of animosity.  Once that is done, the families will openly attack each other until one of the families has been destroyed. Return to the shrine to receive the Ebony Blade, a one-handed blade with Silence and Absorb Health enchantments. Mephala will congratulate you: Well done, little webspinner. Is there a prettier sight than friends at war? Take pleasure in the strife you have caused, mortal.

Once the necromancers are dealt with, return to the shrine to be rewarded with the Ring of Khajiiti.","Locating the Shrine of Meridia[edit] Chart a course west-northwest from Skingrad's west gate to find Meridia's Shrine between Cursed Mine and Shardrock farm. You must be at least level 10 to start this quest. Talk to Basil Ernarde at the shrine to begin. An Offering to the God[edit] Meridia, Lady of Infinite Energies, is associated with the energies of living things, and has a particular dislike of undead creatures. Bring an ingredient from an undead creature (Mort Flesh, Ectoplasm or regular Bonemeal) to the shrine to talk to her. Once presented with the proper offering, Meridia will speak to the player: By the detritus of the profane, I am brought forth. And by your offering, you have made the profane your interest, mortal. The undead are foul, unnatural things. Some of my rivals take pleasure in these abominations. Not Meridia. I wish these creatures destroyed. Hidden behind a door, deep in Howling Cave, are necromancers. They rob graves for the materials to raise their undead armies. Find these necromancers. Destroy them and their abominations. Do this, and earn the gratitude of Meridia. The Task at Hand[edit] Go to Howling Cave, which is east of Castle Skingrad. The necromancers are located directly behind the door at the end of the northern passage, so only enter if prepared for a fight. The necromancers have several potions (due to a bug) and are aided by several leveled undead in addition to their own summoned creatures, all of which can quickly overwhelm you through their sheer numbers if you are not careful. It is recommended to kill the necromancers first to prevent them from summoning additional creatures. Use of enchanted weapons, fire damage poisons, and stealth may also be useful. Command humanoid spells are particularly useful for this quest, and provided you have a good sneak skill, you can avoid taking any damage using them. Returning to the Shrine[edit] Return to the shrine after all five necromancers are dead, and Meridia will applaud your actions: Well done. Those creatures were an affront to all life, and they have paid the price for their actions. Take this ring and go with my blessing. Meridia will reward you with the Ring of Khajiiti, a ring with Fortify Speed (+10) and Chameleon (35%) enchantments."

Near Brindle Home, goad Melus Petilius into attacking and killing you with Molag's Cursed Mace. Be resurrected by Molag Bal and receive the Mace of Molag Bal.","Locating the Shrine of Molag Bal[edit] No one will add the shrine's marker to your map for you. However, it is possible instead to be referred to Olyn Seran, one of the worshippers at the shrine who is also the Master Trainer for Conjuration. If the Conjuration Training quest is active, a quest marker will be placed near the shrine. An Offering to the God[edit] The Redguard, Amir, at the shrine will tell you that you must offer Molag Bal a lion pelt (which can be obtained by slaying a mountain lion). Sometimes, lion pelts will appear in random loot sacks. At level 17 and higher, mountain lions will spawn outdoors in Farm, Plain, Rainforest, Highlands, and Mountain regions (see Outdoors Creature for a map of where these terrains can be found). They will also appear indoors in any caves or ruins occupied by animals; the closest good cave to check is Unmarked Cave.

While he is at the grave, drop the Cursed Mace on the ground between him and the tombstone and attack him (e.g., hit him with a weapon, hand-to-hand or cast an aggressive spell). You must attack him while he is at the grave; it is the only place where he will pick up the mace. Attack him elsewhere and he usually will not respond with aggression, and definitely will not use the mace, even if you have dropped it in front of him. If he is at the grave, he will pick up the mace and attack you. Furthermore, he rarely picks up the mace if you drop it after you attack him; thus it is advisable to place it by him before you strike. Let Melus attack you until you die. It is advisable to save beforehand, however: there is a significant bug that may occur when he kills you. The bug notes provide tips on how to avoid triggering the bug. Returning to the Shrine[edit] At the moment you die (after a loading screen), you will reappear at Molag Bal's shrine. Activate the shrine to receive your reward: the Mace of Molag Bal which absorbs strength and magicka upon strike. Well, it seems you've accomplished the task set out for you. Well done. Another man damned. Another ruined soul. But, you'll still get your prize, won't you? I think it was worth it... don't you? Keep up the good work, little mortal. Should you fail, however, you will get no reward and anger the Daedric Prince. You've failed, mortal. I didn't figure you had it in you. Weakling. Pathetic piece of filth.

You'll be directed to The Lonely Suitor Lodge, where you will quickly find Maglir. Speak to him and he'll reveal he's defected to the Blackwood Company for work, as you will notice from his new armor. How the next part of this quest plays out is affected by the actions you took in Unfinished Business: If you previously covered for Maglir, he'll tell you about Aryarie himself. If you dutifully told Modryn Oreyn the truth about Maglir's first defaulted contract, he'll get quite upset with you, calling you a rat and refusing to speak with you any further. At this stage you can either return to Modryn Oreyn, who will tell you to talk to Aryarie, or speak directly with her in the Bravil Mages Guild for details on completing the contract. Robber's Glen Cave[edit] Aryarie can be found on the main floor of the Guild Hall between 8am and 10pm. She needs ten samples of imp gall for her research and doesn't trust the Blackwood Company to do the job. She suggests Robber's Glen Cave as a likely place to find imps and marks the cave's location on your map. Robber's Glen Cave is one of the few places in the game where imps are always guaranteed to appear. You will find twelve imps in the cave, making it straightforward to fill Aryarie's request. As a monster dungeon, it also has good quality treasure and worth exploring regardless. It is located north of Bravil on the Green Road. However, you do not need to visit Robber's Glen Cave to complete this quest, as any imp gall will suffice. If you already have ten samples in your inventory, you can immediately give them to Aryarie. Alternatively, you can visit any of the other places detailed on the relevant article to obtain the necessary samples. If you are the Mages Guild Arch-Mage and already have a sample, you can use the enchanted chest in the Arch-Mage's quarters to quickly get ten.

Dealing with Faelian[edit] Method 1[edit] If Atraena's disposition is above 50, she will tell you that Faelian visits Lorkmir's house in the Elven Gardens District during the day to enjoy his skooma because the house is abandoned. In fact, he heads for the house at 11am and stays there until 5pm. Go to the house during that time, pick the lock, or steal the key from Faelian, and kill him in any way you see fit. If you search the basement you'll find Lorkmir's dead body, apparently killed by Faelian, which explains why the house is abandoned. Method 2[edit] Nordinor dealing skooma in Bravil Talk to Faelian outside of the hotel and you'll quickly see that he is under the influence of skooma. After listening to his rantings ask him about skooma and he will get even more excited. If you happen to have some already you can offer it to him then and there. Otherwise, he will tell you about his supplier, Nordinor in Bravil; other places where skooma can be obtained are listed on the skooma article. Any source of skooma will be acceptable to Faelian. It is also possible to pickpocket it from Faelian himself, as he doesn't care. Once you have obtained one bottle of skooma, return to Faelian. In return for the skooma he'll give you the key to Lorkmir's house. Use the key to get in, wait for Faelian to arrive and kill him. Payoff[edit] Either way, return to Ocheeva for a level dependent gold reward (up to 600 gold) and a single Infamy point. If you were not detected, you will receive Shadowhunt as a bonus: a leveled bow with Damage Health and Damage Magicka enchantments. If you failed to properly complete the Assassinated Man quest, Ocheeva will now promote you to the rank of Eliminator and give you the Sanctuary Well Key."

Travel to Harlun's Watch and speak to Drarana Thelis for more information. Check out the nearby swamps for the source of the mysterious ""strange lights"" near Swampy Cave. Search the cave area for the missing locals and kill the trolls. Return to Harlun's Watch with news about the missing locals. Report back to Burz gro-Khash for your reward and further instructions.","Investigate Harlun's Watch[edit] Speak to Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal and he will order you to investigate the disappearance of a group of locals at Harlun's Watch. Your contact there is Drarana Thelis. Travel to Harlun's Watch, which is just south of Cheydinhal and speak with Drarana about the disappearances. She'll tell you about people seeing ""strange lights"" in the swamps near old Swampy Cave, and failing to return after going to investigate. She asks for your help in determining what is going on. Strange Lights[edit] Travel southeast to Swampy Cave at the northern end of the Reed River. Outside the cave are three Will-o-the-Wisps, the likely source of the mysterious ""strange lights"". The Wisps can be quite a handful, so check the main creature article for suggestions on how to fight them. If you wish to avoid them altogether, you can enter the cave from a secondary entrance in the dip between two hills, further south along the lake. Doing this will not add the Swampy Cave marker to your map but you will still be able to explore the entire cave and complete the quest. Investigate Swampy Cave[edit] The remains of Eduard Denile Enter Swampy Cave from either of the two entrances and fight your way through the Swamp Trolls that inhabit it (see the place page for full walkthrough info). About half way into the first zone, you will come across the corpse of Eduard Denile and a number of other skeletal and decomposing remains. At this point your journal will update to say that you must kill all the Trolls in both zones (Swampy Cave and Swampy Cave Dry Rock Run). There are 15 trolls in total, and it is recommended not to exit the cave while in combat, as this may lead to a bug. When you've slain them all, head back to Drarana. Return to Harlun's Watch with News[edit] Return to Harlun's Watch and speak with Drarana about the fate of the missing locals. She will express remorse about their fate, thank you for your assistance and present you with the Mind and Body Ring, a leveled ring with Fortify Strength and Reflect Damage enchantments, as a token of the gratitude of the remaining residents of Harlun's Watch. Due to a bug, you will receive the most powerful version of the ring between levels 10-19. Return to Cheydinhal and report to Burz gro-Khash for the standard level-dependent gold reward and one Fame point. This is the last contract from Burz, so the next quest will depend on your previous actions: If you have already completed The Stone of St. Alessia, Burz will promote you to the rank of Champion. You will next need to go to Modryn Oreyn's house in Chorrol for the quest Information Gathering. Otherwise, Burz will restore you to the rank of Guardian and send you to Azzan in Anvil for the Stone of St. Alessia quest."

Close three Oblivion gates to receive training from Dagail.","Close Shut the Jaws of Oblivion[edit] The two advanced trainers who can give you the master training reference necessary to start this quest are Boderi Farano in the Arcane University and Ita Rienus in the Bravil Mages Guild Hall. They will direct you to the wise Dagail at the Leyawiin Mages Guild. Dagail will only provide master training once you have closed at least three Oblivion gates. The minimum number of Oblivion Gates you must close during the main quest is three, making this quest impossible to miss out on."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Namira","Once you have reached level 5, travel to the Shrine of Namira and talk to Hjolfrodi. You are deemed too attractive to worship Namira, so lower your personality to 20 or below. Once you are unattractive, speak with Hjolfrodi again and activate the shrine. You are next tasked with eliminating the priests of Arkay in the Anga ruin. You are given a special spell, Namira's Shroud to deal with them. Travel to the Ayleid ruin Anga and cast Namira's Shroud on the priests. Return to the shrine to be rewarded with the Ring of Namira.","Locating the Shrine of Namira[edit] Namira's Shrine is east-southeast of Bruma and northeast of where the Silver Road and the Orange Road meet. Unlike several other Shrines, nobody can point out its location. An Offering to the God[edit] Once there, talk to Hjolfrodi the Harrier to learn that you are too attractive to worship Namira. You need to lower your Personality to 20 or lower. As long as your Personality is at most 60, you can do this by drinking cheap wine (one effect of which is to drain Personality 10 points for 2 minutes), available in any town or city. Once back at the shrine, drink the wine and make sure your Personality is at or below 20. Quickly talk to Hjolfrodi and then quickly activate the shrine (both steps require low Personality). You dare approach my shrine, Child of the Light? You, who walk this plane basking in the light of the warm, cruel sun? Prove to me that you deserve my favor. In Anga, my Forgotten have lived in peace for many years. They worship me from the dark, basking in their misery and filth. Now, though, some would seek to bring light to their darkness. Priests of Arkay have intruded upon their squalor. I want you to help my Forgotten kill these priests of the Light. Cast this spell upon the priests. Allow my beloved Forgotten to kill the interlopers. When this is done, I shall reward you for your efforts. Reducing your Personality[edit] Drinking cheap wine is the easiest way to reduce your personality. Most chapels contain an abundance of cheap wine in their basements that is unowned and can be taken without penalty. If you need to reduce your personality by more than 40 (or 80) points, however, there are some options (all of which can be done in conjunction with drinking cheap wine): You can buy one of several unique items available in stores: Helm of Ferocity is a helmet with a constant-effect Drain Personality of 5 pts. Document of Purile Banter [sic] is a scroll that provides, among other effects, a Drain Personality of 50 pts for 150 secs. Chronicle of Sacrifice is a scroll that provides a Drain Personality of 50 pts for 30 secs, although be sure not to cast it at one of the priestesses. When using either of these scrolls, be sure you have nothing equipped that resists magic as this will weaken the drain effect. A custom Drain Personality on self spell can be made, although gaining access to this effect is difficult, as explained in more detail in the Drain Attribute article. If you have completed the Repairing the Orrery DLC quest, you can use the Orrery power Secunda's Opportunity (when available) to lower your personality by an additional 20 pts. The Scales of Pitiless Justice obtained from the Dark Brotherhood questline lowers personality when in your inventory, but it is only by two points, so it doesn't help much. If you are at least a Journeyman Alchemist, you can make a potion of Restore Fatigue with the side effect Damage Personality; an easily available set of ingredients are Flour and Leeks. Since this potion damages personality, you can consume however many are needed to reduce your personality to 20 or below. You will want to visit a shrine or make a potion of Restore Personality afterward to restore your personality. The Task at Hand[edit] Namira gives you the spell Namira's Shroud, a Novice-level alteration spell with a base cost of 50 Magicka. It is now time to carry out the task that Namira has set for you. Head to the Ayleid ruin Anga to the south of the shrine. To complete the quest, cast Namira's Shroud on each priest of Arkay in the ruins. Then, let the Forgotten kill them. Do not attack the priests yourself, or you will not get the reward. When all four priests are dead, you'll get a journal entry. Most characters should be able to cast Namira's Shroud, although characters with low Alteration skill levels will have a higher Magicka cost (see Spell List Notes) and may need fortified magicka. The main quest will take you to Cheydinhal before you are asked for a Daedric artifact. This gives you a chance to do the A Brush with Death quest and receive the Apron of Adroitness, which has enough Fortify Intelligence to enable low-intelligence characters to cast the spell. Returning to the Shrine[edit] Return to the shrine to receive the Ring of Namira, a ring with powerful Reflect Damage and Reflect Spell enchantments. You have cleansed my followers' perfect darkness. The Forgotten are free to wallow in their misery. Take my ring. Let it bring pain to others who would wish it upon you. Namira blesses you."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Necromancer%27s_Amulet","Speak to Hannibal Traven a few days after completing A Plot Revealed. He wants you to retrieve the Necromancer's Amulet from Fort Ontus. Find Caranya in Fort Ontus and kill her when she refuses to hand over the amulet. Fight your way out with the amulet and return to Arch-Mage Traven.","Council in Ruins[edit] Once you have been promoted to the rank of Wizard after completing A Plot Revealed, the Arch-Mage will inform you that the Council is in ruins after the events of the previous quest (after having just fallen into disarray upon being informed of the return of Mannimarco). As a part of this more recent upheaval, two artifacts, the Necromancer's Amulet and the Bloodworm Helm, were removed from the University by Caranya and Irlav Jarol, respectively. Having continued misgivings for the safety of the items and their current caretakers, the Arch-Mage wants you to retrieve the items back to the University for safekeeping. Being approximately equal in ease and difficulty, length and reward, and being unable to proceed until both are completed, there is no clear advantage of doing one or the other first and so the choice of which to complete first and which to complete second is up to you. Good Girl Gone Bad?[edit] According to Caranya, she took the Amulet to Fort Ontus in order to keep the University and Imperial City safe from being a target. The Arch-Mage will mark the location of the fort on your map, which is to the southwest of Chorrol. While the Arch-Mage does not disagree with Caranya's claims that the University and the City would be safer with the artifact elsewhere, he has reservations about the genuineness of her intentions. RemasteredOblivion Mysterious mages have occupied the fort. Mysterious mages have occupied the fort. Inside the Fort[edit] When you get to the fort, the mages inside will direct you straight to Caranya, who can be found in the center of the Ontus Understreets. When you get to her, Caranya will reveal that she is a necromancer and that she desires to recruit you to her movement. After it becomes clear that neither side will agree to the other's wishes, she attacks. Because Caranya is unarmored and allows you to get near her, she should not prove to be too difficult an opponent. She does however have powerful spells that could cause some serious damage when used in rapid succession, so using Silence and Resist Magic against her is recommended.  Another strategy is to initiate the fight, then retreat back through the gate. You may then safely use ranged attacks, as the gate makes her spells inaccurate. When she has been killed, take the Necromancer's Amulet from her body. Make Your Escape[edit] The mages of Fort Ontus will now reveal themselves to be Necromancers and attack on sight. Individually, they are far weaker than Caranya, but can be deadly in groups. Killing them one at a time before you face Caranya is one way to avoid complications here. After finding your way past the necromancers, return to the Arcane University and speak with Traven to complete the quest. If you have also completed The Bloodworm Helm, per usual, Traven will direct you to Raminus Polus for advancement to the next rank."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Necromancer%27s_Moon","Talk to Raminus Polus. He wants you to speak with Tar-Meena about Black Soul Gems. Speak to Tar-Meena, who can be found at the Mystic Archives. She tells you to find a book called Necromancer's Moon. Find the book in the lower room of the library on a small table. Take it back to Tar-Meena. Bring the book back to Raminus. He'll tell you to talk to Bothiel. Talk to Bothiel. She gives you a hastily scrawled note which you should take back to Raminus. Raminus tells you to go to Dark Fissure Cave at the next Shade of the Revenant to observe the ritual of creating Black Soul Gems. There are three ways to learn about the ritual: Waiting: Just stay outside the cave until the ritual occurs. It happens one night per week at midnight (a light will shine down on the altar). Just observe. Fighting: Explore the cave and find a Worm Anchorite. He will be the first person you encounter in the cave and will be immediately visible to you on the left path as soon as you enter the cave. Kill him, then search his body to find a Handwritten Note explaining the ritual (you can also pickpocket the note). Doing: Cast Soul Trap on the altar yourself when the time is right. This will trigger you ""seeing necromancers perform the ritual"". Once you've discovered the ritual or retrieved the note, return to Raminus.","Tar-Meena[edit] After completing Vahtacen's Secret, Raminus Polus will tell you that he needs to find information on Black Soul Gems from Tar-Meena. Just head over to the Mystic Archives. When you first talk to Tar-Meena, she'll rage a bit about how she's got too much to do already, but once you mention Black Soul Gems specifically she agrees to help you out. Tar-Meena instructs you to find a book called Necromancer's Moon and mentions that Falcar has borrowed it. The book can be found on a small table in the lower part of the Library. Take it back to Tar-Meena and she'll tell you a little more information on it, as well as on an interesting event called Shade of the Revenant, before sending you back to Raminus. Bothiel[edit] When you speak to Raminus, you find out that he's clueless on what Shade of the Revenant actually means, but he does take a wild guess. He thinks it may be some sort of celestial event. To that end, Raminus sends you to speak to Bothiel - the guild's resident expert on such things. Bothiel can usually be found either wandering the university grounds, or in the lobby. Sadly, she doesn't have any answers for you, but interestingly enough remembers Falcar - the mage that tried to send you to your doom during the Cheydinhal Recommendation quest - asking about the same thing. Bothiel then gives you a hastily scrawled note that he left behind. The note mentions four sites that don't mean much yet, so head back to Raminus to give him an update. The Shade of the Revenant appears above the Dark Fissure Dark Fissure[edit] After you tell him about the note, Raminus suggests that you visit Dark Fissure Cave (one of the sites from the list) at the next Shade of the Revenant. The cave is just south of Cheydinhal. Once you reach the cave you will find an altar set up, but you need to wait for the correct night to witness the actual event. On one night per week, a purple light shines down on the altar indicating that the necromancer rituals can be performed. You can wait to see the ritual occur. It always occurs for one complete day (from midnight to midnight). On the correct day, you can witness necromancers completing the ritual, thus advancing the quest. The Shade of the Revenant actually occurs every eight days; specifically, it occurs on the 1st, 9th, 17th, 25th, 33rd, etc. days of the game, using the ""Days Passed"" statistic on your character's statistics journal page, provided that you have not spent a day in jail (see here for more details). It occurs on the same day at all four locations. If there is no light when you arrive, you can use the wait command to wait 24 hours at a time. Or you can calculate when the next Shade of the Revenant will occur, go complete other quests, then return on the correct date. When waiting for the purple light, do not stand directly in front of the altar; back up so you can see the altar and a fair portion of sky. The purple light is very soft by the time it gets to the altar, and if you are standing directly in front of it you may not realize it is shining and wait right past it. Also, doing this at night will help. If you don't feel like waiting, enter the cave and find the Worm Anchorite who will be on the left as soon as you enter the cave. The quest merely requires you to acquire the Handwritten Note he possesses so you can either kill him and loot his body, or sneak up and pick his pocket. Either way, the note is sufficient proof for Raminus; you do not actually need to witness the ritual. The final way is to wait for the Shade of the Revenant as described above and then do the ritual yourself. For details on the procedure, see the page on Black Soul Gems. Basically, you need to place an empty Grand Soul Gem in the altar and then cast a Soul Trap spell on the altar. Even if you do it yourself, this will trigger the message about ""seeing necromancers perform the ritual"". This can be done at any of the 4 altars mentioned in Falcar's note. Once you've completed any one of these options, head back to the Arcane University, and speak to Raminus for advancement. He'll also tell you that Arch-Mage Traven will be giving you your duties from now on."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Newheim%27s_Flagon","Receive the quest details from Azzan. Discuss the contract with Maglir. Speak with Newheim the Portly to receive additional details and an optional mini-quest. Kill the thieves in Hrota Cave and (optionally) retrieve Newheim's Heirloom. Return to Azzan and Newheim for your rewards.","Azzan[edit] You can receive this contract from Azzan in the Anvil Fighters Guild after you've done a few jobs for Modryn Oreyn in Chorrol. He'll ask you to look for a den of thieves that has been responsible for a recent spate of thefts in the area, referencing your past contract to help Norbert Lelles: ""Good to see you're working hard. I've got some more thieves for you to deal with in Anvil. There have been a number of thefts in the area, and witnesses believe the thieves are holed up nearby. Check around, and see what you can learn."" Azzan pairs you up for this mission with Maglir, whom you met recently on a past contract: ""I'm not sure the numbers you'll be dealing with, so I'm sending you with another new recruit. Maglir. I believe you two have already met."" Maglir[edit] Maglir should be somewhere in the Anvil guild hall. He will be less than thrilled to work with you again regardless of your past choice to rat him out or not. Nevertheless, he'll offer some advice (and of course a complaint): ""Oh, it's you. Looks like we're working together. Sounds like we need to ask around Anvil for any clues. Figures we'd get a mission without any real direction. I'll follow you."" From this point on you can order him to follow you or wait for you to return. Newheim the Portly[edit] Speak to one of your guildmates or to one of the townsfolk about Thieves. If their disposition towards you is 60 or above they will tell you to speak with Newheim the Portly, a recent victim of the thievery. Newheim can be found at home or wandering around town, particularly on the dockside. When you find him, he'll confirm his knowledge of the thieves and provide their whereabouts: ""Aye. I know about those scum. Rotten bastards robbed me blind, they did. Stole a family heirloom. Bunch of Bosmer, if you can believe it! No offense to you and your friend/your friend, of course. Last I heard, they were holed up in Hrota Cave, not too far from here."" He'll point you towards the cave by saying, ""You'll find it north of Anvil. Good luck, and give it to those bastards good."" Newheim's Flagon[edit] The stolen flagon Newheim will also mention a family heirloom that was stolen, a flagon, and says he'll reward you if you can return it. This is an entirely separate quest in your journal labeled Newheim's Flagon. You must speak to Newheim about the Heirloom topic in order for the flagon to appear in the cave, so make sure you've heard the words ""Took my flagon, they did! Passed down to me from my father Rulf, and from his father Torbalt. It's a wondrous cup. Keeps ale cold and sweet. Been drinking from a lousy wooden tankard since. It's just not the same. If you can find it, you'd have the gratitude of Newheim the Portly!"" If you find his flagon, you can return it to him for a reward of three bottles of Newheim's Special Brew. Hrota Cave[edit] Head to the cave with Maglir in tow, who will encourage you with: ""Let's get rid of these guys, so we can get paid."" and ""Payday! Let's roll."".  There are eight thieves in the cave - Cingaer, Dennilwen, Githriian, Idrolian, Nedhelfin, Niraegaer, Thiirchel, and Thrangirfin; their respective pages have tips for defeating them. If you are a stealth-based character, you will want to leave Maglir at the cave entrance. Make your way through the cave with or without him and kill the thieves; you will need to slay them all for the quest to update. Take care of the tripwire in the hallway before the last room. Newheim's Heirloom is on a table in the east end of the cave, in the pit in the center of the largest chamber. You'll receive an update when all the thieves are dead, as well as when the flagon is found (for the appropriate quest). Maglir will also confirm the quest being near completion: ""We're done here. Let's go get paid."" and ""It's tavern time!"" Reward[edit] Head back to Azzan once the job is done for a standard level-dependent gold reward and one Fame point.  If you have already completed Amelion's Debt, Azzan will also be willing to promote you to the rank of Protector.  You will then have to head to Modryn Oreyn in Chorrol for your next quest, The Master's Son. If not, you will first need to go to Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal to complete Amelion's Debt next."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Next_of_Kin","Retrieve your next contract from a sack near the roots of the Great Oak tree in Chorrol. Go to Perennia Draconis' home, Applewatch, to kill her and collect a list of her children and their whereabouts. (See the below walkthrough and notes for details on how to kill Perennia and her family without incurring a bounty.) Locate and eliminate the four other family members. Proceed to the Skingrad Castle Courtyard for the next Dead Drop.","Targets[edit] The entire Draconis Family is your new target. You start this mission only knowing the location of one of the Draconis family members: the mother, Perennia Draconis. She lives all alone on her farm called Applewatch not far west of Bruma. When you arrive at her house, she asks what you are doing there. You can either tell her that you are looking for her children, and she will mistake you for a gift deliveryman, giving you a complete list of her children's whereabouts and 100 gold to buy the gifts, or you can kill her and take the list off her corpse. Be cautious however: years of living alone have left her tougher than she looks and she has a pet dog to defend her, but you shouldn't have too much trouble. If you approach her when she is sleeping, she will wake up for the conversation and then go back to sleep, allowing for an easy sneak attack. Sometimes she will be sitting in her chair reading a book. Make sure the dog isn't looking, and do a sneak attack from behind. If you kill her in one hit and the dog didn't see the attack, he will walk over then stand over her corpse and howl. From 6am to 2pm she can be found working outside, where she provides an easy kill without alerting the dog, who stays inside. If you answer in her dialogue options that you intend to kill her children, she will immediately become violent and both she and her dog will attack you, so you will not incur a bounty for killing her. Matthias Draconis[edit] Matthias Draconis lives in the Talos Plaza District of the Imperial City. His schedule provides several opportunities to kill him without incurring a bounty for murder. In his home: If he finds you trespassing in his private quarters, he will attack after he threatens to call the guards. However, he never actually calls the guards, and you can kill him without incurring a bounty. In the basement of Umbacano Manor: During the day, Matthias works as a guard in the basement of Umbacano Manor. It is possible to sneak into the basement and kill him with one blow, avoiding a bounty. If he catches you in the basement and you stand there for a few moments, he will attack you. If this happens, and you defend yourself, you will incur no bounty when he dies. Snipe: Matthias visits The Bloated Float Inn in the evening. He leaves the inn around 9pm, presenting an opportunity to snipe him from afar. If your Sneak skill is high and you are well hidden, he might not notice you as you pelt him with arrows. If no one sees you shoot him, you will not receive a bounty. Frenzy: While he is walking in the street near a guard, cast a Frenzy spell on him. He'll attack the guard, resulting in his death without incurring a bounty, since you are not his direct murderer. Caelia Draconis[edit] Your next target is Caelia Draconis, captain of the guard in Leyawiin. She patrols around town constantly. She can also be found in Castle Leyawiin, but for a certain time during the day (starting 7:30am) she can be found isolated in a private room at the Three Sisters' Inn. Walk up to her, tell her you are going to kill her, and she will attack (although she will alert the other guards and you will get a bounty of 1000 gold coins). Caelia, being a guard captain, is a very tough opponent and may not go down easily. If you have a decent Alchemy skill, simply make a couple of Damage Health poisons. Wait until there aren't any guards nearby (say, the middle of the night) and choose ""I'm afraid I need you. Dead."" Reduce her health yourself to a low enough level that the poison can finish her off. So long as she takes the last bit of damage from the poison, you get no bounty at all, as she attacked first. Tell her you are going to kill her and then run into the Blackwood Company or the Fighters or Mages Guild. She will follow you and be attacked and killed by the people inside without you so much as lifting a finger or incurring any bounty. Using the spirits: Twice per day she will be near the chapel. Go inside the chapel and pick the undercroft lock then leave. Once she is near the chapel (alone if possible), just tell her that you ""need to see her dead"" (she will aggro). then run into the chapel. Go downstairs into the undercroft, she will follow you there. Just let the ghost kill her while you dodge her attacks running through the pillars. Optionally you can just surrender to her and let her face the ghost. You won't get any bounty, not even a 40 gold for assaulting her. Optional advice: remove any ""reflect damage gear"" or you will get charged for assault. Advice 2: if you have any problem with magic wear some Resist Magic or Absorb Spell gear to avoid getting wounded by the ghosts as well. Three Sisters Inn 2: If you have high Sneak and Marksman skills, you can track her to the Three Sisters Inn late at night, break into the second floor, and sneak into a shadowed corner. She will be sitting by a table, unaware of your presence and will fall easily to a few sneaky arrows if you have hidden yourself well enough and she doesn't notice you. If she sees you, you will still get a bounty. Snipe: Wait until nightfall, follow her, and she will eventually visit the cemetery behind the Chapel of Zenithar. Then is your chance to snipe her with an arrow. However, you will get a 1000 gold bounty - even if you kill her with the first shot. You can avoid this by using a slow-acting poison. You will just receive a 40 gold bounty for assault. Frenzy: While she is sleeping in the barracks, cast a Frenzy spell on her. She'll attack the guards, resulting in her death without any bounty since you are not the direct murderer. Gray Fox: If you kill her with the Gray Cowl on, your Gray Fox persona gets the bounty instead of your normal persona. This is most easily done at her day posting in the Three Sisters Inn. Cingor: If you can sufficiently lower Cingor's disposition he will automatically attack you, if you lead him to Caelia with his health intact (you can heal him with a Convalescence spell if his health is getting low) he is capable of finishing her in a fight, allowing you to just quickly finish off Cingor, all without a bounty. During the Fighters Guild quest ""The Hist"", if she's patrolling at night and near the entrance to the Blackwood Company's door when you are told to go there, enter quickly, get the scripted greeting, then immediately exit and head towards her. She will then enter and attack, and will be quickly overpowered leading to death. Timing is key, but you won't have a bounty nor have to look for her later on. This method can be used with other characters to kill her for you at any time as she's not set as essential before this quest. Cursed Item: Add a Damage Self effect on a bound helmet and reverse pickpocket it into her. She doesn't eat so the poison apple does not work, but she does equip armor items when she enters the Three Sisters Inn. Andreas Draconis[edit] The next closest target is Andreas Draconis who runs the Drunken Dragon Inn, northeast of Leyawiin. Taunt him: Talk to Andreas and tell him that his mother ""bled like a pig"" or that you want him dead. He will then attack you and you can kill him without a bounty, possibly with the help of the resident Imperial Guard. If he's standing on the opposite side of the table, he won't reach you with his blows. Frenzy: Cast a Frenzy spell on him. He'll attack the Imperial Guard who is in the inn and you won't receive a bounty because you're not the direct murderer. Sneak attack: If your Sneak skill is high enough, you can walk behind the counter, behind him, and kill him while you are hidden. Be careful, as you must do this while the guard's back is turned to make sure you don't get a bounty. Sibylla Draconis[edit] The final member of the Draconis family is Sibylla Draconis who lives in Muck Valley Cavern, southwest of Cheydinhal. The cave is inhabited by leveled natural predators. Sibylla has a very high Aggression and is likely to attack on sight unless her disposition towards you is high due to high fame, infamy, and personality scores. Even if non-hostile, she has no conversation beyond the normal rumors. If she does not attack you on sight, she subsequently can be triggered to attack you by drawing your weapon, similar to the way the Unicorn behaves in the Hircine Quest when any weapon is drawn. You will not get a bounty if she attacks you for drawing your weapon. If this battle is overwhelming for your character, simply flee the cave. Sibylla will follow you, but her animal companions will not be able to exit the cave. Outside, your trusty steed, Shadowmere, will come to your defense and is quite capable of killing Sibylla on her own. Sibylla does not eat, so poisoned apples do not work on her. She does not sleep either, so she cannot be made to wear cursed items. Finish[edit] After you have eliminated all the family members, proceed to the Castle Skingrad Courtyard to obtain your reward and next target."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Night_Mother%27s_Child","Receive your assignment from Ocheeva. Travel to Skingrad and enter Summitmist Manor. Choose a method and kill everyone in the Manor. (Optional) Convince the remaining guests that you are not the killer. Return to Ocheeva for the reward.","The Night Mother's Child[edit] The mini-quest to get your next contract from Ocheeva is titled ""The Night Mother's Child"". You will be directed to Skingrad to meet Fafnir, a Dark Brotherhood assassin posing as a doorman for a house party in Summitmist Manor. He'll provide you a key and some details on the party. Once you enter the manor, you will not be allowed to leave until the contract is fulfilled. Your objective is to kill everyone within Summitmist Manor, while the other guests are under the impression they have to look for a treasure. In order to get your bonus, you must not be observed/suspected by the remaining guests. All of the guests have a tiny amount of health, making them easy kills. When you have finished, return to Ocheeva for your reward of up to 600 gold (level dependent), and if you have achieved it, a bonus of the Night Mother's Blessing: a permanent +2 to your Marksman, Security, Sneak, Acrobatics and Blade skills. Playing with your Victims[edit] While Gogron gro-Bolmog might applaud such brutal efficiency, it's certainly more fun to be creative. An interesting method to achieve your goal is the manipulation of your targets. As some of your Dark Brotherhood companions will tell you before you execute the contract, your (possible) reward from Bad Medicine, The Deceiver's Finery, will come in handy during this contract, as it provides a nice boost to personality and speechcraft. Raise each target's disposition high enough (70 or more) and you'll eventually be able to gain their trust, meaning that they will suspect you the least, if at all. This relationship will prove beneficial in disposing of them. Also try lowering the disposition of the guests; they will begin to suspect you as the killer. Depending on their respective aggressiveness, they may even attack you. Note that if the last guest fingers you as the killer, this does not forfeit the bonus. Execute the quest under the parameters of ""undetected"" and you will still receive the Night Mother's Blessing. Snipe from across the room with your bow. Use poisoned apples, which can be purchased from M'raaj-Dar in the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. Only Nels cannot be killed this way. If you don't feel like taking the time to raise their dispositions, an alternative method of getting them to do your dirty work is to use Frenzy and watch them kill each other. If you opt to bribe the guests, you can recover all of your money from their corpses at the conclusion of the quest. If you equip the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal with low personality or fame, the guests may attack you. If you kill them with this method, you won't lose your bonus. Guest Details[edit] Dovesi Dran: Talk to Primo about her. He'll tell you that he rather likes her, and asks you to ""put in a good word"" for him. Go to her, and if you have raised her disposition, she will confide in you that she is attracted to Primo, also. Tell her that he said for her to wait for him in his room. She will run off excitedly to his room, at which point she will be isolated and a prime target. After one of the guests has died, she will give you the option to say a few things to assuage her fears of being killed, one of which is the familiar [Say Nothing]. If you choose this, she goes down to the basement alone and sits on a stool facing the wall, making herself easy pickings. She dislikes Matilde (accurately accusing her of being racist). If she is the last one you leave alive, she will beg for her life, unless her disposition is raised high (in which case she will try to enlist you to help her escape). She doesn't understand why people call Nels naughty. She thinks he seems nice. With a high disposition she can be turned against the 'second to last' victim, including Primo. Matilde Petit claims to be a Breton aristocrat. She will greet you when you walk in; tell her that you're an assassin to earn a disposition bonus, as she will view your reply as a grand joke, even if you're wearing the Shrouded Armor and have a knife in your hand. Wait a while and she'll offer to work with you to find the treasure. You will be able to send her to the basement, where she will be alone and prime for killing. Matilde doesn't like Dovesi because she's Dunmer, and is disgusted by Nels because he told her ""the most off-color joke about an Argonian maid"". She is more fond of Neville and Primo. If she and Dovesi are the last two alive and her disposition towards you is high, she'll attempt to kill Dovesi. Nels the Naughty likes to drink. He stands in the same spot all the time, and is an easy target when no other guests are present. He likes Dovesi because she reminds him of his late daughter. He doesn't dislike Primo, but Nels will begin to suspect him earlier on in the quest. He dislikes Neville because the Imperial Legion refused to help him and his fellow villagers when they were attacked by bandits in Solstheim, leading to the death of his daughter Olga. If he and Neville are the last two alive, Nels will likely pick up any nearby weapon and attempt to kill him. Also, if you have raised his disposition high enough, he will attack Matilde if he and she are the last two guests left. If he's the last one alive, he will head for the basement. If Nels and Dovesi are the last two alive, and you have a high disposition with Nels, he will choose to believe that the attacker must be coming in through the window rather than believe that you or Dovesi could be the killers. Dovesi has no such inhibitions about killing Nels however... Nels can also be convinced to kill Primo if they are the last two alive. Nels is the only guest who, even with maxed disposition, will still recognize you as the murderer if you killed all the other guests yourself. He also appears to be unique in that he fits Primo's description of him, that behind the drunkard he is hard and calculating. He is the only guest who realizes, relatively early, that there is an assassin sent to kill them and not a greedy guest. Neville is the soldier type. He sleeps long and soundly. He hates Nels and sees Primo as bored. If he and Nels are the last two alive, he'll head to his room to retrieve his gear so that he may try to kill Nels (disposition of 70 required to persuade Neville to attack Nels). He pities Matilde and her loss of income, and thinks that Dovesi doesn't like him, which is true. If Neville is the last one left alive and your disposition is high enough when you talk to him, he says that he will find an axe and try to chop down the door. It is during his attempt to break down the door that he is most easily killed. If his disposition is low however and he is the last one alongside you, he will conclude you are the assassin and attack you. Even equipped in his Imperial Legion armor, he is laughably easy to kill, as he has only 1 hitpoint. Him figuring you out as the murderer does not affect your bonus either. Primo Antonius is an Imperial from a wealthy family. He sits around the ground floor most of the time. He doesn't believe that Matilde is really an aristocrat, and is attracted to Dovesi. He views Nels as the tragic drunk and Neville as the typical greedy soldier. If Primo and either Dovesi, Neville, Nels, or Matilde are the last two left alive, talk to Primo and he'll attempt to kill the remaining guest (assuming your disposition towards him is high enough). Each Guest's Opinions[edit] Here is a brief summary of what each guest feels about the others. Dovesi is attracted to Primo, likes Nels, doesn't like Neville, and hates Matilde. Matilde likes Primo and Neville, and dislikes Dovesi and Nels. Nels likes Dovesi, doesn't like or dislike Primo, dislikes Matilde, and hates Neville. Neville likes Dovesi and Matilde, views Primo as bored, and hates Nels. Primo is attracted to Dovesi, and doesn't like or dislike Nels and Neville and hates Matilde."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:No_Rest_for_the_Wicked","Take the key from Valtieri, and make your way through the sewers. Find Valen Dreth in his cell, and kill him. (Optional) Do not kill any guards. Exit the prison and return to Valtieri.","No Rest for the Wicked[edit] The mini-quest to get the contract from Vicente Valtieri is named ""No Rest for the Wicked"". Vicente will tell you your next target is Valen Dreth. The name may sound familiar—he was the Dark Elf taunting you inside the Imperial Dungeon at the very beginning of the game. Revenge is a dish best served cold. Getting through the Sewers[edit] You return to the Imperial dungeon basically the same way that you got out in the tutorial: through the Imperial Prison Sewer to the northeast of the Imperial City. Valtieri gives you the key, which is necessary because the sewer was sealed shut following your escape. Have a few lockpicks handy as there are a couple gates that do not open with the sewer key. Early on there is a detour through a couple of sewer sections that you did not previously visit, but then you'll proceed through the same Sanctum and Imperial Subterrane as before. If in doubt, follow your map marker. Caution is needed in the Sanctum and in the first part of the Imperial Subterrane: guards have been posted to prevent any more prisoners from escaping. All will attack you on sight. To get the bonus you need to be sure to not kill any of them (Detect Life spells or enchantments are useful). Pause for a minute when you first enter the Sanctum to hear the guards' humorous complaints about this new duty. By keeping to the shadows and waiting patiently for the guards to move along it is possible to sneak past all of them. The most attentive guard is the one when you enter the Imperial Subterrane; he is the only one who is carrying a torch and is more actively patrolling. If you're interested, take a slight detour into the room where the emperor was actually killed. You will find a small shrine to the emperor (including items that can be stolen), a dead Mythic Dawn agent with some notes about the investigation, and the guard leading the investigation, Captain Gepard Montrose. Luckily, the captain is too immersed in his own thoughts to notice an assassin sneaking around right behind him. In fact, it is very possible to pickpocket him and acquire all the keys for the prison, but it is not necessary, because they are easily attainable in the next part of the quest. Assassination[edit] Dreth will be in the same cell as before, across the hall from your former cell. When you first get to the cells, stop and patiently wait for the talkative guard chatting with Valen to leave. If he does not leave, it is possible to shoot Dreth with a bow and arrow from a distance without the guard seeing you. If you pickpocketed Captain Montrose, you already have the key to Dreth's cell. Otherwise, another set of keys are sitting on a small table to the left of the cell. The lock can also be picked. However, once you open his cell be sure to kill him quickly (if possible, with one hit), otherwise he will take off running through the sewers, which leads to a long annoying chase. The other option is to kill him using a bow or destruction magic, or summon an ally on the opposite side of the door; in all of these cases, you do not need to open the cell door. To get back out, you have two options. You can stealthily return through the sewer system. Or, using the Imperial Prison Key, you can go up the stairs and leave through the front door. Once you get into the main prison area you are in a public area; being spotted here won't cause you to be arrested or forfeit your bonus. Payoff[edit] Return to Vicente for a level dependent gold reward (up to 600 gold). If no guards died, you will also receive the bonus Scales of Pitiless Justice, a miscellaneous item that increases your Strength, Agility, and Intelligence attributes by 2 but also reduces your Personality by 2 whenever it is in your inventory."

Fight your way through the cave and recover his notes in the third level. Return to Lithnilian to be rewarded with 3-9 level-dependent potions.","Imperial Bridge Inn[edit] To get the quest, travel to the Imperial Bridge Inn; it's just north of the first 'S' in the word 'Silverfish River' on your map. Inside the inn, you will meet an Altmer Sorcerer, Lithnilian, who proceeds to tell you about his research into natural growing Welkynd Stones in Bramblepoint Cave, and how he was disrupted by creatures and forced to flee, leaving his precious notes behind. Bramblepoint Cave[edit] Bramblepoint Cave is west of the inn on the north bank of the Silverfish River, near its mouth, just north-northeast of Cadlew Chapel. Bramblepoint Cave has three levels, and Lithnilian's Research Notes can be found in the last one. Guarding them are up to three standard enemies and a boss-level monster, so the fight may be challenging. You will find the notes in a chest next to his bedroll; also close by are a boss chest and the living Welkynd formations. Grab the notes and head off back to the Imperial Bridge Inn for your reward. Leveled Reward[edit] Consult the following chart for your level-dependent reward. If the chart says three potions, you will receive three identical potions. If it says six potions, you will get three of one type, and three of a second type. However, the message on the screen will only inform you of one set of three; you need to check your inventory to find out about the other three. Similarly, if the chart says nine potions, you will receive three different types of potions, but you will only be told about one type.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Nocturnal","Once you have reached level 10, approach the shrine, and you'll be asked to recover the Eye of Nocturnal from a pair of thieves. Ask around Leyawiin to find out that the thieves are Argonians living in town. Locate the thieves, and speak to them. You will receive a quest message instructing you to eavesdrop on their conversation. Overhear their discussion to learn the Eye is in Tidewater Cave. Recover the artifact, and return it to the shrine. Upon your return, you are rewarded with the Skeleton Key.","Locating the Shrine of Nocturnal[edit] Eye of Nocturnal in Tidewater Cave, hidden among the rocks behind an underwater chest Nocturnal's Shrine is located off the Yellow Road north of Leyawiin, just past Blankenmarch. On the in game map, it is due west of the words County Leyawiin. Optionally, you can add a map marker to your map by talking to Alves Uvenim in Leyawiin Mages Guild (topic ""Daedra shrines""; you must have already read Modern Heretics or have spoken with Ulene Hlervu about ""Cheydinhal""). While you need to be at least level 10 to start this quest, an offering is not required. When you approach the shrine, you will be asked to recover the Eye of Nocturnal from a pair of thieves that are hiding out in Leyawiin. Night among strangers. Secrets in the dark. Nocturnal is here. But my Eye is blind and drowned, stolen from its shrine, and hid in dark waters. To steal from a god is most unwise. In Leyawiin, two Argonians think themselves secret, but the Eye has seen them. Find these thieves in the city that spans the waters. Learn where they hide my Eye. Retrieve the Eye of Nocturnal, mortal, and return it to me, and I shall look favorably upon you. The Task at Hand[edit] Talking to people in town, of which Imperial guards are most helpful (use the topic ""Leyawiin"", not ""Eye of Nocturnal""), will net you: Eye of Nocturnal: ""Eye of Nocturnal? Doesn't sound familiar to me."" Leyawiin: ""Weebam-Na and Bejeen have been bragging about some big score they made recently. They claim it's a valuable jewel. Who knows with those two."" You discover the thieves are a pair of Argonians living in town (Bejeen and Weebam-Na). A brief discussion with the thieves themselves will get you a quest message, asking you to eavesdrop on the pair to discover the location of the Eye. Sometimes you must leave and come back before they begin to talk. The best option is to sneak into their house and wait out of sight: if they realize that someone is listening to them they will stop talking. They reveal the Eye is hidden somewhere called Tidewater Cave, where the resident trolls act as the perfect guards. The cave is located on the coast of Topal Bay, to the south-southeast of Leyawiin and can be moderately tough; it's heavily populated with Kalperklan Trolls as well as leveled animals, and has two Azhklan Trolls outside.  The eye is pretty easy to find. Take a left at the first intersection, then another when that path dead ends, and then one more. The eye is underwater, behind a leveled chest, but is so large and glowing it's hard to miss. Returning to the Shrine[edit] Return the eye to the shrine, and Nocturnal will give you the Skeleton Key and increase your Fame by one point. The Skeleton Key is an unbreakable and ever-lasting lockpick that boosts your security skill by 40 points whenever it is in your inventory. My Eye is returned, and I once again see into the darkness that is your world. We mock the thieves, for bitter is their loss. You, mortal, may take this. It shall open the secrets of dark places for you."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Nothing_You_Can_Possess","After selling Umbacano three Ayleid statues, he'll give you a key and ask you to recover a carving from the High Fane. Find out where the High Fane is (it's now called Malada). Enter Malada and proceed till you find the door unlocked by Umbacano's key.  The carving is just inside. On the way out you'll be ambushed by another of Umbacano's treasure hunters. Return the carving to Umbacano for your reward.","In the Imperial City[edit] This quest is only obtained after selling Umbacano the third ancient Ayleid statue in the prior quest, The Collector. Umbacano tells you that he wants you to recover a special decorative carving from an Ayleid ruin called the High Fane (no apparent relation to the High Fane in the temple of Vivec in Morrowind). This was an important Ayleid structure in the mythic age and, although he does not know its exact location, he has found the key that gives access to where the carving is stored. He believes the ruin is probably known by another name now, shows you a sketch of the Fane, and asks if you recognize it. If you've read the book Cleansing of the Fane, you'll know the modern name of the ruin, and can answer that it is currently called Malada. Umbacano offers to pay you a leveled amount of gold if you can recover the carving. You will also recognize the drawing if you've already been to Malada. Otherwise, when you leave Umbacano Manor, you are approached by a man named Claude Maric. Claude reveals that he is also a treasure hunter employed by Umbacano and that he wishes to speak with you over a drink at the Tiber Septim inn across the plaza. Assuming you haven't read the book, you can ask Claude about the High Fane and he'll point you towards it; he suggests trying a rare bookshop, and it turns out it's on the shelf at First Edition. If you raise his disposition high enough, he'll actually tell you the modern name himself. The quest plays out the same if you never talk to Claude (possible if you have previously been to Malada) or if you do not ask Claude about the Fane or Malada. Inside Malada[edit] The Ayleid Carving Travel to Malada; it's a long trek into the southeast portion of the province, but there is an unmarked road that leads there straight from Mackamentain, which you may have visited during The Collector. When you get there you may see a small camp where you'll meet Brucetus Festinius and Rigmor, along with a Khajiit named S'razirr standing on a ridge southwest of the ruin. If you ask Brucetus and Rigmor about Malada they will tell you that they are only there for the ""fresh air and hunting"". Alternatively if you talk to S'razairr, increase his disposition to 65, then ask him about ""Claude Maric"", he will admit that he is working for him, but he does not like him much and will offer to abandon him and help you when he sees an opportunity to do so. In return, you will pay him part of your reward. He will initially ask for a half, but you can choose to negotiate by choosing the ""I'll give you twenty percent"" dialogue. S'razirr will refuse, but if your Speechcraft skill is greater than 50, he will agree to do it for a quarter. In exchange, he will help defend you in a difficult fight later in the quest, although he will not help you inside the ruin. Whatever you decide, enter the ruin. The carving in question is past a locked door that requires a key. The lock mechanism looks quite unusual, and it is opened by the High Fane Key given to you by Umbacano. Taking the carving causes the wall to collapse (stand back to avoid taking damage) and reveals the door to the second zone of Malada, Malada Aldmerisel. There is no need to continue into the second zone to complete the quest, though venturing farther will yield a Varla stone and several chests worth of loot. Ambush![edit] When you exit the ruin, Claude is waiting for you. His greeting is scripted, and he will detect you even if you are sneaking, invisible, or chameleoned.  He asks you to turn the carving over to him. If you give him the carving he'll turn and walk off. If you let him keep the carving you'll miss out on the reward given to you by Umbacano, but may still be able to get the third quest. You can of course pickpocket the carving from him as he's walking away. If you give him the carving and attack him quickly enough, just before you deal a killing blow to Claude, he and any other survivors will cease fighting and Claude may be talked to in order to re-obtain the carving.  He comments, ""I know when I'm beaten! Here, take the carving, if it means so much to you. I had no idea you would take things so personally.""  They will then leave as usual. If you refuse to give him the carving, he does not attack you as expected. Rather, he orders his three compatriots to kill you, turns invisible, then tries to escape on his horse. His friends come rushing in from hiding places and attack you. This can be a tough fight, but if you chose to accept S'razirr's help, he will aid you by attacking his fellow mercenaries rather than you. Alternatively, if you want to avoid a fight, you can run away. Note that Chameleon is effective against Claude's three friends. You can also kill all three of Claude's employees before you enter the ruin. If you do this, Claude won't even bother showing up. Note however, that this will count as murder and will cause the Dark Brotherhood questline to start. Alternately, just as you step outside the ruin you can cast a frenzy spell that covers enough area to include Maric's henchmen then run for it or duck back into the ruin for a minute. He won't give his little talk and will run off if any of them turn hostile towards him. Once the spell wears off the henchmen become neutral towards you. If you raise his disposition high enough beforehand, Claude may accept a yield. After this, he will run away, his henchmen will kill S'razirr, and you may keep the carving. You can also avoid the encounter entirely by fast traveling as you leave the ruin, before you are spoken to. Once you defeat them, return to the Imperial City and give the carving to Umbacano. He'll pay you the money promised as well as give you a new assignment: the Secrets of the Ayleids quest. If you chose the assistance of S'razirr and he survives the fight outside Malada, you may travel to the Tiber Septim Hotel (next to Umbacano's house) and uphold your end of the bargain. S'razirr will remain at the hotel until you pay him.  If you refuse to pay him he will follow you everywhere, and when you leave the city, he will attack you."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Of_Secret_And_Shadow","Read Lucien's letter to you. Meet him in Fort Farragut. Eliminate everyone in the Sanctuary. Return to Lucien for your reward and your new way to receive contracts.","Of Secret And Shadow[edit] The ""Of Secret And Shadow"" mini-quest directs you to talk to Ocheeva. She tells you that you have received a letter from Lucien. Apparently the Black Hand itself has a task for you. For more details, you need to travel to Lucien's current residence in Fort Farragut, just northeast of Cheydinhal. The letter also warns you that you must not speak to anyone in the Sanctuary about the letter and you should be careful about the residents of the fort. Fort Farragut[edit] The tower is full of undead and traps and may prove somewhat difficult if you aren't prepared. However, you can bypass everything and enter through the secret door. This door is located just outside Fort Farragut, inside a hollowed out tree immediately northwest of the fort's tower. When you find Lucien, he tells you about the assassin among the assassins that you may have already heard about. He tells you that you are not a suspect because you are a new member, but the assassin is definitely in the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. Lucien informs you that you must perform a Purification upon the Sanctuary. This means that you must kill every member of the Dark Brotherhood in Cheydinhal that Lucien names (Schemer and the Dark Guardian are above suspicion for their own reasons). As you have become a Silencer, you are permanently exempt from following the Five Tenets. Elimination[edit] You should have no problem killing the Sanctuary members. Lucien gives you some items which may help you in your mission, and you don't have to fight all the members at the same time. If you are seen killing any of the Sanctuary residents, the people who see you (including the Dark Guardian) will lose 70 disposition points. This may be enough to cause them to attack you. The only people who may give you trouble are Gogron gro-Bolmog, Teinaava, and Vicente. Teinaava and Vicente have good swords and Gogron wears heavy armor and carries an enchanted battle axe. Getting rid of Telaendril may be tricky, as she is absent from the city on Loredas and Sundas. One way to determine her whereabouts is looting Ocheeva's corpse and acquiring Telaendril's note. You can also follow her quest marker on your map. If you don't want to follow her around, you can wait until Middas, when she returns to the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. Alternatively, you can find her near the Mages Guild on Turdas. You can choose an appropriate dialogue option to infuriate her and prompt her to attack you. If you run to any nearby guards, they will take care of her for you, saving you the trouble of fighting and an unnecessary bounty. It is also possible for Telaendril to get killed by bandits while travelling. You can also reverse-pickpocket a poisoned apple into her inventory, which allows you to kill her in public without incurring a bounty (assuming you were not seen pickpocketing her). Introduction to Dead Drops[edit] Once you have killed everyone, return to Lucien. He tells you that you will no longer be receiving your contracts face-to-face but instead from letters in ""dead drops"". Each dead drop location will be revealed to you once you have completed your previous contract. The dead drop will hold your reward and the next contract. Lucien tells you the location of your first dead drop and gives you his horse, Shadowmere. Shadowmere is a very fast and strong horse, and is the only ""quest essential"" horse, meaning that she cannot die. She is extremely helpful for getting to the various dead drops and locations of the upcoming contracts."

You can go back to Seridur's house and speak with him before you head off to find Roland, but he will just say that the Order cannot go with you as fighting isn't their specialty. You can alternatively proceed directly to Roland's cabin. Travel to Roland's cabin east of the Imperial City in the Heartlands and speak with him, and he will tell you quite a different story. He claims that Seridur is the real vampire and the killer of the woman Roland loved. It is up to you to believe or dismiss his story. If you decide to attack Roland, he will continue to proclaim his innocence and will not die without a fight. After you kill him, return to Seridur to receive a 250 gold reward. Afterwards, Seridur dismisses you and the quest will be finished. The Real Vampire[edit] If you choose to hear Roland out, the quest continues. Roland will thank you for believing in him and refer you to Phintias, owner of the First Edition bookstore in the Imperial City's Market District. Talk to Phintias, and if his disposition is high enough (60+), he'll tell you Seridur comes in occasionally to buy books and that he once overheard Seridur mention Memorial Cave just outside of the Imperial City. Phintias will mark the location on your map; travel there to continue the quest. The cave is inhabited by vampires, undead, and other leveled creatures such as timber wolves and rats. Search the cave for Seridur (you'll spot the green quest marker after you travel in a bit), killing all who stand in your way or using stealth to bypass them. There is a chance you may contract Porphyric Hemophilia, so be sure to cure it if you want to avoid becoming a vampire yourself. Also, be sure to loot the vampire dust from any vampires you kill, and hold on to it; it will become quite valuable once this quest is completed. When you finally find Seridur he will tell you that he knew hiring you was a mistake but that the other members of the Order insisted, and that he lured you to the cave in order to dispose of you. Once he finishes his rather lengthy monologue, he will attack you. His speed is extremely high and he can be a real challenge for low level characters, so use caution when confronting him. Dispose of him, loot his body, and return to Roland's cabin. Reward[edit] Roland will be overjoyed and decide that the Order should probably continue. He will tell you to meet him at the now-departed Seridur's house where the Order meets. The other members of the Order will apologize to you for not suspecting that Seridur was the real vampire. Roland will state that he's been made the new leader of the Order of the Virtuous Blood and reward you with the leveled Ring of Sunfire, which has Resist Disease and Reflect Spell enchantments. Roland will also make you an honorary member of the Order of the Virtuous Blood. For every portion of vampire dust you bring in, he will pay you 250 gold; this offer holds for the rest of the game (see Vampire Dust for details on which types of vampire dust actually qualify for the bonus)."

Defeat or evade Lord Lovidicus, and find his journal. Return to Agronak with the journal.","The Origin[edit] Speak to Agronak gro-Malog in the Arena Bloodworks about ""The Gray Prince"" to begin the quest. He asks you to find proof of his noble birth, marks the location of Crowhaven on your map and gives you a mysterious key, but he is unsure what it opens. Journey to Crowhaven (northwest of Anvil) to begin your search. Bring cure disease potions or spells if possible as you may catch something from one of the denizens of this forlorn place. Enter Crowhaven—the presence of evil is unmistakable—and explore, killing all in your path until you find the locked ""Old Wooden Door"" (gro-Malog's mysterious key will open it) and continue inside. You'll eventually find Lord Lovidicus who will attack you on sight. Dispose of him and continue on, exploring the area to find several chests, various small treasures, and the journal of the recently departed Lord Lovidicus on a table. If you sneak, no fighting is necessary. Only the journal is needed; take it, and leave if you choose. Reward[edit] Return with the journal to Agronak gro-Malog in the Arena Bloodworks, and receive the Gray Prince's Training (permanent +3 to Blade, Block and Athletics) as your reward. Note that this training is treated as a permanent ability by the game and does not count toward leveling up, unlike most other free skill boosts. After Agronak trains you he will read the journal. He will be totally horrified at his vampire origins, so much in fact, that he will be completely convinced that he is a spawn of evil and does not deserve to live. As a result, he will not fight back when you fight him at the end of the Arena Quest."

He warns you that the portal will close behind you once you enter. Tell him that you are ready and he will open it. Go through as if it were an Oblivion Gate. Friend or Foe?[edit] You will hear Mankar Camoran's voice in your head; however, you can more or less ignore it. Follow the broken white path through the garden but, beware of leveled daedra, until you find the Dremora Kathutet. Unlike other Dremora, he will not attack you on sight; he has heard of your exploits and deems you worthy to speak to - no small honor among the haughty Dremora. Since Kathutet holds no loyalty to Camoran, he is willing to help you proceed if you provide a service to him. He has the Bands of the Chosen, which you will need to enter the Forbidden Grotto, which lies between you and Camoran. You can get them several ways. You can simply kill him and loot the Bands from his corpse. Alternatively, you can accept the task he gives you, which requires travelling to a cave (follow map marker) and knocking out two logs holding a boulder back that has trapped the Xivilai Anaxes. If you kill Anaxes, you will find Kathutet where he was before; he will become hostile and you'll be forced to fight him. However you choose, carry on until you reach the Forbidden Grotto. Camoran will continue to talk to you. Fight your way through, then put on the Bands of the Chosen when you get to the exit. If you have freed Anaxes, Kathutet will meet you here to give you the Bands of the Chosen. You can now enter the next area. The Bands of the Chosen[edit] Once in the Grotto, you cannot leave while still wearing the Bands of the Chosen, and you cannot remove them yourself. Fight your way through the Grotto, and eventually you will be approached by Eldamil, an Altmer Mythic Dawn Agent. Eldamil has grown disillusioned with Camoran's vision, and will offer to remove the bands if you tell him that you plan to kill his master. Eldamil will ask you to act like his prisoner. Soon a Dremora (Orthe) will approach and test your prisoner-like qualities. You will be told to step into the nearby cage to be lowered into the lava river. Your trust in Eldamil was well placed, as he won't lower you into the lava. You will be raised back up and Eldamil will tell you to meet him in the next area where he will remove your bands, as he cannot cross the lava himself. Meet him there and he'll do just that. He might die (maybe killed by Orthe himself), but it doesn't matter: he's as immortal as the other creatures in this Paradise. Alternatively, you can just attack and kill Orthe when he begins to talk with Eldamil. You're now able to escape through the next door and back into Paradise. Eldamil will continue to follow you for the remainder of the quest. The Master[edit] Follow the path to Carac Agaialor (Camoran's Palace). If you stray too far off the path you'll be warped back to the door you just left. Going down the path, you'll meet Mankar's children, who will tell you they've been expecting you and that their father is waiting for you. They will lead you to their father's throne room, where Camoran himself awaits you with the Amulet. He will enter a long monologue about how the Septim Dynasty has ended and the coming of Dagon cannot be stopped, and that you are powerless against him in his Paradise. Listen if you're interested, otherwise you can start the fight any time by attacking. You will have to face Mankar, Raven, and Ruma all at once. Raven will summon Mythic Dawn Armor and a bound sword to attack you, while Ruma will stay back and use her staff (a random leveled destruction staff) at range. If Eldamil is still following you, he will aid you in the battle, hopefully keeping at least one opponent distracted. If killed, Eldamil, Raven and Ruma will all reappear a few seconds later, as they are immortal. The only way to end the battle is to kill Mankar. Mankar himself is very powerful. He possesses a variety of innate abilities and magical gear imbuing him with resistance to Magic, Frost, Shock, and physical attacks, making him vastly more resilient than a typical opponent. He is a Master of Conjuration magic and will summon powerful leveled Daedra, and he has a variety of other magic, including Silence, strong healing spells, and Disintegrate Armor and Shock Damage spells cast by his staff. He also has a fairly large amount of health, and his robes have reflect damage and spell absorption enchantments on them so use caution when attacking him. Focus on Mankar, unless you want to loot the others, because they'll keep respawning until you kill their father. It is possible to kill them before entering the area with Mankar. They will still respawn, but this will buy you a little time in which you will have two fewer people attacking you. As soon as Mankar is dead, Raven, Ruma, and Eldamil will all die instantly and Paradise will begin to collapse. After a short while you will be teleported back to Cloud Ruler Temple. During that time you can loot Mankar's body for his staff and enchanted robe if you want (but you don't need them to complete the quest). When you get back you'll have the Amulet of Kings in your possession (even if you didn't loot it)."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Paranoia","Glarthir will approach you on the street and tell you to meet him behind the Great Chapel of Julianos at midnight. Follow through with the meeting and he'll share his thoughts about a conspiracy against him. Glarthir identifies a conspirator and asks you to observe their movements for a day. Optional: Follow the person that Glarthir has identified. Return to Glarthir the next night with your findings. He will give you 150 gold whether you accuse the target or not. Repeat the process for two other potential conspirators. This time, the rewards will be: If you report that they were not acting suspiciously, he'll give you 150 gold. If you report that the person was indeed spying on him, and had previously done the same for another target, he'll give you 200 gold. After the third report, if you said that they were all innocent, Glarthir will not believe you. He'll attack you and you must kill him. If you said that at least one was guilty, Glarthir will instruct you to kill the accused. You can: Kill the intended targets and receive 1000 gold from Glarthir. Report Glarthir to the authorities and receive 1 Fame. If you accused Davide Surilie: inform him or his brother that Glarthir wants them dead and they will kill him themselves.","A Disturbed Bosmer[edit] Enter Skingrad and you will meet a Wood Elf named Glarthir, who behaves in a disturbed way. He will stop you in the street and ask you to meet him behind the Great Chapel of Julianos at midnight. The Great Chapel is contained within the south walls of Skingrad. Once there, he will explain to you that he believes there is a conspiracy against him. If you don't meet with him immediately, he will keep showing up each night around midnight until you talk to him there. He goes on to identify Bernadette Peneles, who lives right across from his house, as someone who has been assigned to spy on his movements. Glarthir asks you to be outside his house the next morning at 6am and to monitor Bernadette's actions, warning you to not let yourself be seen by her. Glarthir then sets up another meeting with you at midnight the following day and warns you not to make any contact with him in public. If you refuse the initial request to help with Bernadette, the quest will show completed, and he will try to work out problems on his own. He will go to his house and, after about an hour, come out with his battle axe and enter Bernadette's house, and attack her. She may run outside, and the guards will kill him. Alternatively, he may kill her inside her house or the church and exit after about an hour. Follow him and the next guard to meet him will kill him. In either case, you can search his corpse to find his house key, then enter his house to take the 800 gold in the wastebasket. Public Opinion[edit] If you talk to a guard after this, you can ask him to arrest Glarthir (however, they can't do anything until you receive his death note later). You can also tell him about Glarthir's suspicions; the guard will say he's ""getting worse"" and asks you to keep an eye on him. Apparently, his shaky mental condition is well known in the city, and many citizens will comment on how he's ""having one of his bad spells"" lately. You will eventually be approached by Dion, the guard captain, about your interest in Glarthir, regardless of how many times you have met with him. He will warn you not to get involved with him and to report any strange requests to the guards. More Suspects[edit] Meet with Glarthir behind the chapel at midnight. Again, you can wait days or weeks before meeting with him. He will ask you if Bernadette is actually following him. Whether you tell him the truth or lie you will get 150 gold as a reward. If you say that you don't have enough information, he will go back to waiting and showing up behind the chapel each night until you are ready to continue. Glarthir will then ask you to follow Toutius Sextius, whom he also suspects. Again, follow Toutius around if you want to assuage your conscience or curiosity, although it is not required to complete the quest. Report back to Glarthir at midnight, and tell him what you want. If you cleared Bernadette and again clear Toutius, Glarthir will find it hard to believe that neither one is in a conspiracy against him, but he will still reward you with an additional payment of 150 gold. If however you accused Bernadette and again accuse Toutius, Glarthir will be overjoyed that he was right and will reward you with an additional payment of 200 gold. He will now ask you to follow Davide Surilie, whom he thinks is the ringleader in the conspiracy against him. Davide is one of the two brothers who own the Surilie vineyard to the west of town. Again, follow him or not. When you report back to Glarthir at midnight there are two options. If you told him that none of the three are following him, Glarthir will attack you. (Note:Glarthir's iron battle axe is located on the third floor of his house. If you steal this, and then inform him (all three times) that his suspects are not spying on him, he will attack you but will be unarmed.) Otherwise he will give you another payment of 150 gold (if you cleared the other two suspects) or 200 gold (if you accused at least one of the other two suspects) for following Davide, then hand you a note and offer you 1000 gold to kill each of the people you told him were following him. Assassinate the ""Spies""[edit] Glarthir dealing with Davide himself If you refuse to kill them, Glarthir will go and try to kill them himself (same as if you declined him at the beginning of the quest). If you choose to kill them, you will only need to kill the ones you picked as following Glarthir. His note tells you whom to kill, and, if you picked Davide, it will tell you to kill him first, however the order doesn't matter. Davide is fairly easy to kill. He should be asleep in his house right about the time you finish talking to Glarthir. With some sneaking and lock-picking you should be able to kill him in his bed without his brother noticing. The lock on the Surilie brother's balcony is average, making it an easier point of entry. He is sleeping in his house, and as he wakes up from your first strike, he shouts out, landing you a bounty of 40 gold. Guards are on patrol nearby and you'll probably get arrested right outside the door. Toutius likes to hang around alone in a field outside of town during the day. That may be an easier way to bump him off without nearby guards. Bernadette's killing is also rather simple. With only 90 health, a sneak attack while she is sleeping followed by a reasonably powerful Destruction spell should finish her off. Once you have killed everyone you are supposed to, return to the meeting place at midnight to collect your reward (1000 gold) from a very relieved Glarthir. To take the middle road, tell Glarthir that any one of the suspects is watching him. When he hands you the note, take it to a guard. Hand him the note, and follow him to watch him kill Glarthir. Grab his house key and get the 800 gold from the wastebasket. This way you get no bounty, almost as much gold, and 1 fame point. Alternatively, you can pickpocket Glarthir for his house key, steal everything in his house, kill Davide and collect the final 1000 gold as well. If you show Bernadette or Toutius the note telling you to kill them, they will simply ask you to inform the guards. However, if you accuse Davide and show him or his brother Gaston the note, they will attack Glarthir themselves."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Path_of_Dawn","Speak to Jauffre about the Amulet of Kings. Find Baurus in the Imperial City. Help him defeat a Mythic Dawn assassin, which will give you a mysterious book. Track down the rest of the Mythic Dawn Commentaries. Book Two can be found at the Arcane University. Book Three can be found at First Edition. Book Four requires meeting a cultist in the Imperial Sewers, with Baurus. The books give you a location where, in turn, you'll learn where the Mythic Dawn sanctuary is.","Preparation[edit] During this quest, Baurus becomes non-essential, so before going on this quest, it is recommended to obtain some Convalescence spells to assist in keeping him alive. An Old Friend[edit] RemasteredOblivion Cloud Ruler Temple Cloud Ruler Temple Talk to Jauffre after escorting him and Martin to Cloud Ruler Temple. Now that Martin is safe and secure, the next obvious step is to retrieve the Amulet of Kings so that Martin can light the Dragonfires. Anticipating this course of action, Baurus, the only Blade present at the Emperor's assassination to survive, has been gathering intelligence in the Imperial City. The two of you are to work in conjunction to retrieve the Amulet. You can find Baurus at Luther Broad's Boarding House in the Elven Gardens District. Inside, you'll find Baurus sitting down and drinking. One other customer, Astav Wirich, is always present in the corner behind him. Have a seat next to Baurus and chat with him. In the course of his intelligence-gathering, he has attracted unwanted attention and is being stalked. Suspicious of Astav, Baurus formulates a sting operation: He will leave to the secluded basement in the hope the man will follow. Sure enough, as Baurus leaves Astav follows. Head downstairs and intercept him. Volume One: Astav and Baurus[edit] When Astav discovers that he has an opportunity to strike Baurus down without Imperial interference, he'll summon his Mythic Dawn gear and try to assassinate him. Although the fight is pretty one sided in Baurus' favor, Baurus won't mind if you fight Astav from the rear. After Astav is dead, Baurus will instruct you to check his body for anything useful. You'll find a strange book entitled Mythic Dawn Commentaries 1. Show it to Baurus, and he will suggest that you talk to Tar-Meena, an expert of Daedric Cults, in the Arcane University, who may be able to tell you more about the book. Volume Two: The Arcane University[edit] Travel to the Arcane University, located in the southeastern corner of the Imperial City. If you have completed Join the Mages Guild, Tar-Meena will be wandering around the Mystic Archives. If not she will be found reading in the Arch-Mage's Lobby. Talk to her about the Mythic Dawn, and find out more about this cult and its patriarch, Mankar Camoran. She says that you will need the complete set of the Mythic Dawn Commentaries, also known as Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes, to find their headquarters. She offers you the second book, which leaves you to find books three and four. Volume Three: First Edition[edit] RemasteredOblivion Find Phintias at the First Edition Find Phintias at the First Edition Tar-Meena suggests that you visit the First Edition bookstore and speak with Phintias, the proprietor, who may have some information about the last two volumes. His bookstore is in the Market District on the northeast side of the Imperial City, near the center of the district. Upon arriving, ask Phintias about the Mysterium Xarxes. He'll say that while books one and two are rare, books three and four are next to impossible to find. He does happen to have a copy of the third one, but it has already been paid for by another customer, Gwinas. As for book four, he states that he has never even seen a copy of it and has absolutely no idea on where you would find one. To obtain the third book at this point, you have a few options: As soon as Gwinas buys the book, talk to him and tell him that the Mythic Dawn were the ones who murdered the emperor. As soon as he realizes this, he will give you the book and a note about the meeting. If you boost Phintias' disposition above 80, he will reluctantly sell the book to you for 100 gold. You will still need to confront Gwinas for the note. Before Gwinas picks up the book, it can be found in a locked chest behind Phintias' counter. You can steal the book before Gwinas arrives and Phintias will not be able to give it to him. If you talk to Phintias, he will comment that the book has been stolen. Again, you will still need to get the note from Gwinas. Gwinas can also be pickpocketed or killed for the book and/or the note. Volume four can only be obtained from a member of the Mythic Dawn. Gwinas has set up a meeting, of which he'll tell you the time and place, with his sponsor, Raven Camoran. You must go in his place to receive the fourth and final volume. Volume Four: The Sewers[edit] RemasteredOblivion A Mythic Dawn hideout A Mythic Dawn hideout As the quest log suggests, go see Baurus back at the Boarding House before heading out to the meeting and let him know what you've found so far. Accompany him through the rather long walk to the Elven Garden Sewers and proceed inside where you'll encounter a few mud crabs and leveled goblins. There is very little loot throughout the sewers, so a direct route to the meeting place is advised. Rather annoyingly, Baurus remains walking the entire path and will stop walking if you run ahead, and you may find yourself backtracking often to retrieve him. As you follow Baurus through the sewers, periodically heal him to keep him at full strength. Heal him again just before entering the final door to the meeting area. He'll let you know when that is. This will keep him alive through the sewers and, if necessary, throughout the fight. If you do not have a Convalescence spell, waiting will heal both of you at the same time. However, this will not work in the middle of a battle. The fight with the Mythic Dawn agents at the meeting area can be rather difficult, especially if you want to keep Baurus alive. Keeping Baurus alive is recommended because he can be a big help at lower levels, and also during the other battles in the Main Quest. Additionally, if you meet Baurus at the Cloud Ruler Temple after he and you travel through the sewers, he will thank you and give you a free skill increase in Blade, Block, and Heavy Armor. You may also wish to take the lead in order to protect Baurus on the way, since he is no longer essential. If you get too far ahead of him, he'll simply wait for you to come close enough to continue on. Once you reach the meeting area, Baurus suggests that you cover him, although, you can take the lead and have him cover you if you insist. In this path though, he will be discovered and attacked. Whatever happens, he says you must try to get the book and recover the Amulet of Kings. At this point, it is a good idea to rest or apply a Convalescence Spell to Baurus if you have one. Saving your game is also an excellent idea. There are many possible ways to continue from here, including the following: If you take the stairs to the left of the door into the Sunken Sewers, you'll be on an overlooking walkway with a great vantage point, as Baurus mentioned. The Sponsor will enter and talk to Baurus as two more cultists enter from the top. Without stealth options, these cultists will likely discover you. Even if they don't see you, the first cultist will recognize Baurus and attack. You have a moment before the two cultists enter to attack the cultist below in your manner of choosing. This stratagem tilts the fight greatly in your and Baurus' favor. Alternatively, if you have reasonably good Sneak and Marksman skills you can shoot through the gates up above and eliminate both cultists before they even enter the room. You can then hop down and assist Baurus in finishing off Raven Camoran. RemasteredOblivion Meet the Sponsor Meet the Sponsor Ignore Baurus' suggestion of using the vantage point and follow him through the door instead. He will sit at the table, while you should hide in the shadows to the right. The inset wall to the left is also an excellent place to wait. When the first cultist comes in, he stands facing the table with his back to you. If you have enough skill in Sneak you can immediately sneak up behind him and pick his pocket. If you take too long the other cultists will arrive. If you can pickpocket the book and sneak out of the room in Baurus' line of sight, he will shortly break off the meeting and follow you, and the two of you can leave in peace. He may leave even if you don't. You may meet the Sponsor instead. Baurus will hide up on the overlook. Sit down in the chair, and the Sponsor will enter. If you get up or try to talk to him he will yell at you. When the other two agents enter the room, they will see Baurus and attack. If you are quick here, there is an opportunity to pickpocket the book before Baurus enters. This will allow you to leave without having to fight the Mythic Dawn Agents. The opportunity arises after the Sponsor has walked behind you and turned his back on you. You can also pickpocket the key to the Sunken Sewers. Another option for keeping Baurus alive at higher levels is to tell Baurus that ""I'm not ready to go yet"" and then go through either door yourself. If you use a Detect Life spell, at least about 60 feet in range, you can see Raven Camoran through a metal gate on the lower level. He is usually around a corner, behind a wall. To attack him out of line-of-sight, use a ranged spell with an area-of-effect at the ground closest to his feet. He and the other cultists will come out and attack you. You can safely take out all three while Baurus is still waiting outside. When you are finished and have the book, go back out and talk to Baurus, who will go ahead to Cloud Ruler Temple, allowing the quest to proceed. If you proceed to do it this way Baurus will remain essential but the Sunken Sewers Key will not be added to Raven Camoran for you to loot. Another option is to go onto the overlooking bridge and make sure Raven sees you while he is still behind the door. This will make him turn hostile but he will not open the gate so you can take him down with a bow or Destruction spell. The other two attackers will come in but will not be very hard to take out. One will carry a key, allowing you to get the book from behind the gate. If you have raised your Illusion skill to its maximum level, you can cast Command Humanoid on one or more Mythic Dawn agents to increase the odds of Baurus surviving. See the Friendly Fire custom spell for one possible method. Loot Mythic Dawn Commentaries Four from the Sponsor along with a level-dependent ring, a Sunken Sewers Key, a potion, and a scroll. Be sure to thoroughly explore the Mythic Dawn room as well, where there are three crates and three chests, including one boss-level chest that may contain additional enchanted items as well as additional copies of Mythic Dawn Commentaries books one to three. Once you have the book, you will part ways with Baurus, who states that he'll go to Cloud Ruler Temple to help protect Martin. It is possible for Baurus to die while making his way back to the temple. Exit the sewers either the way you came or through the new area unlocked by the Sunken Sewers Key you retrieved from the cultists. You can also return to outside the cult room, take an immediate left into the next room and then exit up a ladder into Fathis Ules' basement. This method involves trespassing, but it's the quickest way to the surface. Cracking the Code[edit] RemasteredOblivion Before... Before... RemasteredOblivion ...and after ...and after The four books each contain a clue as to the location of the cult. Go to Tar-Meena at the Arcane University. She'll think about the puzzle and asks you to get back to her tomorrow afternoon to see if she's made progress. If you wait a day and then ask her about the Mythic Dawn, she will tell you that she is sure that the key to the mystery lies in the first word—or even first letter—of each paragraph in the Commentaries.... Look at the large red letters that begin the paragraphs in the book. Put them all together to read: GREEN EMPEROR WAY WHERE TOWER TOUCHES MIDDAY SUN. Green Emperor Way is the central district of the Imperial City, where the Imperial Palace is located. If you are going strictly by the clue from the books, you should wait until nearly midday. Look to see where the White Gold Tower blocks the sun. Find the point where the tip of the tower touches the middle of the sun. You should be standing right in front of the Tomb of Prince Camarril, where a set of red runes are glowing to reveal the location of the Mythic Dawn shrine. Click to activate the tomb and advance the quest. If you're following the quest marker, there's no need to pay attention to the sun: you can follow the quest marker straight to the Tomb of Prince Camarril, located just south of the gate leading to the Talos Plaza District. You don't even need to talk to Tar-Meena. At any time after obtaining the fourth volume you can go to Green Emperor Way to advance the quest. The runes on the tomb will only glow from 11:48am to 12:30pm. You need to be standing on the south side of the tomb with the palace positioned behind the tomb to see the runes. The runes on the tomb actually glow every day from the very beginning of the game, but it is only possible to activate the tomb during this quest."

Wait for him to go into the water, then go into sneak mode and make sure you are not detected. Find a good spot, and shoot the Rose of Sithis at a part of his body that is sticking out of the water. You can also kill him using the Rose of Sithis while he's sleeping in the barracks, as he is unarmored then, as well. He will die instantly (even though it only counts as assault) and you can return to the sanctuary for your reward. It is very hard to avoid incurring a bounty from this kill, as there is a glitch that will get you 40 bounty even if you shoot him with the Rose undetected. You must kill him in one hit by any means to avoid a bounty. If you really want a challenge, one possible approach is to walk up to Adamus Phillida and inform him to his face what you're there for. This will result in every single guard in the city attempting to kill you. If this doesn't end with your death, it will probably end in a massive bounty. You should not do this unless you're high level and a member of the Thieves Guild. Loot the Finger[edit] Now, loot the finger from his body (along with a bunch of keys to various places) and head for Imperial City. Now enter the Prison District of the Imperial City, and wait for nightfall; just before 3am. There should be no guards in the office. Go into Sneak mode, and enter the Imperial Legion Offices (remember all the keys?). As previously mentioned, there shouldn't be any guards around so late at night, so head to the desk right by the entrance and pick the lock. Place the finger in the desk (by clicking on the desk and, within the inventory window, clicking on the finger; unlike some other quests, the quest item does not automatically get transferred for you). The chest to the left of the desk is known to have good treasures in it, so it would be a good idea to loot it while you are there. Head outside undetected, then head to the sanctuary for your reward and bonus. The reward for this quest is the standard 50-600 gold (level-dependent) reward given for each Dark Brotherhood quest. The bonus is an additional 500 gold."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Peryite","Upon locating the Shrine, you'll notice that Peryite's worshippers are frozen in a sleep-like state. You must be at least level 10 to begin this quest. Speak with the Daedric Prince, who will inform you that their souls are trapped in Oblivion, where you must go and free them. Tell Peryite when you are ready and he will send you to Oblivion, to locate and free the five trapped souls of his followers. When all five souls have been freed, Peryite will open a portal back to Cyrodiil for you. Return and speak with Peryite once more to receive Spell Breaker, an enchanted shield.","Locating the Shrine of Peryite[edit] The frozen worshippers Peryite's Shrine is located on the south bank of the Silverfish River, about where it begins to turn to the north (close to where the R at the start of 'River' is on the paper map). No one will give directions to it, so it must be found. You must be level 10 to begin this quest. There are five worshippers here, but none are moving. If you try to speak to any of them, it appears they are unconscious. Activate the statue, and Peryite will speak to you. His followers have performed a risky magical ritual in an attempt to be closer to him. Now their souls are trapped in Oblivion while their bodies remain here in the physical world. Peryite wants you to go to his realm of Oblivion and rescue the souls of his worshippers from their folly. ""This one moves! A welcome change. So, mortal, you have found my shrine, and you have seen my followers. They are an embarrassment to me. The fools cast a spell in the hopes of summoning me to them. It was prideful and foolish, and it has had its consequences. My followers are trapped between worlds; their bodies here on this plane, their souls in Oblivion. I would have you reunite the bodies and the souls. I will transport you to the plane of Oblivion in which they are trapped. Find their souls. When all are collected, I will return you here. Return to me when you are prepared."" The Task at Hand[edit] The portal back to Cyrodiil Peryite will transport you to the Realm of Peryite when you are ready, and will open a portal back once you have rescued all five souls. The quest itself is a pretty straightforward Oblivion crawl. The layout and terrain appear just like the other Oblivion realms, with the usual foes to face. There is no Sigil Stone here, though. The island is shaped like a doughnut, it is large and circular with no middle to cross. Each soul is near a raging bonfire with no fuel source, but the smoke trails give you pretty good pointers as to where they are. Returning to the Shrine[edit] Recover all five souls, then go back to where you started and use the gateway to return to the shrine in Cyrodiil. Peryite will reward you with Spell Breaker, a heavy armor shield with constant 30% spell reflection. ""You have returned my followers, mortal. The natural order is restored, and for this, I thank you. Perhaps they have learned the folly of attempting to touch a Daedra Prince. Take this, with my blessing. May it bring you order."""

Head to Bruma and go straight to the Mages Guild. The guild hall will be in flames once you enter. Fight your way through the ruins until you find Camilla Lollia. Kill her. Immediately after, J'skar will appear. Talk to him about what happened. Return to the Arcane University to report to Traven.","A Septic Wound[edit] Come back a few days after your last task from Traven and he will offer you another job that he doesn't have time to complete. You are to travel to Bruma and speak to Jeanne Frasoric there. He hasn't heard anything from her in a few days, and while he appreciates a break from her constant messages and questions, he is worried that this behavior isn't like her. Something's Not Quite Right[edit] When you arrive at the Bruma Mages Guild, you will quickly find that Traven's fears were correct. The place is in flaming ruins and overrun with undead. Selena Orania lies dead on the floor near the burning bookcase and Volanaro's lifeless corpse will be found sprawled on the stairs as you fight your way down into the living quarters, apparently slain as he tried to flee. If the undead in the guild hall prove too much for you, run outside and the Bruma Guards will provide some support. If even the guards can't deal with the undead, attract the undead to the Fighters Guild next door. Upstairs, you'll find one necromancer, Camilla Lollia, apparently still looking for someone in the room. Allow her to say her piece then put her down. Once she is dead, you'll be approached by the sole survivor, J'skar, who now appears in a corner of the room. He says he was invisible during the entire massacre (similar to his behavior in the Bruma Recommendation quest) frozen in terror, but claims to have seen everything including the arrival of Mannimarco. J'skar reports that Mannimarco slaughtered everyone—even draining people's souls—and then mentioned something about Echo Cave and destroying the Mages Guild. J'skar also thinks the King of Worms may have seen through his invisibility, stating that just before leaving, Mannimarco looked him in the eye and grinned, although why he was left alive he does not know. The most likely possibility is that the King of Worms wanted J'skar alive in order to tell the Council of Mages about what had transpired.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Purification","Read Lucien's letter to you. Meet him in Fort Farragut. Eliminate everyone in the Sanctuary. Return to Lucien for your reward and your new way to receive contracts.","Of Secret And Shadow[edit] The ""Of Secret And Shadow"" mini-quest directs you to talk to Ocheeva. She tells you that you have received a letter from Lucien. Apparently the Black Hand itself has a task for you. For more details, you need to travel to Lucien's current residence in Fort Farragut, just northeast of Cheydinhal. The letter also warns you that you must not speak to anyone in the Sanctuary about the letter and you should be careful about the residents of the fort. Fort Farragut[edit] The tower is full of undead and traps and may prove somewhat difficult if you aren't prepared. However, you can bypass everything and enter through the secret door. This door is located just outside Fort Farragut, inside a hollowed out tree immediately northwest of the fort's tower. When you find Lucien, he tells you about the assassin among the assassins that you may have already heard about. He tells you that you are not a suspect because you are a new member, but the assassin is definitely in the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. Lucien informs you that you must perform a Purification upon the Sanctuary. This means that you must kill every member of the Dark Brotherhood in Cheydinhal that Lucien names (Schemer and the Dark Guardian are above suspicion for their own reasons). As you have become a Silencer, you are permanently exempt from following the Five Tenets. Elimination[edit] You should have no problem killing the Sanctuary members. Lucien gives you some items which may help you in your mission, and you don't have to fight all the members at the same time. If you are seen killing any of the Sanctuary residents, the people who see you (including the Dark Guardian) will lose 70 disposition points. This may be enough to cause them to attack you. The only people who may give you trouble are Gogron gro-Bolmog, Teinaava, and Vicente. Teinaava and Vicente have good swords and Gogron wears heavy armor and carries an enchanted battle axe. Getting rid of Telaendril may be tricky, as she is absent from the city on Loredas and Sundas. One way to determine her whereabouts is looting Ocheeva's corpse and acquiring Telaendril's note. You can also follow her quest marker on your map. If you don't want to follow her around, you can wait until Middas, when she returns to the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. Alternatively, you can find her near the Mages Guild on Turdas. You can choose an appropriate dialogue option to infuriate her and prompt her to attack you. If you run to any nearby guards, they will take care of her for you, saving you the trouble of fighting and an unnecessary bounty. It is also possible for Telaendril to get killed by bandits while travelling. You can also reverse-pickpocket a poisoned apple into her inventory, which allows you to kill her in public without incurring a bounty (assuming you were not seen pickpocketing her). Introduction to Dead Drops[edit] Once you have killed everyone, return to Lucien. He tells you that you will no longer be receiving your contracts face-to-face but instead from letters in ""dead drops"". Each dead drop location will be revealed to you once you have completed your previous contract. The dead drop will hold your reward and the next contract. Lucien tells you the location of your first dead drop and gives you his horse, Shadowmere. Shadowmere is a very fast and strong horse, and is the only ""quest essential"" horse, meaning that she cannot die. She is extremely helpful for getting to the various dead drops and locations of the upcoming contracts."

Bring the ring back to Lerexus to receive your reward.","Drug Traffickers[edit] Just outside of the Leyawiin west gate you should meet a legion guard called Lerexus Callidus. Apparently, there is a drug trafficking problem, and he will ask you to help him put a stop to it. He tells you about Kylius Lonavo, a ringleader of Skooma dealers in the Greyland settlement. Lerexus firmly believes the only way to end the trafficking problem is to kill Kylius. You are asked to travel to Greyland, kill Kylius and any of his accomplices, and bring back Kylius' ring as proof of his death. Slay the Ringleader[edit] Greyland is a tiny settlement due southwest of Leyawiin. Simply follow up the road from where you met up with Lerexus Callidus. The road leads right up to the house where your victim is currently hiding. Kylius has a companion marauder with him, so make sure you are well prepared before entering. After killing Kylius, make sure to take Kylius Lonavo's Ring from his corpse. Return to Lerexus Callidus for your reward. The reward is a leveled amount of gold, as specified in the table below. An Easier Alternative[edit] Kylius' companion is actually an independent Marauder who respawns every three days in the Greyland house, regardless of the quest status. Clean up Greyland before starting this quest: you will only have to deal with the sole Marauder. Backtrack to Lerexus Callidus and accept the quest, which will trigger the appearance of Kylius. He is much easier to dispatch alone. Pickpocketing the Ring[edit] You can also simply pickpocket Kylius and steal his ring. Lerexus Callidus thanks you and rewards you the same as if you had killed Kylius. Gold Reward[edit] A random amount of gold is given from the range corresponding to your character's level when you report your success to Lerexus Callidus.

Rat Problem?[edit] When you talk to Arvena, you'll learn her ""rat problem"" isn't exactly what you would have thought it to be. Apparently, she loves rats and keeps some as pets. Lately, she has been finding them dead. It is now up to you to find out what's been happening. Head down to the basement where you should find a starving mountain lion attacking the rats. Kill the lion and make sure to do this before it kills all the rats, as that will end the quest. Report back to Arvena and she'll ask you to find Pinarus Inventius, a hunter whose house is just on the other side of the road. Speak to him and follow him outside the city. Kill all four starving mountain lions and go back to Arvena. Maybe Bricks Would Work[edit] When you return to Arvena, you'll learn that there is yet another lion in the basement. Kill that one and go back upstairs. Arvena will tell you that she suspects that her neighbor Quill-Weave is responsible. She says that Quill-Weave has never liked her rats and has been sneaking around Arvena's house at night. If you talk to Quill-Weave, she'll deny any involvement. You're going to have to catch her in the act to make her confess. Quill-Weave will go into sneak mode around 8 p.m. and head for Arvena's house. You can lie in wait for her there or follow her around Anvil till she gets there, if your Sneak skill is high enough. As long as you are out of her line of sight, she drops some meat next to the hole into Arvena's basement, and you'll get a journal entry; talk to her after that and the truth will come out. Quill-Weave says that she didn't mean to lure the lions inside; she was just trying to lure the rats out so that the guards would kill them. You can decide whether to keep her secret or not. RemasteredOblivion Quill-Weave's bait is attracting more than the rats Quill-Weave's bait is attracting more than the rats To Rat or Not to Rat[edit] There are two options for how to finish the quest: Tell Arvena that Quill-Weave had nothing to do with it, and Quill-Weave will give you a free one-level boost in Acrobatics. Tell Arvena that Quill-Weave was behind it, and Arvena will give you a free one-level boost in Speechcraft. Quill-Weave will still be available as an Acrobatics trainer but she'll call you a ""rat"" every time you speak with her, no matter how high her disposition is toward you. Whichever option you choose, Arvena gives you the same level-dependent gold reward and your Fame is increased by one point.

Teinaava will only offer to discuss the topic if his disposition towards you is greater than 70. If you say that you are interested, he will reveal that his fellow Shadowscale, Scar-Tail, fled the Black Marsh, violating code, and refuses to return. Because Shadowscale cannot kill their own kin, as in the Dark Brotherhood, he has contacted you to do the dirty work. You are to bring back the Argonian's heart as proof. Bogwater Camp[edit] Head to Bogwater, a camp southeast of Leyawiin. There, you will see a lone Argonian standing next to the fire. Speak with Scar-Tail and he will tell you of another assassin's attempt on him before you got there. The assassin lies dead next to the tree just west of his camp, yet he injured Scar-Tail greatly. You have three possible options to complete the quest: Kill Scar-Tail and take his heart. Scar-Tail's health is quite low, and therefore he is an easy kill. Find the dead assassin, take his heart (Teinaava can not tell the difference), and spare Scar-Tail's life. Scar-Tail will then tell you where his treasure is hidden. Agree to Scar-Tail's proposition initially, and then after learning the location of his treasure, kill him.

Return all the stolen parts to Bothiel and let her repair the Orrery. Activate the Orrery to receive a greater power as reward.","Stolen Parts for the Orrery[edit] Upon loading the download you will automatically receive a note from Bothiel (a mage at the Arcane University), asking you to recover some missing Dwarven artifacts that are needed to repair the Imperial Orrery. The last known location of the bandits is Camp Ales, to the far west of Cyrodiil. If you start a new game with this download loaded, the note and quest will be given to you when you emerge from the sewers into the daylight at the end of the tutorial level. Collecting the Artifacts[edit] Travel to Camp Ales, where you will find two or more bandits. It is possible you have already been there (the location exists before the download is installed), in which case you can fast-travel. One of the bandits is identified as a male Redguard Bandit Carrier; he is the one that is carrying a Dwarven artifact (specifically a Dwarven Cog) as well as an undelivered letter. The letter lists four other campsites where the other artifacts are hidden. Travel to each of the other camps to kill the Bandit Carrier located there and retrieve his artifact. The specific camps are: Bodean Camp: Dwarven Cylinder, carried by a female Redguard Bandit Carrier Brotch Camp: the second Dwarven Cog, carried by a male Imperial Bandit Carrier Dagny's Camp: Dwarven Coherer, carried by a male Nord Bandit Carrier Varus Camp: Dwarven Tube, carried by a female Imperial Bandit Carrier All four campsites are in the western part of Cyrodiil (in a rough circle centered on Camp Ales), and exist before the download is installed. You can also visit any of these campsites before going to Camp Ales, and you will find the Bandit Carrier and artifact already there. The Bandit Carriers are all equivalent to bandit ringleaders. Therefore, their level is one higher than yours. They can be wearing full suits of light armor, all pieces of which may be enchanted, and they are carrying a blunt weapon that also may be enchanted. The equipment carried by the bandits can be more valuable than the cash reward for the quest itself. The Orrery[edit] Once you have all the pieces, return to the University and talk to Bothiel, who should be waiting in the Arch-Mage's Lobby (you do not need to be a member of the Mages Guild to complete the quest). Bothiel will take all the items from you, and in exchange reward you with a leveled amount of gold. The gold is 100 times your level, up to a maximum of 3000 gold (although Bothiel says ""Here's your reward"", there is no screen update telling you the gold was added to your inventory, so it is easy to overlook this reward. [This appears to have been fixed in Oblivion Remastered]). Bothiel will need a day to repair the Orrery, at which point you will get a quest update telling you the repair is complete (the repair is actually completed at midnight, so if you give the items to Bothiel at 11:59 pm, you may only have to wait a couple minutes for the repair to be done). From that point you can enter the Orrery whenever you wish. The first time you go in, you will have to activate it at the Imperial Orrery Console.

You can get a substantial boost in Acrobatics with the Boots of Springheel Jak, but any Fortify will help. A well-placed area-effect destruction spell (such as Shocking Burst, or even Weak Fireball) can knock the note to the floor. When you have purchased the display case upgrade, jump from the leftmost one (facing the windows) and you can grab the note while falling toward the loft with no acrobatics skill. The note contains a riddle: ""Two bodies have I, though both joined in one. The more I stand still, the quicker I run."" Treasure Hunt[edit] RemasteredOblivion The Old Hourglass The Old Hourglass From reading the note, you get the impression that there is a treasure in an hourglass within the house somewhere. It may be difficult to find as there is no real clue in the note as to where it exactly is, and, if you have bought upgrades there are 2 normal hourglasses in the house in desks, which may confuse you. To find the treasure, go down into the basement, it's embedded in the top of the frame of the wooden pillar with the garlic hanging from it. Activate the ""Old Hourglass."" This completes the quest and you will receive an hourglass, the Ring of the Gray and 6 flawless gems: 2 diamonds, 2 sapphires and 2 emeralds."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Sanguine","Once you have reached level 8, give Sanguine an offering of Cyrodilic Brandy to start the quest. Go to Leyawiin and play a prank at the countess' dinner party using Sanguine's spell. Flee from the guards in Leyawiin (while stark naked). Return to Sanguine to recover your gear and receive your reward: the Sanguine Rose, a staff that summons random Daedra.","Locating the Shrine of Sanguine[edit] The Shrine of Sanguine is roughly northwest of Skingrad and southeast of Fort Dirich at the edge of the treeline. Speaking to Fadus Calidius in Skingrad Fighters Guild or Falanu Hlaalu at All Things Alchemical will reveal the location of the shrine on your map (you must have already read Modern Heretics or have spoken with Ulene Hlervu about ""Cheydinhal"" for the topic to appear). You must be at least level 8 to start this quest. An Offering to the God[edit] At the shrine, Engorm will tell you that you need to give Sanguine some Cyrodilic Brandy for him to grant an audience with you. Cyrodilic Brandy can be stolen from many nobles' houses; it can also be bought at the Main Ingredient or the Gilded Carafe in the Imperial City. Also, Bogrum Gro-Galash in the Lonely Suitor Lodge in Bravil has a chance of having it in stock. Three samples can be found inside the Odiil Farm just outside of Chorrol, one sample is found at Cloud Ruler Temple in Jauffre's room, and one can be found in Baenlin's House. With the preliminaries taken care of, approach Sanguine and offer the brandy. He will say: Ah... another mortal come to beg Sanguine to add a bit of spice to an otherwise drab existence. I would have you perform a service for me. The Castle Leyawiin is a dull, dreary place. The mistress is an especially somber soul, and tomorrow she will hold another excruciating dinner party. I want you to liven it up. Use this spell on the Countess and her guests. I think it will make the party much more interesting. You should probably try to be inconspicuous. Or they might kill you. Oh, and the party is by invitation only. You'll have to find a way in. Have fun! The Task at Hand[edit] There is, in fact, no rush to get to Leyawiin; the dinner party will only get underway whenever you make it there, even if it takes you several weeks. When you go to Castle Leyawiin, you will find that you cannot enter the dining room (located to the right of the main audience hall). At night, the door will be locked; in the morning, a guard will be posted there. The guard confirms that there will be a dinner party, but that it is invitation only. In fact, an invitation is not necessary. While the party is in progress (from 6pm until midnight) the guard will let you in if his disposition is high enough (greater than 70); or if you are wearing ""valuable"" enough equipment (which includes jewelry) or an ""upper class"" outfit. Before proceeding, it is strongly recommended that you save your game. When you cast the Stark Reality spell, things are likely to become somewhat chaotic. The Countess is dining with four others: Britta Invel and her husband Jaras, Termanwe, and Vlarimil Orius. If the Countess (or any guest) isn't immediately there, try waiting 24 hours or so (eventually they will arrive). You will need to cast Stark Reality on all five people for the prank to be considered a success. If you are having trouble with this (see bugs), aiming at Termanwe will reliably affect everyone. When you cast Stark Reality, you will discover that the dinner guests are stripped down to their undergarments and start running around hysterically. The guests aren't the only ones affected: all your possessions, including all of your gold, have vanished (don't panic: you will get everything back at the end of the quest). Casting the spell is considered to be an assault, because the spell has a Drain Health 1 component. The guards posted outside the room will immediately try to arrest you. Since you just lost all your gold, you cannot just pay a fine: you must go to jail or run. Returning to the Shrine of Sanguine[edit] Since you have no gear and no money, you'll probably want to return to the Shrine of Sanguine right away. Not only will you receive your reward, the Sanguine Rose, but Sanguine will also have all of your vanished gear waiting for you in a chest at the Shrine. His parting message is: A rousing success, mortal! And it appears you joined in the festivities as well. Good for you. You need to lighten up a bit. You'll find your equipment in that chest over there. And here's a little something for your efforts. Maybe we'll celebrate again sometime...."

Defeat Corelian and take the Elder Scroll from their corpse. Speak with Ilav for your reward.","The Time Wound[edit] This quest picks up immediately from the previous quest, A Wound In Time. Upon informing Ilav about the magical barrier within Beldaburo, he will cast a blessing on you to allow you to pass through the barrier. He will task you with recovering the Order of the Hour's Elder Scroll before it can be used to open a Time Wound. You must return to Beldaburo and make your way back to the locked door to Beldaburo Anga, the second zone of the dungeon. This time, you will be able to pass through the door as normal. Fight your way through the undead enemies on the other side until you locate the Time Wound, a swirling vortex of light in the center of the final chamber. You will need to defeat Corelian, a nether lich who can be found in the final chamber. Luckily, despite his ghostly apperance you can hit him with any weapon. Annihilate him and you will then be able to loot the lich's body for a key, a diary, and an Elder Scroll. The diary provides some context behind the lich's motives; it outlines Corelian's descent into madness, and their attempt to use the Scroll to travel back in time and warn their past self of the perils of lichdom. To progress the quest, you only need to grab the Elder Scroll. Return the Scroll to Ilav for your reward. He will thank you for restoring the flow of Time and will name you a Paladin of the Hour, completing the quest. You can speak with him at any time to claim the rewards listed below—equipment befitting a Paladin of the Order."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Scheduled_for_Execution","Take the key from Valtieri, and make your way through the sewers. Find Valen Dreth in his cell, and kill him. (Optional) Do not kill any guards. Exit the prison and return to Valtieri.","No Rest for the Wicked[edit] The mini-quest to get the contract from Vicente Valtieri is named ""No Rest for the Wicked"". Vicente will tell you your next target is Valen Dreth. The name may sound familiar—he was the Dark Elf taunting you inside the Imperial Dungeon at the very beginning of the game. Revenge is a dish best served cold. Getting through the Sewers[edit] You return to the Imperial dungeon basically the same way that you got out in the tutorial: through the Imperial Prison Sewer to the northeast of the Imperial City. Valtieri gives you the key, which is necessary because the sewer was sealed shut following your escape. Have a few lockpicks handy as there are a couple gates that do not open with the sewer key. Early on there is a detour through a couple of sewer sections that you did not previously visit, but then you'll proceed through the same Sanctum and Imperial Subterrane as before. If in doubt, follow your map marker. Caution is needed in the Sanctum and in the first part of the Imperial Subterrane: guards have been posted to prevent any more prisoners from escaping. All will attack you on sight. To get the bonus you need to be sure to not kill any of them (Detect Life spells or enchantments are useful). Pause for a minute when you first enter the Sanctum to hear the guards' humorous complaints about this new duty. By keeping to the shadows and waiting patiently for the guards to move along it is possible to sneak past all of them. The most attentive guard is the one when you enter the Imperial Subterrane; he is the only one who is carrying a torch and is more actively patrolling. If you're interested, take a slight detour into the room where the emperor was actually killed. You will find a small shrine to the emperor (including items that can be stolen), a dead Mythic Dawn agent with some notes about the investigation, and the guard leading the investigation, Captain Gepard Montrose. Luckily, the captain is too immersed in his own thoughts to notice an assassin sneaking around right behind him. In fact, it is very possible to pickpocket him and acquire all the keys for the prison, but it is not necessary, because they are easily attainable in the next part of the quest. Assassination[edit] Dreth will be in the same cell as before, across the hall from your former cell. When you first get to the cells, stop and patiently wait for the talkative guard chatting with Valen to leave. If he does not leave, it is possible to shoot Dreth with a bow and arrow from a distance without the guard seeing you. If you pickpocketed Captain Montrose, you already have the key to Dreth's cell. Otherwise, another set of keys are sitting on a small table to the left of the cell. The lock can also be picked. However, once you open his cell be sure to kill him quickly (if possible, with one hit), otherwise he will take off running through the sewers, which leads to a long annoying chase. The other option is to kill him using a bow or destruction magic, or summon an ally on the opposite side of the door; in all of these cases, you do not need to open the cell door. To get back out, you have two options. You can stealthily return through the sewer system. Or, using the Imperial Prison Key, you can go up the stairs and leave through the front door. Once you get into the main prison area you are in a public area; being spotted here won't cause you to be arrested or forfeit your bonus. Payoff[edit] Return to Vicente for a level dependent gold reward (up to 600 gold). If no guards died, you will also receive the bonus Scales of Pitiless Justice, a miscellaneous item that increases your Strength, Agility, and Intelligence attributes by 2 but also reduces your Personality by 2 whenever it is in your inventory."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Secrets_of_the_Ayleids","WARNING: It is recommended that you find and sell all ten Ayleid statues to Umbacano before Stage 60 of this quest. After this point, The Collector cannot be completed successfully. After you return with the carving from the High Fane, Umbacano will give you the next assignment. Receive 1000 gold towards ""persuading"" a rival collector to hand over the crown of the last king of the Ayleids. Proceed to Herminia Cinna's home, and choose whether to steal her crown or retrieve another one. Either way, return to Umbacano with your findings, and he will instruct you to act as his bodyguard at Nenalata. Depending on your actions, you will kill Umbacano and his summoned creatures. After the brawl (or fleeing), make your way out of Nenalata.","Rival Collector[edit] This quest is obtained from Umbacano after returning the carving from the High Fane to him in the Nothing You Can Possess quest. Umbacano tells you that this is a bit different from what he's had you doing before, but still thinks you might succeed where others have failed. A rival collector of Ayleid artifacts has obtained the crown of the last king of the Ayleids, and Umbacano wishes to own it. The collector, Herminia Cinna, refuses to sell it to Umbacano, and he is hoping you can convince her to sell it to you. He gives you 1000 septims to purchase the crown, and tells you that you can keep whatever you do not spend; possibly encouraging you to steal it. The Two Crowns[edit] Go find Herminia Cinna; she lives in the Elven Gardens District. Upon talking to her, you will find that she refuses to sell you the crown. However, she does offer you an alternative. Herminia thinks that Umbacano has an ulterior motive in obtaining the crown. It has some minor magical powers of its own, but she believes it also has control of some other magic that he wishes to possess, and she believes it is for the best if he does not acquire it. Herminia explains that the Ayleid society was not a unified nation, but rather was composed of individual city states. Nenalata was known as the last kingdom simply because it lasted a few hundred years longer than the others, and Herminia thinks that if you brought Umbacano the crown of another Ayleid king, he wouldn't be able to tell them apart. She has already thought about the matter, and wishes you to obtain the royal crown of Lindai. She gives the key to the royal tomb of Lindai and shows you that it is located a bit east of Chorrol. You are now given a choice: steal the crown of Nenalata from Herminia's house, or retrieve the crown of Lindai from the ruins. Steal the crown of Nenalata[edit] Break into Herminia's house, make your way up to her bedroom, and you'll find the crown in an Ayleid cask. You can either pick the lock on the Ayleid cask (Hard lock) or pick the lock on her desk (also a Hard lock) to obtain the key to the Ayleid cask. For spellcasters, there is no difference between the two Hard locks; for lockpickers, the desk is the easier of the two. You may also pickpocket Hermina's house key; it opens the desk, as well as the house. Once you give Umbacano the crown, he will ask you to guard him as he explores the ruins of Nenalata. Pursuing this option will net you better loot, as you can obtain and keep both crowns, but you will not get the ruined crown of Lindai (which can be used to level up your Armorer skill). When you reacquire the Nenalata crown later, it will no longer be tagged as stolen. The crown of Lindai can be retrieved whenever you feel like it, provided that you get the key from Herminia first, rather than just stealing the crown of Nenalata without ever talking to her. You can speak with her and get the key before or after stealing the crown. If you speak to her after stealing it, she will tell you that it is gone and mildly imply that you might have had something to do with the theft. However, raising her disposition above 70, she will still explain about the Lindai crown and give you the key. Acquire the crown of Lindai[edit] Travel to the ruins of Lindai and delve deep into the ruins. Eventually, you'll find the crown near the end of the tombs. The crown itself is light armor with a few useful magical abilities. Return to the Imperial City and give the crown to Umbacano. He'll comment that the markings aren't quite as one of his reference books describes, but he mistakes it for the real artifact anyway. He now has one more task for you, which is the same as the end of the first option: travel to the ruins of Nenalata and act as his bodyguard. The Last City of the Ayleids[edit] Nenalata is located where the Silverfish River meets Niben Bay; a map marker will be added to your map. Even if three days haven't passed (in Oblivion Remastered you do actually need to wait 3 days; if you don’t, there will be a green quest marker but no Umbacano), you should find Umbacano waiting outside along with his other bodyguard, your old friend Claude Maric, if he still lives. If you speak to Claude, he says that he doesn't bear you any ill will and hopes that you hold no hard feelings, either; the incident was just business. Nenalata is populated with particularly powerful enemies for your level, so it may be a good idea to do the fighting yourself, especially at higher levels, or aided solely by Claude Maric. This is chiefly to keep Umbacano from dying, which ends the quest. Simply clear out the dungeon before leading him in or tell him to wait in a safe room before you and Claude fight the enemies. Umbacano asks you to escort him to the throne room, so make your way through the three levels of the ruin, fighting the undead inhabitants. Once you arrive at the final chamber of the last zone, Umbacano will place the carving that you recovered from the High Fane; this will open a secret passage to the throne room. He will then walk up to the throne, talking about how now he can begin to reclaim his ancient birthright, then sit on it and recite a few words of power in the elven tongue. From this point, the outcome will vary depending upon which path you took. The King of Nenalata[edit] The King of Nenalata If he wears the true crown, Umbacano transforms into the King of Nenalata and will become hostile. In addition, six secret passages will raise from  the sides of the room and more undead will be released. Umbacano will also attack you, using his staff or one of his range of shock spells. Kill him and the undead, loot his corpse, and exit the ruins through the side passageway that opens up in throne room. A Tragic Fatality[edit] If he wears the crown of Lindai, the Dark Welkynd stones lining the room will kill Umbacano and destroy the crown of their hated rival. Several secret doors will open, allowing undead to enter the room and attack you. Fleeing here is a real option, even if you have Claude to help you out, especially at higher levels. You cannot run back out the way you came in, so you will have to go up the stairs for the exit. (The staircase is all the way to the north, through the northern room which contained some of the undead--to the left of the throne as you face it.) Once the undead are defeated, loot them, Umbacano, and Claude Maric, if he died. Your old employer is still wearing the crown, now destroyed and not repairable, and has the keys to his house and some level-dependent equipment. Claude also has the usual range of level-dependent equipment. Retrieve what you wish and then leave the ruin."

In order to receive training from J'baana, you must first bring him a message from S'Krivva in Bravil. You can only get to him by going through the back door in the Bastion or waiting until the gates nearby are open. The message has no bearing on the quest, the entire text of it being:  ""3 Prowlers sent to Elsweyr. The item should be acquired within the week. Please have patience."""
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Seeking_Your_Roots","Harvest Nirnroot for the first time to be given a new quest. You should ask an alchemist about it. Question alchemists to get no useful information other than to see Sinderion in Skingrad. Find Sinderion in his cellar at the West Weald Inn in Skingrad. Ask him about Nirnroot, and he'll tell you a story. He tells you to collect a certain number of Nirnroot which you should return to him. He'll tell you to wait 24 hours that so he may finish his research. When he's done, he rewards you with a potion, and you should repeat the process three more times. When you've gone through this a total of four times, he'll have exhausted his research, and from now on he'll just pay in gold for any Nirnroot that you should return to him.","A Word on Nirnroot[edit] Nirnroot is a very noticeable, vibrant, greenish-blue plant with four large leaves, usually located close to water and emitting a quiet ringing noise.  There are hundreds of locations where the plant can be found, but unlike every other plant in the game it does not regrow; each plant can only be harvested once.  As a result, it is considered to be a rare plant.  Details on where the plant can be found are provided on the Nirnroot page. When harvested for the first time, a new quest will be added with the information that the plant is very rare and that you should consult an alchemist about it.  This quest will also be added if you talk to Sinderion (see below).  Ask about Nirnroot.  In the inventory the ingredient is shown to have no value (likely to represent that its value is unknown). Best Botanist in Cyrodiil[edit] When asked, alchemists are stumped by this ingredient and will suggest that you go see Sinderion in Skingrad, who is said to be the best botanist in Cyrodiil. Sinderion can be found in his cellar at the West Weald Inn. When you select the dialogue topic ""Nirnroot"", he will tell you a lengthy story that boils down to a powerful potion called Elixir of Exploration and will mark Shadeleaf Copse on your map, where three sprigs of Nirnroot can be harvested.  He gives you a note describing the plant and its location, and asks you to collect enough plants so that he can make some of the elixirs. Each time you bring him a set of Nirnroot, he devises a new, more powerful elixir that he can make... but only if you can go collect even more Nirnroot plants. Nirnroot Samples[edit] At each of the four stages of this quest you will repeat the following steps: Sinderion will ask you to collect a number of nirnroots (first 10, then 20, 30, 40) so that he may create a variant of the elixir. Once you bring him the desired number of Nirnroot sprigs, select the ""Elixir of Exploration"" dialogue topic for him to take the sprigs.  He tells you to wait for 24 hours to finish his research. When he's done with the research, he will reward you with one bottle of his new elixir and tells you to bring more Nirnroot. An additional bottle of the new elixir is available for purchase from him each time you speak with him. It respawns in his inventory like a usual non-unique item (e.g., arrows). The quest ends after you have brought Sinderion the last 40 (total 100, which is one third of all the plants in Cyrodiil) sprigs of Nirnroot. He says that he has exhausted his research regarding the Elixir of Exploration. But if you find more Nirnroot in your travels, he will be happy to buy it from you (at least 10 samples of Nirnroot each time). Potion Level Nirnroot requested Effects Duration Base Value   Weak 10 Night Eye, Fortify Health 20 300 seconds 55   Moderate 20 Night Eye, Fortify Health, Fatigue 20 300 seconds 80   Strong 30 Night Eye, Fortify Health, Fatigue 20, Fortify Blade, Blunt, Destruction, Restoration, Security, Sneak 5 300 seconds 170   Grand 40 Night Eye, Fortify Health, Fatigue 20, Fortify Blade, Blunt, Destruction, Restoration, Security, Sneak 10 300 seconds 275   --- 10 After the quest is over, you can turn in 10 nirnroots at a time; your only reward is the gold --- 250 Results[edit] Finishing this quest results in Sinderion's disposition skyrocketing to 100, and haggling becomes fairly easy. Your mileage may vary, but it's a good place to off-load collected ingredients and potions that you don't need.  This can be helpful if you're not an alchemist or a user of a lot of potions, especially since the fields around Skingrad are a very ingredient-rich area. Strategy[edit] You need 100 Nirnroots to complete the quest, but there are over 300 in Cyrodiil. Searching on the shores of the major bodies of water will get you to your goal relatively quickly. Searching around the Topal Bay in the Blackwood area, both sides of the Niben Bay and the lower/upper Niben, and Lake Rumare (both the outer and the island shores) will net you more than enough Nirnroots to complete the quest. Simply start on one side of the Bay, work your way up to and around Lake Rumare, and back down to the other side of the Topal Bay. Since Nirnroot Plants do not respawn, it is possible to softlock completion of this quest by using too many of the ingredients for other purposes. If this happens, you can rely on a single sample of harvested Nirnroot in Deepscorn Bastion that respawns every three days—provided you have the Vile Lair official download installed."

Strangely, when the locals spoke to Reynald, he acted quite odd. Sounds like all this might be worth investigating. Go speak to Reynald. Apparently, he is also aware of these rumors.

While none of them have ever heard of a 'Reynald Jemane', they have heard of a local resident named Guilbert Jemane. It doesn't take all that much looking around to find Guilbert, and he's a spitting image of Reynald. So speak to Guilbert, and he'll tell a bit of his family's history, which makes it clear that Reynald and Guilbert are long lost brothers. At this point, Guilbert will leave for Chorrol to be reunited with his brother. Go back to Chorrol yourself, and find Guilbert. He'll ask you to do him another favor..."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:A_Shadow_Over_Hackdirt","Talk to Dar-Ma in Chorrol. Leave and return to Chorrol. A few days later, visit her mother, Seed-Neeus, to learn that she has not returned from a trip to Hackdirt. Explore Hackdirt to discover the town's hidden secret. Rescue Dar-Ma and make sure she returns safely to Chorrol.","Chorrol[edit] To initiate this quest you must first meet Dar-Ma, a young Argonian woman who lives in Chorrol; the following events will not be set in motion until you've chatted with her. Luckily, meeting her is very easy: she is likely to run up to you in the street and introduce herself. You can also try looking for her at Northern Goods and Trade, the store run by her mother Seed-Neeus. After you leave and return to Chorrol at least two days later you will start to hear rumors that Dar-Ma has gone missing; two new topics, ""Dar-Ma"" and ""Missing Daughter,"" will pop up in conversation. Following up on these topics will point you towards Seed-Neeus, who can be found at Northern Goods and Trade. Seed-Neeus explains that Dar-Ma never returned from a delivery she was making to Hackdirt. She suggests talking to Etira Moslin in Hackdirt, or looking for Dar-Ma's horse, Blossom, because Dar-Ma would never ""willingly abandon"" her horse. A map marker will be added for Hackdirt, which is south of Chorrol. Alternatively, you can skip the Chorrol rumor mill and just show up in Hackdirt without actually being given the quest. Getting a room at the inn and napping for a few hours will quickly put you in the middle of the action. Your Warm Welcome in Hackdirt[edit] RemasteredOblivion Moslin's Inn, Dar-Ma's last known whereabouts Moslin's Inn, Dar-Ma's last known whereabouts Hackdirt is a singularly unpleasant place. The town itself is surrounded by burnt-out ruins. Everyone you meet makes it clear that they wish you weren't there. Start asking about Dar-Ma, and almost everyone will tell you they know nothing. If you explore a bit on your own, you'll find proof that the townspeople are lying to you. In one of the burnt-out shells behind (west of the building) Moslin's Dry Goods, you will find the horse, Blossom; confront Etira Moslin about Blossom and she will claim that she owns Blossom. (Even if you don't particularly care about the horse, it's worth your time to find Blossom now so you can locate her quickly when needed later in the quest.) More evidence of Dar-Ma's presence can be found in the inn. The ransacked room upstairs is evidently the room where Dar-Ma had been staying: her diary is still there. Read it to learn more about what happened. The Moslins will again lie to you if confronted with the diary: Vlanhonder Moslin will say she left without her diary. Only one local makes any attempt to be helpful: Jiv Hiriel will tell you that Dar-Ma is in danger and to meet him in his house after dark. Find Jiv's house (southeast of the other houses), and meet him there in the evening to learn that Dar-Ma is being held in the caverns under the town and that she is due to be sacrificed. He gives you a key that opens any of the trapdoors in the town that lead into the caverns. He suggests that the trapdoor in Moslin's Inn is the best entrance to the caverns, since it is closest to where Dar-Ma is being held. He further suggests that rescuing her in the middle of the night will be easiest, since all the villagers will be at the Gathering. There are many possible entrances to the caverns, and you don't need to obtain a key; lockpicking will get you in, too. Every house in town contains a trapdoor, including Jiv's, though Moslin's Inn is the only unlocked building. There are also two trapdoors outside in the burnt-out ruins: one to the north of town and one to the south. If you feel like fully exploring the caverns, any entrance will work. If you just want to rescue Dar-Ma, Moslin's Inn is one good entrance, as is the outside trapdoor near the Inn. Both of these will allow you to avoid the townspeople. The Brethren[edit] As you search for Dar-Ma you will come across many references to the Brethren. Technically, you don't need to figure out the story behind the Brethren to complete this quest, but it helps you to figure out what is really going on in Hackdirt. Evidently, some thirty years earlier, the Legion was sent to Hackdirt and they burned the town to the ground. Although ""Brethren"" will show up as a conversation entry, the locals will be just as unhelpful on that topic as any other. After you confront her about Blossom, Etira becomes a bit chattier and tells you that they will come to visit you soon. And indeed, they do: six half-naked lunatics with giant eyes will attack you. You should be able to find a Hackdirt Key on at least one of them. Another alternative to being ""greeted"" by the Brethren is to talk about the Brethren once and spend the night in the Moslin Inn. When you wake up, you will be attacked by a Brother armed with a club. Another clue you can collect in your early stages of exploring the town is in the chapel. It may look like a standard chapel, except for the Bible of the Deep Ones. It doesn't appear to have anything to do with the sanctioned nine deities, especially since most of it is written in Daedric lettering. (If you explore the chapel early, before the ""Brethren"" topic appears in your conversations, you can freely take the Bible; later, it is considered stealing.) A full exploration of the caverns will lead to encounters with many more Brethren. The Brethren are very aware of your presence: even with good Sneak skill and Chameleon enchantments, they are likely to notice you. Invisibility (or 100% Chameleon) is necessary to Sneak past them safely. Rescuing Dar-Ma[edit] RemasteredOblivion The Hackdirt Caverns The Hackdirt Caverns If you follow Jiv's advice and enter the caverns at Moslin's Inn, a left turn will lead you to Dar-Ma's cell. The key is conveniently located on the stool right next to the cell. Dar-Ma will follow you out of the caverns, but then she insists that she can't leave without her horse, Blossom. The safest option is to escort her to where Blossom is located. It is also possible to ask Dar-Ma to wait, and go retrieve Blossom (which officially requires stealing Blossom in order to ride her); however, Dar-Ma apparently can get impatient and wander back to Chorrol on her own if left alone for too long. (As long as she survives the trip through the forest, you will still get your full reward.) If you are seen in the caverns by the wandering Brethren, you will be attacked on sight. Note that at night the townsfolk will be in the caverns as well, but they will not attack you unless you attack one of them first – they do not seem to mind when Brethren are slaughtered before them. If Dar-Ma's cage is open when the Brethren are attacking, they will attack Dar-Ma and possibly kill her. However, if you drop a weapon near her (there are some in the crate nearby), she will pick it up and defend herself valiantly. After her rescue, she continues to wear the weapon on her around town. All that is left is to return Dar-Ma to Chorrol. The safest and easiest way is to fast travel to North Country Stables once she retrieves Blossom. Because of a bug (see below) she will walk very slowly, although her diary indicates that this may be because Blossom threw a shoe on the way to Hackdirt. If you choose to walk or ride back to Chorrol with her, you need to be sure to stay right near her, because she can get attacked by wild creatures as you travel through the forest. If she dies at this point, you will have failed the quest. Also, during such an attack, it is possible for Dar-Ma to take off for Chorrol on foot, abandoning her beloved Blossom. Once the two of you are safely back to Chorrol, visit Seed-Neeus. She will be very thankful (Disposition=100) and will grant you a free five-point skill boost in Mercantile. Note that if you have Mercantile as a Major skill and are pursuing efficient leveling, you have to take into consideration the 5 point increase awarded by Seed-Neeus. In Oblivion Remastered, if your Mercantile skill is already over 95, this will boost it over 100 as well as contribute towards your next level even if it is a Minor skill. If you return to Hackdirt after rescuing Dar-Ma your reception will be even more hostile than before: many of the townsfolk will attack you on sight and more ""Brethren"" will emerge to join in the fight. If you feel compelled to rid Tamriel of Deep Ones worshippers, you will find that you can kill off most townspeople without a bounty as long as they hit you first. The only townspeople who prefer to run rather than attack are the two Moslins and Jiv; killing them is considered murder."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Sheogorath","Once you have reached level 2, travel to the Shrine of Sheogorath and speak with Ferul Ravel. Acquire one sample of Lettuce, a Lesser Soul Gem, and a spool of Yarn and offer them to the shrine. Travel to Border Watch and set up the plague of Disease and the plague of Famine. Return to Sheogorath after he completes this ""apocalypse"", and receive Wabbajack as your reward.","Locating the Shrine of Sheogorath[edit] Sheogorath's Shrine is located on the border to Elsweyr, halfway between Bravil and Leyawiin. You must find the shrine on your own; no one will tell you where it is. You must be at least level 2 to start this quest. An Offering to the God[edit] Once you reach his shrine, talk to Ferul Ravel. You will be told to supply a head of lettuce, a Lesser Soul Gem, and yarn. All are quite common; lettuce and yarn are commonly found in random house clutter, and both are guaranteed to be in a number of homes in Border Watch. The Lesser Soul Gem might be slightly more tricky to find; several locations in Bravil, such as the local Mages Guild and the nearby magic shop A Warlock's Luck may have them. If the Shivering Isles expansion is installed, many shrines to Sheogorath in the city of New Sheoth will have these offerings. When you have the items, return to the shrine and activate it. Sheogorath (or Haskill, if you are far in the Shivering Isles main quest) will give you the assignment. While Ferul will tell you to wait for the rain to talk with Sheogorath, this is not true. The greeting can be one of the following: If you have never visited the Shivering Isles, or have not yet completed the quest Through the Fringe of Madness:Another mortal dares to summon me, and already I am bored. But enough about me. Let's talk about you.I could turn you into a goat. Or a puddle. Or a bad idea. I could make you eat your own fingers. Or fall in love with a cloud. Perhaps I could make you into something useful. Let's find out. If you have not yet visited Sheogorath in New Sheoth Palace:Does my Champion summon me? Before I've even told you what to do? That's not very Champion-y. Not at all!This is when I should smite you. Give you a serious smiting. Completely smitten. When I tell you to do something, I generally mean it. I suppose there's something I can have you do while you're here, though. A little errand. And a lot of fun. If you have not yet started The Cold Flame of Agnon:A mortal? Wait... a mortal I know. MY mortal. What are you doing here, mortal, when I've given you things to do?This is when I should smite you. Give you a serious smiting. Completely smitten. When I tell you to do something, I generally mean it. I suppose there's something I can have you do while you're here, though. A little errand. And a lot of fun. If you are currently on The Cold Flame of Agnon:You would summon me? Wait... why are YOU summoning me? You've got things to do. Things I told you to do. This makes me frown.This is when I should smite you. Give you a serious smiting. Completely smitten. When I tell you to do something, I generally mean it. I suppose there's something I can have you do while you're here, though. A little errand. And a lot of fun. If you are currently on Ritual of Accession:Mortal! You could have just stopped by to see Me. Would have saved you some lettuce, you know. I believe I'm displeased.This is when I should smite you. Give you a serious smiting. Completely smitten. When I tell you to do something, I generally mean it. I suppose there's something I can have you do while you're here, though. A little errand. And a lot of fun. If you have not yet started Symbols of Office:This hardly seems the time to summon me. Not when Order is busy invading My Realm. Your [sic] mortals are just a hoot. I hate hoots.This is when I should smite you. Give you a serious smiting. Completely smitten. When I tell you to do something, I generally mean it. I suppose there's something I can have you do while you're here, though. A little errand. And a lot of fun. If you have not yet started The Prince of Madness (Haskill):You, of all people, should realize this is an inopportune time to be in Cyrodiil. Perhaps I've misjudged you.Order is at our doorstep, yet you felt it necessary to offer some yarn to... yourself. An interesting choice, to be sure. Time is a strange thing in the Isles, so this may not set us back, and there is a task that needs to be performed. If you have started The Prince of Madness (Haskill):Praying to yourself, my Lord? That's not a good sign. Or perhaps it is. Prince of Madness, and all that.While I believe that you should be attending to your duties, it is, of course, your prerogative to spend time wherever you wish. Your predecessor did have one task He wanted performed, though He never found a mortal suited for the task. The greeting is followed by the quest assignment: If Sheogorath greeted you:There's a little settlement called Border Watch. It's a nice, peaceful place... and dull, dull, dull. You're going to make their lives interesting. They're a superstitious bunch. Everything is an omen or a portent. Let's make one come true. Find their shaman and ask about the K'Sharra prophecy. You are to find a way to make the first two parts of the prophecy come true. I'll take care of the rest, because it's the most fun. Now, run along. If Haskill greeted you:There is a settlement called Border Watch that your predecessor found rather dull. This, of course, offended Him greatly. They are a rather superstitious group, living their lives based on omens and prophecy. One such prophecy, the K'sharra, was of particular interest. Your task would be to make the first two signs of the prophecy occur. Your predecessor already put plans in motion for the final step. Good luck. The Task at Hand[edit] RemasteredOblivion The rare cheese collection, with Olroy Cheese on the left The rare cheese collection, with Olroy Cheese on the left Once in town, ask about ""K'sharra Prophecy"" to be referred to the village shaman, Ri'Bassa. Once you find him, tell him that you are a ""traveling scholar."" If his Disposition is at least 60 he will tell you about the ""Three Signs"" of the prophecy. The first sign(Oblivion Remastered) To bring the rats, take the wedge of Olroy Cheese from a display box in the Border Watch Inn. The case has a very hard lock, and is located in plain sight. Good Sneak and Security skills can be helpful but are not required. If your skills are low, going to the inn early in the morning when no one else is around and jumping into the corner between the two cases will help to avoid detection, even by S'thasa. Alternatively, you could pickpocket or kill S'thasa and then take the key from her. Or as a final alternative, a strong Charm spell will get you off the hook, even if you are noticed. Place the cheese in the cooking pot outside of the inn, and wait a bit. Once you've placed the cheese in the pot, the rats will appear from the east side of town. After the rats have come, Ri'Bassa will run around placing Rat Poison on the ground for them. After the rats die, take the Rat Poison and head over to the sheep pen, just south of the Inn. Sprinkle the rat poison in the feed trough and the sheep will eat it. Then stand back and watch as they succumb to the poison's effects. You don't need to use the poison on the sheep; using your weapon of choice will work just as well. If you killed the sheep earlier, just wait around a while after putting the Rat Poison in their feed trough and it'll give you the confirmation that you did complete the second phase. The second sign(Oblivion Remastered) Returning to the Shrine[edit] RemasteredOblivion The final part of the prophecy The final part of the prophecy Once you have completed the first two prophecies, Sheogorath (or Haskill) will contact you and inform you to head to the center of Border Watch immediately. Once you do this, the Daedric Prince will perform the third and final part of the prophecy. Once it ends, return to the shrine to receive the Wabbajack, a magical artifact that will transmute any creature (non-NPC) into another random creature for 10 seconds. Once the first two prophecies have been fulfilled, Sheogorath says: If Sheogorath is talking to you:You've done well, mortal. I'm amused, I think. Head into the center of Border Watch. And make sure to duck. If Haskill is talking to you, but you have not started The Prince of Madness:Ah, very good. Your predecessor left everything in place for the final sign. You'll want to head to the center of town. Good day. If you have started The Prince of Madness:Ah, very good, Sire. your [sic] predecessor left everything in place for the final sign. You'll want to head to the center of town. Good day. When you return to the shrine to complete the quest: If you have never visited the Shivering Isles, or have not yet completed the quest Through the Fringe of Madness:Good times. Good times. I hope you had as much fun as I did. Here, take this. It's a fun little toy. Now, go away. Before I kill you. If you have not yet started Symbols of Office:Good work. Good times! Here's a little reward for your efforts. One of my toys. Now, back to business. Before I forget myself. If you have not yet started The Prince of Madness (Haskill):Well done. You should have this, one of the artifacts of the Realm. Perhaps it should have been given to you sooner. If you have started The Prince of Madness (Haskill):Well done, My Lord. You should have this, as it is one of your artifacts. I don't know why I didn't think to give it to you sooner."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Sins_of_the_Father","Talk to Fathis Ules at the Oak and Crosier Inn in Chorrol. Go to the Redguard Valley Cave. Defeat the ogres and take the Honorblade of Chorrol. Return the blade to Laythe Wavrick or sell it to Fathis Ules.","Talking to Fathis Ules[edit] Approximately two days after helping the Jemane brothers in Legacy Lost you will be contacted by a Dunmer thief named Fathis Ules. You need to be in Chorrol for the quest to be initiated. Fathis explains that the Jemane brothers' father, Albert Jemane, once worked for him as a professional thief. He was a good employee for many years, but his greed overcame him and he disappeared with the last object he was told to steal. Fathis thinks that this object (he won't tell you what it is) has been taken by the ogres that until recently had overrun the farm. He shows you how to get to their cave. Raiding the Ogres[edit] Go to the Redguard Valley Cave, which has been overtaken by Redguard Valley Ogres. You need to locate and kill the Ogre Chieftain; you can either kill or avoid the rest of the ogres in the cave. On the corpse of the Ogre Chieftain you will find the Honorblade of Chorrol, the item Ules wants. Your diary suggests to you that perhaps the blade should instead be returned to Castle Chorrol. You can decide which option to take: Keep the sword for yourself (which prevents the quest from being finished, or the quest item flag on the sword being cleared; see below for a post-quest theft solution). Give the blade back to the people of Chorrol. Find Laythe Wavrick, Herald to the Countess of Chorrol in the castle. He thanks you profusely and gives you the Escutcheon of Chorrol in return. Sell it to Fathis Ules for 1500 gold. Closing the Quest[edit] To completely finish the quest, you need to return to Weatherleah and talk to the brothers one last time. The brothers' reaction will depend upon what you did with the sword. If you gave it back to the people, the brothers admit that their father was the original thief. To make amends for their father's actions, they will give you four grand soul gems (all filled with common souls). Their dispositions towards you increase by 20 points, and you gain one Fame point for completing the quest. If you sell the sword to Fathis, the brothers refuse to believe that their father was a thief, and resent your accusations. Their dispositions towards you decrease by 30 points, and you gain one Infamy point for completing the quest. After completing this quest, the Jemanes will have cleaned up Weatherleah, furnishing the interior and planting a garden out front. Reynald will also be noticeably more sober, and will speak as clearly and coherently as his brother."

Head to The Flowing Bowl and wait for a woman to approach with a tempting offer. Go to Gweden Farm at the pre-arranged time. Confront the gang about their activities, and kill them all. Receive your reward from either Maelona or Gogan.","Gang Problems[edit] You may hear from some residents in Anvil about an all-female gang of thieves who pick only on married men. They lure them in with their charms and then rob them. You will be pointed in the direction of Gogan, who lives in Gogan's House at the west end of Anvil. At his house, you will find both Gogan and his wife, Maelona, who tell you that Gogan was tricked by the thieves and that they stole his wife's ring, which was a family heirloom. They will both ask you to help them, and suggest that you start at The Flowing Bowl, which is where Gogan was approached. Approach the Gang[edit] Head off to The Flowing Bowl down by the docks and wait. Two women (Signy Home-Wrecker and Faustina Cartia) enter The Flowing Bowl and approach you. If you are male, they seductively invite you to have a ""night of fun"" at their farmhouse just outside of town; if you are female, they invite you to join their gang. You are told to meet them after 11pm at Gweden Farm, which is now marked on your map. Note: due to a bug, you may become locked in the farmhouse with no means of escaping. Thus it is advisable to save before entering the farmhouse if playing on a console. When you arrive at the farm Faustina will be inside. Do not immediately attack her; you must first talk to her. She asks you either to take off all your clothes and weapons if you're male or, if you're female, to confirm that you want to join their gang. Refuse to do so and tell her that you know what she's up to. The Jig Is Up[edit] Gogan and Maelona After you say this, Signy and Tsarrina appear. Normally all three attack you, and force you to kill them. If you have previously increased Signy's or Faustina's Disposition toward you, however, they may not attack. In this case, you still need to kill them to complete the quest, but initiating combat will cause their deaths to be counted as murder. To avoid this, simply talk to them, which should lower their disposition toward you. After you kill your attackers, Gogan and Maelona come in through the door, dressed in City Watch armor. They explain to you that they work for the City Watch and that they needed a stranger like you to help foil the thieves. They thank you and reward you with a level-dependent amount of gold (see chart below). Before leaving the farmhouse, be sure to search and loot the sirens' corpses (after you leave the main room of the farmhouse, their corpses will all disappear). On Faustina's corpse you will find the Witsplinter, a leveled enchanted dagger, and the Gweden Basement Key. The key provides access to the basement, where you will find a stash of all the things they stole from the married men in town. It is not possible to return these items to their original owners, as there are no additional related dialogue options, so you are free to keep the items for your own use. After Gogan and Maelona have left the farmhouse the front door is permanently locked, so be sure to take everything you want with you before leaving.

Once Erthor is located, kill all the zombies and return to Adrienne with him for your recommendation.","Skingrad Mages Guild[edit] When you arrive in Skingrad, you may overhear citizens and guild members talking about a strange, but relieving disappearance: ""I hear one of the guild mages has gone missing again."", ""Have you seen Erthor around town lately?"", ""It seems quieter than usual at the Mages Guild."", ""Is it me, or is it quieter around here with Erthor missing?"" and ""Any sign of Erthor lately?"" However, when you ask the distracted guild head Adrienne Berene for a recommendation she will say: ""My research occupies nearly all of my time. Now that I think about it, I do have a small problem concerning Erthor. He's one of the guild mages here. Think you can do something about it?"" If you accept, she will continue: ""Excellent. I just don't have the time to search for him again, but I do need to consult him about some notes he borrowed. You might want to ask around, and see if anyone can be of some help. Let me know when he's back, and you'll have your recommendation."" When asked about Erthor she will hesitantly admit: ""He's... well, he's an interesting fellow. Sulinus Vassinus can tell you more about him, if you wish to know."" She will send you on your way with: ""Have Erthor see me when he gets back, Associate."" She will ask you to help with finding some notes she lent to Erthor. She suggests speaking to the other mages in the guild, as they may have some idea where he is. When you ask around in the guildhall, the other members will be willing to discuss the infamous Erthor. Sulinus Vassinus will provide the full story: ""A nice enough guy, I suppose, but there was that awful scamp incident last year. That's when Adrienne told him he needed to practice somewhere else. ""Somewhere else"" meaning somewhere far away. So he settled down in Bleak Flats cave. Did all of his work there, and came back to town twice a week to check in. Hasn't been around lately, though."" Vigge the Cautious will concur about Bleak Flats Cave: ""He hasn't shown up here in a while. I assumed he was still out at Bleak Flats Cave, where he usually stays."" Druja will also comment on Erthor: ""I haven't seen him in quite some time. But then, this isn't the first time he's been away, so I wasn't really that concerned."" After marking the cave on your map, Druja will finish with: ""Good luck finding Erthor."" The four residing members will then start to have private conversations about their missing guildmate: ""Where's Erthor? I haven't seen him lately."" ""He's probably still out at the cave. Adrienne hasn't let him work here in a long time."" ""I know, but he usually stops by once a week or so. I don't recall seeing him lately."" Speak to any of the other mages about Erthor. They haven't seen him in a while but he is usually out in Bleak Flats Cave, west of Skingrad. Druja in particular can give you a more detailed location - northwest of Skingrad - and mark the location on your map. Druja suggests you remind Adrienne of this location. A Terrible Guild Master[edit] Speak with Adrienne and remind her about Bleak Flats Cave. She will send you to the cave to fetch Erthor, giving you a Weak Fireball spell for assistance. The cave is relatively small; besides Erthor there are only seven Deranged Zombies present. These are leveled zombies that drop a unique form of bonemeal instead of mort flesh. You will have to clear out the cave in order to get Erthor to leave and follow you back to Skingrad.

They will direct you to the master, Marana Rian. Marana will ask you to steal a special coin from her as a requirement for further training. It's quite easy if you're good at sneaking (which you must be in order to receive master training); the coin is in her pocket.

There are nineteen of them, five in the Imperial City, and two each in the other major cities, as listed below. All you need to do is start a dialogue with each of the beggars. There will be no acknowledgment given when you have spoken to all of them; simply return to Tandilwe for training. If you have previously spoken with any beggars (for example, many Thieves Guild quests are facilitated by talking to beggars), then those earlier conversations will count towards this quest. If you can remember the beggars with whom you have already spoken, you do not need to talk with them again. Be aware that you may not kill any beggars while this quest is active. This restriction includes casting Frenzy spells on the beggars so that they attack the guards, effectively causing them to commit suicide (you will not acquire a bounty for doing so but Tandilwe will blame you for the death in any case).

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Spies","Ask around about possible ""spies."" Kill the two spies (Jearl and Saveri Faram). Search Jearl's basement and recover the enemy plans. Return to Cloud Ruler Temple with the information.","Investigate Spies[edit] Once you've given the Mysterium Xarxes to Martin, he tells you to speak to Jauffre about 'spies'. Apparently the gate guards have seen strangers along the road near the temple for the past few nights and Jauffre wants you to find them. Speak to Captain Steffan for more details. Steffan says the spies have been seen near the rune stone at the bottom of the hill near dusk. The Rune Stone[edit] There are two Mythic Dawn agents to find and eliminate to complete this quest: Saveri Faram and Jearl. Note that even though it is possible to pickpocket the basement key from Jearl as she leaves her house and obtain proof that Jearl is a spy, you will still be forced to kill the spies. The pointer will point back to Jauffre at Cloud Ruler Temple as soon as you obtain the proof, but he will instruct you to kill them anyway (see stage 85). The first can most often be found at the Hestra Rune Stone indicated by Steffan, just southeast of the temple towards Bruma. At sunset (shortly after 5pm, to be specific), one or both Mythic Dawn agents will appear in the ruins and attack you on sight. The rune stone's Bound Gauntlets and Bound Weapon (dagger or mace) may be useful in the fight. If you need help, you can lead the agents to either the town or the temple and have the guards help you kill them. You can also go directly into Jearl's house in Bruma during the day and pick the lock, in which case both spies will be inside. The spies will also set off from Jearl's house around 4pm and will attack you on sight if they see you in the city. Once the first Mythic Dawn agent is dead, you will receive a quest message to speak to Captain Burd in Bruma, as Jauffre previously mentioned. Make sure you loot all keys from the first agent's corpse. If you kill both agents before talking to Captain Burd and then talk to Jauffre, he will direct you to locate their base, so you will still need to talk to Captain Burd to continue. Jearl's Basement[edit] The first agent has two keys on her which should help you find the cultists' base in Bruma. You can head directly to Jearl's house or seek further guidance from Captain Burd. He might be found patrolling the Great Hall in Bruma. Ask him about 'spies in town' and he doesn't have any specific information. Tell him what you've found so far. If you killed the cultist at the rune stone he'll allow you to search Jearl's home, otherwise he'll mention the Bruma Caverns are being used by the spies. Jearl's house is in the southern part of Bruma and is easily entered with the key you retrieved from her. There's nothing much to be found on the first floor. The one locked chest just has a 75% chance of containing one piece of armor (fur or leather) or one weapon (iron or steel). However, there is a concealed trapdoor that is partially hidden by the green rug closest to the bed. Alternatively, you can go through the Bruma Caverns found just west of town. Either way, you'll end up in Jearl's basement (both entrances locked, level dependent, opened with the Basement Key from either spy). On a table you find Jearl's Orders, which reveal the enemy's plans. Apparently she and Saveri were casing the Cloud Ruler Temple in preparation for an all-out attack on it and Bruma through the use of Oblivion Gates. The basement doesn't contain anything else of interest except volumes one and two of the Mythic Dawn Commentaries. The second agent will likely attack you on your way to Jearl's basement. If you're having trouble finding the second agent, Saveri Faram or Jearl can be found at the house only at specific times. They can be found sleeping in her bed during the night, but otherwise may be found in the basement, caverns, or woods between Bruma and the Cloud Ruler Temple. Be ready, as the remaining agent will likely attack on sight. If you report back to Captain Burd, he will allow you to enter Jearl's house at any time. For all practical purposes, this means that the house becomes yours. Be aware, however, that only the chest on the ground floor is safe for storage. Return to Cloud Ruler Temple[edit] Return with the plans to Jauffre who will congratulate you on your efforts and then run off to warn the Countess of Bruma about the impending attack. Speak to Martin to learn what he has discovered from the Mysterium Xarxes so far."

Return the Stone to Cirroc and he will reward you with three Strong Potions of Healing. Report back to Azzan for payment and he will inform you that he has no more contracts for you.","Demotion and Assignment[edit] Speak to Azzan in Anvil. He will tell you that Modryn Oreyn has been kicked out of the Guild as a result of Viranus Donton's death at Forsaken Mine. If you have not yet completed Burz's last two quests, Azzan will also inform you that you have been demoted to Defender for your part in the affair. If asked, he will tell you that you may be able to regain your former rank if you complete ""a few contracts"" first. With that out of the way, Azzan will brief you on your next mission. The Stone of St. Alessia has been stolen from the Chapel of Talos in Bruma and you must recover it. Report to Cirroc at the chapel for further information. Pursuit[edit] When you find Cirroc, he will tell you the Stone was stolen by some bandits who were last seen heading to the east, and urges you go after them. Your compass will lead you to the bandit K'Sharr, who is loitering on a slope halfway between Wildeye Stables and Plundered Mine. He will tell you that he and his cronies stole the Stone, but were ambushed by ogres. They stole the Stone in turn, leaving him as the only survivor. He believes the ogres are now at Sedor, an Ayleid ruin along the unmarked road between Bruma and the Temple of the Ancestor Moths, and will mark its location on your map. You may kill K'Sharr at this point if you wish: you will not receive a bounty or gain any Infamy for doing so, although killing him can start the Dark Brotherhood questline. Recovery[edit] Make your way to Sedor and enter the ruin. There are seven ogres inside, but you won't need to fight them all to recover the Stone; see the place page for full walkthrough info. Upon entering you will need to fight at least one, with another possibly being attracted from the southernmost room. In the next room you will face another ogre and again another who may be alerted to the fighting while wandering in the corridor to the east. An iron gate (C) to the north blocks the way, so instead step onto the nearby pressure plate, which opens an unseen gate (D). Head west and turn north and then north again. Head up some stairs, battling past another ogre, until you reach a stone ledge. Press the push block nearby and jump down. The way is now open, so head into the northern room to recover the Stone, which is actually an amulet. With a very high Acrobatics skill and good timing, it is possible to skip most of the exploration by jumping up from near the pressure plate and to push the block from the apex of the jump. Reward[edit] Having recovered the Stone, return it to Cirroc, who will express his gratitude and give you what he can - three Strong Potions of Healing. Report back to Azzan to receive the standard level-dependent gold reward and one Fame point. He will also inform you that he has no more assignments for you. There are several options at this point regarding promotions and your next quest: If this is the first Fighters Guild quest you have completed since Trolls of Forsaken Mine, no promotions are available and you will need to go to Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal for your next quest - The Noble's Daughter. If you have completed The Noble's Daughter already (but not Mystery at Harlun's Watch), Azzan will now be willing to reinstate you to your previous rank of Guardian. Your next quest will be Mystery at Harlun's Watch. If you have already completed both of Burz' quests (The Noble's Daughter and Mystery at Harlun's Watch), you can now be promoted to the rank of Champion (Oreyn's previous title). Your next quest will come from Modryn Oreyn, in his house in Chorrol: Information Gathering."

Find Slythe at the end of the cavern. Get the last diary entry. Either flee from the cavern or defeat the Sunken One. Collect the offering if you so choose.","Empty Farmhouse[edit] Go to Shetcombe Farm, which is close to Kvatch's eastern side (just below the 'h' in Kvatch on the map), north of the road from Skingrad to Kvatch. Enter the farmhouse to find that it is empty. Search the farmhouse, and in (or under) a bowl on the table you'll find the first page of a diary in which Slythe Seringi describes the burning of Kvatch. He believes it is because his god, the Sunken One, is angry at mankind. He decides to go on a pilgrimage to the Sandstone Cavern in order to make an offering. Sandstone Cavern[edit] Head into Sandstone Cavern and search for Slythe. Work your way to the end of the first cave to find the second page of Seringi's diary on top of a chest in a ravine. (The page is on the center of the lid; it is quite small and nearly the same color as the chest.) Things have not gone well for him, and he has almost died several times. Continue through the wooden gate and proceed to the end of the cave to find the lifeless body of Slythe Seringi. Search his body to find the third page of his diary and end the quest. Feel free to take the offering which consists of some cheap gems and a small amount of gold. After you've found the third page of his diary, the Sunken One, a special leveled variety of Storm Atronach, appears. Flee or defeat the Sunken One to leave the cavern."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Taking_Care_of_Lex","After fencing at least 500 gold in stolen items, meet with S'Krivva to receive this mission. Travel to Anvil and steal the recommendation letter. Have a new recommendation letter forged. Sneak into the Imperial Legion Offices to seal the letter with the official seal. Deliver the letter to Countess Millona Umbranox. Take the ""Transfer Orders"" to Hieronymus Lex. Return to S'Krivva for your reward.","S'Krivva[edit] Talk to S'Krivva in Bravil. She tells you that Hieronymus Lex is causing problems and that the Gray Fox would like him reassigned so that he can protect Countess Umbranox of Anvil instead of persecuting the Thieves Guild. She also explains that for some unknown reason the Gray Fox recently put the Countess under his personal protection. Anvil is in need of a new Captain of the Guard; your job is to replace the list of recommended candidates in Steward Dairihill's desk in Castle Anvil with a forged one that recommends Lex. Recommendation Letter[edit] Travel to Anvil and speak with a beggar to learn that Dairihill's desk is in the private quarters of the castle and to get some ideas on how to infiltrate it. The beggar will suggest talking to the blacksmith. Orrin, the blacksmith at the castle's smithy who turns out to be a guild member, will show you a secret passage that will get you into the castle's private quarters. When you get to the end of the passageway, be cautious, as there is a guard that frequently patrols this area at all times of the day and night, and Dairihill is also often found walking about. Wait till after 1am and Dairihill will be out of the room. To open the hidden door at the end of the passage, there is a white pillar to the left of the door. Additionally, an Anvil guard mentions that Dairihill dines between 8pm and midnight, which also keeps her out of your hair. Sneak to Dairihill's desk, which is in a locked room to the left and steal the letter, then return through the secret passage. A Stranger[edit] Ask a beggar again for directions to a forger known only as ""A Stranger"" who lives in an Abandoned House near the Anvil Mages Guild Hall. The Stranger tends to wander, so use the map compass, as it is less ambiguous. Once you locate the Stranger he will agree to forge a new letter for you, but you'll need to wait a day. He spends part of his day in the Castle Anvil audience chamber, and he will not want to speak about forgery while he is there. It won't even be available as a topic. Instead, try to meet him later in the evening at his home. When a day has passed go back to the Stranger and pay him 500 gold to get the new letter. Seal[edit] Next, head to the Imperial City and break into the Imperial Legion Offices located in the Prison District. There are several ways to get into the office you want (directly from outside, from the dining hall (the leftmost door labeled 'Imperial Legion Office'), or from the basement, accessible from the dining hall). The seal for the letter is on top of the desk (just activate it to proceed), although it can be knocked off and be somewhat tricky to find. The chest next to the desk contains some high-quality random loot depending on your level (as much as one enchanted weapon, two unenchanted weapons, one enchanted armor, and two unenchanted armor). These items will be marked as stolen, and fencing them is likely to satisfy any further need to do Independent Thievery. Countess Umbranox[edit] Once the letter is sealed, deliver it to Countess Millona Umbranox in Anvil. She'll decide Hieronymus Lex is the man for the job and ask you to deliver the good news to him. She also mentions you can collect your courier's tip (20 gold) from Dairihill (who will not be very happy). Hieronymus Lex[edit] Deliver the ""Transfer Orders"" to Lex, who can be found stopping for lunch at the South Watch Tower in the Temple District around noon, or in the evening around 7pm at The Bloated Float in the Waterfront. After assuring you he knows who's behind this, he resigns himself to the position and makes his way to Anvil, where he puts on the town guard armor and starts his rounds. Reward[edit] Finally, return to S'Krivva for your 1000 gold reward (500 plus your cost for the forgery) and advancement to Shadowfoot rank. You'll also have Orrin the blacksmith available as a new fence. S'Krivva will have no more jobs for you but mentions the Gray Fox himself may contact you soon."

Go to the Imperial City and talk to Julienne Fanis at the Arcane University. Find the First Edition bookshop in the Imperial City Market District and purchase Knightfall. Learn more on Garridan's Tears by reading Knightfall. Revisit Julienne Fanis and buy some Refined Frost Salts. (Optional) Go back to S'drassa and receive some Philters of Frostward to protect you from severe frost within Frostfire Glade. Travel to the Frostfire Glade cave. Use the Refined Frost Salts to open the sealed door at the back of the Frostfire Glade cave. Search the central area of Frostfire Glade for Garridan's Tears. Return to S'drassa to collect your reward.","S'drassa[edit] A Khajiit named S'drassa at the Leyawiin Mages Guild wants you to bring him rare magical crystals known as Garridan's Tears. He usually jumps at the topic if you agree to hear his story in a little more detail when you speak to him for the first time. Seeking Clues[edit] You will need a sample of Refined Frost Salts Frostfire Cave S'drassa suggests that you begin your search by seeking out and asking Julienne Fanis at the Arcane University about the tears. For the duration of this quest, she will relocate from the Lustratorium, the university's Alchemy center, and can instead be found in the Arch-Mage's lobby all day. In conversation, apart from offering to tell the tale of Garridan himself, Julienne mentions a book called Knightfall she once read, which she believes may be able to give you further evidence on the subject. You should find a copy at the First Edition bookshop in the Market District of the Imperial City. After reading Knightfall, you learn about Frostfire Glade—a frozen, unbearably cold area—which is where the tears are. The glade is entered by opening a magically sealed door at the back of the Frostfire Glade cave. In order to open it, you must have Refined Frost Salts. Go back to Julienne Fanis, and speak to her about what you have learned. Fortunately, she stocks a few samples of her own self-made Refined Frost Salts, which you can purchase from her. At least one sample is needed to access Frostfire Glade during this quest. If you are a member of the Mages Guild with access to the Arcane University, it is also possible to find one sample of Refined Frost Salts on a table in the back of the Lustratorium. However, taking this sample counts as stealing (which will get you suspended from the Mages Guild if you are caught). The stolen sample is otherwise identical to a purchased sample, and will allow you to continue the quest. Final Preparations[edit] This step is optional. After you've finished your business in the Imperial City, travel back to the Leyawiin Mages Guild and find S'drassa. Talk to him about what you have read in the book and, perceiving the danger you are exposing yourself to, S'drassa will offer you, free of charge, Philters of Frostward—5 immensely powerful Resist Frost potions—to protect you from severe cold within Frostfire Glade or to earn you a good deal of money, should you choose to sell them instead.  Frostfire Glade[edit] Frostfire Glade Make your way to the Frostfire Glade cave, which is northeast of the Imperial City or southeast of Bruma. A map marker showing the exact location of the cave will be added to your map as soon as you read Knightfall. The cave is like a passage between the outer world and the actual glade. Claw your way through a few wild animals to a secret door. Use the Refined Frost Salts to unlock it and enter Frostfire Glade. The glade is guarded by a single leveled Frostfire Atronach Glade Guardian who won't hesitate to pick a fight (you can stand on the rock in the center and shoot him without him attacking). As with all frost atronachs, he is immune to frost and poison but weak to fire; be cautious with spells because he has a 15% chance to reflect spells. Garridan's Tears[edit] After the guardian is slain, proceed to the center of the glade and search the misty area for Garridan's Tears. The icy mist inflicts Frost Damage each second that the player remains within its reach, as you would expect from reading the book Knightfall. Use the 5 bottles of Philters of Frostward that S'drassa gave you or any other spell, potion, or enchantment that provides Resist Frost or Frost Shield protection. Alternatively, use a telekinesis spell to move the tears out of the danger area before picking them up or use Spell Absorption to offer a chance at avoiding the spell. You can also simply use healing spells once you've dealt with the atronach, assuming that you have the magicka and a strong enough healing spell (Heal Major Wounds should be enough). The locations of all five tears are indicated on the above map with green dots. Note that one of the five tears is actually located on the elevated stone in the middle, hidden under snow. It can sometimes fall in between the nearby rocks. To locate the tears more easily, aim at the ground until you see the cursor showing the hand symbol. Using Night-Eye can aid in finding the hard-to-spot tears, by changing the contrast so that the tears no longer blend in with the ice and snow. Lighting a torch or casting a Light spell may also help by reflecting light off of the tears, making them more easily distinguishable. Reward[edit] RemasteredOblivion Tears in the display case Tears in the display case Return to S'drassa for a leveled gold reward (see chart) as soon as you're done. The reward is determined by your level when the tears were collected, not your level when you talk to S'drassa; if you level up in the time between collecting the tears and talking to S'drassa, you will not receive any additional gold.

Equip the amulet, and go to sleep. Enter Henantier's Dreamworld; after Henantier speaks to you, find his patience, perception, courage, and resolve. Pass all four tests, and you are returned to Henantier. You and Henantier are transported back to the real world. Henantier gives you six scrolls as a reward.","A Missing Friend[edit] Speak with Kud-Ei, an Argonian in Bravil's Mages Guild, to learn about her missing friend Henantier. It turns out he is not missing at all, but he has been experimenting with dangerous magic against the regulations of the Mages Guild. This could get him expelled, so Kud-Ei does not want to seek help through regular channels. Dreamworld Amulet[edit] Follow Kud-Ei from the Mages Guild to Henantier's house. Speak with Kud-Ei again to learn that Henantier created an amulet that would let him consciously explore his dreams. However, it seems he is now trapped within his Dreamworld. Kud-Ei cannot enter his Dreamworld, because Henantier would dismiss her presence as conjured memory from his own mind, so she needs a total stranger to help him escape. Speak with Kud-Ei again to receive the amulet; equip the amulet, and go to sleep. Henantier's Dreamworld[edit] You then enter Henantier's Dreamworld; you will lose your entire inventory except for the amulet. Furthermore, the amulet does not allow the use of magic, although any spell immune to Silence, such as Powers, will still work. Upon entering the Dreamworld, you will be approached by Henantier, who seems to have lost valuable parts of his mind that must be found. Remember to look around the house to find extras. There are a few health potions downstairs in an overturned cupboard labeled Heal Yourself, which may be useful later. The Alteration skill book The Lunar Lorkhan can be found behind the overturned table at the head of the bed; although you can't take it with you once you exit the Dreamworld, you may still benefit from the skill increase if this is your first time reading it. In Oblivion Remastered, the skill book is no longer present (see bugs). Four Tests[edit] In total, you will have to complete four tests. The tests of Perception and Patience are located on the upper floor, and the tests of Courage and Resolve are on the lower floor; you can take them in any order. When you complete a test, you will be transported back to Henantier. Test of Perception[edit] Entrance to the Test of Perception(Oblivion Remastered) Element of Perception(Oblivion Remastered) Look before you leap, as this room is filled with traps. Take the torch from the box and start walking the path, taking care not to walk on any suspicious looking tiles. Some have obvious trap triggers on them, while others look like they are crumbling and will cause you to fall into the Abyss. If you step on a pressure plate, stop immediately, as they will cause a rockslide directly in front of you. At the end of the path you will find Henantier's Perception. There are several obvious places to stand and catch your breath.  Test of Resolve[edit] Two minotaurs must first be defeated(Oblivion Remastered) Element of Resolve(Oblivion Remastered) You must defeat two minotaurs from Henantier's Dreamworld. A box provides you with several sets of leveled equipment: heavy armor, light armor, a blade weapon, a blunt weapon, and a lightning staff. Using the lightning staff will allow you to take them down quickly without getting yourself hurt. After you have defeated the minotaurs, a staircase will appear that will lead you to Henantier's Resolve. If your Acrobatics skill is high enough, it is possible to jump up on to one of the four tall columns in the center of the arena where you fight the minotaurs, and then jump up to the platform where the Element of Resolve is located, allowing you to bypass the fight with the minotaurs entirely.  Test of Courage[edit] The entry to the water(Oblivion Remastered) Element of Courage(Oblivion Remastered) Here you must dive deep through an underwater tunnel and since you can get turned around because the swimming movements are not that precise, it is one of the more difficult tests. First get a weak potion of the sea from a chest before beginning the Test. Wade in as far as possible before diving in to minimize the time needed to swim halfway through the tunnel to reach the other Potion of the Sea found at the bottom of a shaft. Swim into the tunnel and drink the first potion when you are low on air. Pick up the second and then keep heading downward (ignore the green compass arrow) to follow the tunnel to reach the wooden door of the Grotto of Courage at the end of the underwater passage. Henantier's Element of Courage is inside.  Test of Patience[edit] Element of Patience(Oblivion Remastered) Test of Patience Take the Mysterious Scroll from the box. It contains instructions on how you should walk on the tiles without setting off the traps. Look for a series of identical symbols that form a path from the bottom of the diagrams to the top, and follow that path on the tiles. Past all three sets of tiles, you will find Henantier's Patience. If you're impatient, jumping over a row or two of tiles is also possible, although hazardous due to the Dart Traps that fire when stepping on a wrong tile.  Back to the Real World[edit] After you have completed all four tests, speak with Henantier again, who seems to have regained his wits. He sees the truth in your words and you'll be transported back to the real world. Your inventory will be returned and all items from the Dreamworld are removed. Henantier gives you six scrolls as a reward. If you have installed the Spell Tomes official download, any of the scrolls may be replaced by one, just as with usual scroll loot."

Learn of Motierre's plot to fake his death and wait for Hides-His-Heart to arrive. When Hides-His-Heart arrives, ""kill"" Motierre and flee. Revive Motierre in the Chapel Undercroft, and lead him to the local inn. Return to Valtieri to collect your reward, advance in rank, and change your Dark Brotherhood liaison.","To Serve Sithis[edit] ""Oh, you have been a naughty boy, Motierre, haven't you?"" Speak with Vicente Valtieri in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary to complete the ""To Serve Sithis"" mini-quest and receive Vicente's final contract. It seems Francois Motierre in Chorrol borrowed a lot of money from underworld types and has missed a payment. The lenders don't even want the money. They feel insulted and want him dead, sending an enforcer to kill him. Francois has hired The Dark Brotherhood to fake his death and take the life of his mother instead, a detail Vicente tells you has already been handled by Lucien Lachance. Vicente gives you the tools you'll need to fake Motierre's death: a single-use dagger coated with a special poison called Languorwine that can make it appear that a person has died, and an antidote to revive him later. Motierre's Plan[edit] Travel to Chorrol and break into Motierre's house in order to speak with him. His house is located just north of the Chorrol South Gate and is protected by a Hard lock. Once inside, Francois tells you that those he is indebted to have sent the enforcer Hides-His-Heart to kill him. He wants you to use the dagger Vicente gave you to slash him once, fooling the enforcer into believing he is dead. You are to then flee Chorrol without killing the enforcer. That way Hides-His-Heart will believe Motierre is dead and return to his organization and inform them that a Dark Brotherhood assassin got to Motierre first. You are to then wait a day, locate his ""body"" in the Chapel Undercroft and use the antidote to revive him. Death and Revival[edit] ""Oh my, Aunt Margaret! You are looking the worse for wear..."" Hides-His-Heart will arrive shortly. Play your part in the charade and slice Francois once with your poisoned blade. The poison will take effect immediately and Motierre will appear to die. Hides-His-Heart will attack you at once, but if you harm him in any way you will acquire a bounty. Instead of fighting, flee Chorrol immediately. Return in one full day, go to the Chapel Undercroft and administer the antidote (activate the ""corpse"" and it will be administered automatically). It seems that revival is something to which the other inhabitants of the Undercroft take offense, seeing it as a desecration. After you have revived Francois, three Motierre Zombies will attack you (one right next to you and two others). Keep Motierre alive, as this is the only Dark Brotherhood mission that can be failed. The zombies can be avoided, as they spawn once you first talk with the revived Motierre. If you back away from him as soon as you wake him up and get closer to the undercroft door, you can talk to him there and quickly leave. Back to Safety[edit] Kill or avoid the zombies and make your way to The Grey Mare Inn with Motierre so that he can buy passage out of Cyrodiil, then return to Vicente. If you successfully completed the quest, you will receive Cruelty's Heart, a leveled amulet that adds Willpower and Strength; advancement to Eliminator rank; and the Sanctuary Well Key. The key allows easier access to the Sanctuary via the well outside. If you kill Hides-His-Heart, fail to save Motierre, or kill Motierre, you fail this quest. You are allowed to proceed with the Dark Brotherhood questline, but there are negative consequences. Vicente's disposition will markedly drop (-71, instead of +80 for successfully completing the quest); this may result in him turning aggressive, so you may want to be prepared with Charm spells. You will also not receive 1 Infamy point for this quest. Additionally, several rewards will be delayed until the completion of the next quest, The Lonely Wanderer: he will not give you the well key, you will not gain the rank of Eliminator, and, if you are playing on Xbox 360, you will not obtain the achievement for the rank of Eliminator. Vicente will no longer be your liaison in the Brotherhood after this quest; instead, you will receive new contracts from Ocheeva."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Trolls_of_Forsaken_Mine","Speak with Modryn Oreyn to receive this quest. Travel to Forsaken Mine. Explore the mine and kill the remaining trolls. Find Viranus Donton's body and his journal. Take the journal and return to Modryn.","The Trouble with Trolls[edit] Upon speaking to Modryn Oreyn after completing The Fugitives and The Wandering Scholar, he'll reveal that a group of Fighters Guild members headed by Viranus Donton have not been heard from for a few days after setting out on a contract. Their contract involved clearing out a nest of trolls in Forsaken Mine, located just south of Leyawiin. This lack of communication is particularly troubling and Modryn requests that you travel to the mine and determine what is going on. He'll mark the location of Forsaken Mine on your map. Worrying Evidence[edit] Once you start exploring the mine, it becomes apparent that something has gone awry with the mission. In the first zone of the mine you will discover the bodies of Ariente, Ashtus Chenius and Cartrus Gavinius - some of Viranus's contingent of fighters. As you travel deeper into the mine, you will discover more dead Fighters Guild members - those of Cargas Laftrius, Mattius Wotrus and Lashana, but also the corpse of a Blackwood Company member. This is a puzzling and troubling sign. As you travel towards the entrance to the second level of the mine you'll encounter your first troll - actually a leveled Savage Troll - so commence completing the unfinished contract in your search for survivors. A Savage Fate Revealed[edit] The mine's second zone is infested with eight more Savage Trolls. Move carefully through the mine to ensure that you aren't overwhelmed.  Drawing them off one at a time where possible is the best strategy. Another strategy that works is to hit the troll and then step back. As they often use their power attack, you can dodge it and attack them again as they recoil. In an upper chamber of the Lost Passages, you may notice pools of blood against an apparently blank wall. Closer examination of the blood reveals a movable stone wall and a passage leading downwards, with a trail of blood. The final chamber reveals Viranus's sad fate. His body lies near that of Eduard Hodge, the final missing member of the Guild party. Searching Viranus's body will reveal a bloodied journal. Within its pages you will discover the younger Donton brother's troubling final months and moments, including the fate of the party and his companion Eduard Hodge. It seems Viranus's party were in the middle of clearing out the trolls when Blackwood Company members suddenly appeared. The Blackwood members unleashed hell, killing both Fighters Guild members and trolls alike in a frenzied but short-lived attack, departing as fast as they appeared. Viranus was gravely wounded in the attack, penning his final moments in the journal as the surviving trolls approached. A sad fate for a troubled warrior. Bearer of Bad News[edit] Delivering the tragic news and Viranus's journal to Modryn elicits an angry response and a condemnation of the Blackwood Company's latest exploits. Your only reward is one Fame point. Modryn wants you to ""lay low for a while"" and indicates he will break the news to Vilena Donton concerning the loss of her last remaining son. Modryn hints that this latest tragedy may signal an end to his career in the Fighters Guild and refers you to Azzan or Burz gro-Khash for further contracts."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Turning_a_Blind_Eye","Wait until Methredhel finds you and gives you a message. Meet and talk to the Gray Fox at Helvius Cecia's home in Bruma. Travel to the Temple of the Ancestor Moths. Ask the monks about the Moth Priests. Find your way down through the catacombs. Retrieve the Stone and find your way back out.","Fencing the Goods[edit] In order to start this quest, you need to have fenced at least 600 gold in stolen goods. Once that's done, Methredhel will eventually arrive with a message for you to meet the Gray Fox at Helvius Cecia's house in Bruma. The fastest way for this to happen is to travel to the Imperial City and wait for 24 hours, at which point Methredhel will appear. Another option is to go to Methredhel which will initiate the dialogue about the message. Head to Bruma and enter Helvius' house where you will finally meet the Gray Fox. He'll ask you to steal Savilla's Stone from the underground catacombs connected to the Temple of the Ancestor Moths, a remote monastery for retired Blind Moth Priests, and marks the location on your map. He warns you not to shed innocent blood but says there will be no blood price on your head for the stone's guardians, human or inhuman. He also tells you to be well prepared as the area is extensive and well guarded. Bring lots of lockpicks or the Skeleton Key; alternatively, if your combat skills are better than your security, there is a common area on the right shortly past where Brother Holger leaves you. The guardians in there carry a crypt key which will let you through all the doors; just lure one out into the hallway (this is the point where the blood price ends). Finding some Moth Priests[edit] Travel to the monastery, far north of Cheydinhal (near Azura's Shrine if you've found it earlier), and speak with any of the servant monks to learn a bit about the Moth Priests. They don't know anything about the stone, however. Speak with Brother Holger (he may be inside the Ancestor Moth Crypt) about the stone and he'll lead you to the secret catacombs if his disposition is greater than 80. You'll need to do some disposition raising before anyone will tell you anything. Follow the quest marker through the twisty maze full of monks and undead. The monks may be blind but they are not helpless and have good hearing. There's no blood price for killing them though and they have keys. There are several locked doors from ""Average"" to ""Very Hard"" in the catacombs. Watch out for traps on the third level. These include mace tripwires, a log tripwire, a gas chamber, floor spikes that hurt if you jump on them, and a few others. Getting the Stone[edit] There are two stones in the middle of the room. Savilla's Stone, i.e., the one you are trying to get, is off to one side of the central platform. In the middle of the platform, there is a Dark Welkynd Stone which will fire spells at you as you approach. Keep an eye on the Dark Welkynd Stone at all times. This variety of Dark Welkynd Stone will fire at you even if you stop moving, so whenever the stone is glowing brightly, wait for it to fire and then sidestep to avoid its blasts. Invisibility and chameleon do not prevent the stone from detecting you. There are various methods for getting the stone. You can kill the Blind Moth Prelate (without any blood price) if you want. You can sneak behind the prelate. Although he is blind, he is able to detect you unless you have a high sneak skill. When you are standing behind him, you will be spotted by the Dark Welkynd Stone, but since you are behind the prelate, the blasts from the stone will only damage him. He will try to heal himself, but eventually he dies. With high enough sneak skill and/or Invisibility, you can sneak past the prelate and grab the stone without him noticing. You can shoot the stone off its altar with a fire spell (shock or frost spells do not cause much impact upon hit). With careful positioning, it is possible to move the stone to a location where you can grab it without being noticed by the prelate. You can use a regular bow and iron arrows, to knock it down and behind an accessible pillar. Sneaking to collect, without the monk or Dark Welkynd Stone detecting you. You can use a long range Telekinesis spell and pull it to you (the range needs to be longer than the 10 feet provided by Remote Manipulation). You can quickly run down the stairs, grab Savilla's Stone and hurry back out. If timed correctly, it is possible to avoid the blasts from the Dark Welkynd Stone and evade the prelate. Finding Your way Out Again[edit] Instead of taking the long way out of the dungeon, you can turn northeast from where you took the Stone and find a ladder to the Monastery. Before you leave there is a chest near a bedroll inside of which is a handbill entitled Instructions: The Gray Cowl describing a ""quest"" the monks would undertake: discover the origins of the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal. Later on, ask the Gray Fox about this new topic and listen to what he has to say."

Meet back with the Emperor and continue to follow him. Take the Amulet of Kings and exit the sewers.","Humble Beginnings[edit] RemasteredOblivion You're told to stand by the window in the back of your cell. You're told to stand by the window in the back of your cell. The game begins in a bare prison cell with little more to your name than your clothing: a sack cloth shirt, pants, and sandals along with wrist irons. As you explore the cell and become accustomed to your surroundings, a prisoner in the cell opposite yours threatens and berates you. When he's finished, the Emperor of Tamriel, Uriel Septim VII, and three of his bodyguards arrive at your cell and are surprised to find you in it. One guard orders you to stand aside and then the Emperor steps in. As he enters, the Emperor recognizes you from a prophetic dream, and explains that his bodyguards, the Blades, are leading him through a secret escape route. The reason for the guards' surprise becomes clear: the cell you occupy was supposed to be left empty because the route happens to start in your cell. The Emperor pardons you of any crimes you may have committed, and allows you to follow him for a time. Note that this pardon also extends to crimes committed while attempting to escape the prison: You may attempt to steal from the guards or the Emperor. They are set to like you, meaning that if you are caught, they will not try to attack you. However, do note that pickpocketing is very hard at lower levels of Sneak. Attacking the Emperor or his guards will trigger the standard consequences for assault such as a bounty and possible Infamy. However if you gain a bounty in the sewers, it will be reset to 0 as soon as you leave. This allows for two major exploits: Claiming the Emperor's silver shortsword: If you attack the Emperor, he will draw his sword. Yield to him by holding the block key and initiate a conversation with him. Around the time that you pick a birthsign, he will drop the sword. Training through assault: When you emerge from the Natural Caverns to rejoin the Emperor, Baurus and Glenroy, you will be on a raised area that they can't get to and they have no ranged weapons or spells. You can practice your Marksman and Destruction skills on them free of repercussions; they are all unkillable. When you're done, jump down and talk to the Emperor and they will stop trying to attack you. An Alternate Route[edit] RemasteredOblivion The wall crumbles down and reveals another path. The wall crumbles down and reveals another path. No sooner do you enter the escape route alongside the Blades than you and your companions are confronted by assassins clad in blood red robes and jet black armor, who attempt to cut a path through the Blades to the Emperor. The assassins are unusually strong; unless you are playing on a very low difficulty, it may be wise to sit back and let the Blades do their jobs. Although they are quickly subdued, they manage to slay the Captain, Renault. You cannot loot Renault's armor from her corpse, though you can take her Akaviri Katana, torch, and a Steel Shortsword. Her katana, however, cannot be kept; Baurus will take it from you at the end of the tutorial. After the battle, the Blades—distrustful of you—force you to stay behind and lock the only exit behind them, forcing you to find another way out of the prison. As you look around, a pair of rats suddenly burst through an unstable section of a wall and begin to attack you. Dispatch them in whichever way you please, though this early in the game your combat options are limited to either your fists, a steel shortsword from Renault's corpse, or the late Renault's katana. You can also use the Flare spell that you start with; you don't have to wait for that part of the tutorial. Afterwards, proceed through the hole in the wall made by the rats to discover a lost cavern—and a new way out. The path ahead is straightforward, populated only by a variety of rats, goblins, and undead. There are a few treasures hidden along the path, so keep your eyes open—most are obvious if you're observant enough. Almost everything in the tutorial is preset, though you can still find variations of some items in a few places. Reuniting with the Emperor[edit] After passing through the Natural Caverns, you find yourself on a ledge overlooking the Emperor and his Blades, who briefly debate their tactical options before being attacked by another group of assassins. As soon as you jump from your vantage point to their level, the Blades become infuriated at your appearance and flirt with the idea of killing you on the spot, suspecting you to be an assassin as well. This idea, however, is soon quelled by the Emperor, who demands that you not only be left unharmed but also allowed to follow. He briefly discusses the Nine Divines and fate with you before asking about your birthsign, at which point you are able to select your character's birthsign. After choosing your birthsign, the Blades reluctantly agree to the Emperor's request and Baurus—the more level-headed of the two—gives you a torch to carry to illuminate their path unless you are already holding one. However, you are not required to carry the torch; it is merely a suggestion on Baurus' part. As you accompany the Emperor the group is beset by more assassins. Because the Blades can effortlessly take care of any nearby threats, it is very easy to slip away from battle to retrieve any treasure. The Circle Opens[edit] RemasteredOblivion Assassins often appear from the shadows in these halls. Assassins often appear from the shadows in these halls. As you and your companions reach the entrance to the sewers, the next area on the escape route, you find the entrance to the sewers is barred from the other side, rendering you unable to go further. Cornered, the group is ambushed by a battalion of assassins, and the two Blades stash you and the Emperor in a small side room with orders to guard him with your life. Attempting to fight the assassins at this point causes assassins to spawn endlessly. As the two seasoned soldiers battle the assassins, greatly outnumbered, the Emperor turns and speaks to you. He ominously says that he can go no further, and that although there seems to be no hope in sight, there is one last heir to the throne not already murdered: an illegitimate son. Quickly, he bestows the Amulet of Kings upon you, and orders you to deliver it to Jauffre at Weynon Priory, who alone knows where to find the last heir. He bids you farewell, cryptically saying that you must ""close shut the jaws of Oblivion."" Shortly afterward, a panel in the wall slides away, and from it emerges an assassin who mercilessly strikes down the helpless Emperor in a single stroke before turning his sights on you. The Emperor's death is scripted and there is no way to prevent it, as your character is frozen in place during the action. Baurus soon rushes in to help you deal with the last remaining assassin and adds to the already gloomy outlook by announcing that Glenroy, his counterpart, has fallen as well. After relating to him the Emperor's last instructions, he entrusts you with the key to the sewers and questions you on your class. It is at this point you are able to select your class. After selecting your class, Baurus stays behind to guard the Emperor's body and ensure no assassins follow you. If you retrieved Renault's and/or Glenroy's katana, Baurus will take them from you to be returned to a place of honor given to fallen Blades. As the katanas are scripted to be removed, it is impossible to keep them without the use of the console. RemasteredOblivion The view from the exit of the sewers The view from the exit of the sewers Your journey through the sewers is a brief one, and the only resistance you encounter pales in comparison to that of the Natural Caverns. Eventually you will come upon a grate protecting a long tunnel leading outside (it is rather obvious where the exit is; daylight will beam through it), where you have one last chance to alter your race, class and birthsign. Adjust them as you see fit, if at all, save, and exit the sewers to finish the tutorial and be treated to a breathtaking view of the local area and the  world beyond. To emphasize: It might be wise to save the game just before you exit the sewers. That way, you don't have to redo the entire tutorial if you decide to start over. Any bounty you may have acquired in-game at this point (such as from attacking the Emperor) will be immediately cleared upon leaving the sewers. From here you are free to continue on as you wish. You may continue with the main quest, or you may explore Cyrodiil, doing whatever you please. The brilliance of Oblivion is the freedom it offers in gameplay; you may now experience that freedom first hand."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Two_Sides_of_the_Coin","Listen to rumors around Bruma to learn about a man making off with his girlfriend's money. Speak with Arnora Auria. Get into the jail to speak to Jorundr. Decide on your course of action and receive your reward.","Arnora Auria[edit] Listen to rumors around Bruma to learn of a woman named Arnora Auria whose boyfriend Jorundr tried to run away with her money. He was caught in the act and is being held in the Bruma jail. Speak to Arnora in her house behind the chapel. When her disposition is high enough (60+) she will tell you that she and Jorundr are actually a pair of thieves who made a living by stealing just enough to get by. According to Arnora, Jorundr started wanting more and eventually killed a guard while robbing a tax collector. Days later, while Arnora was getting some food, guards captured Jorundr at their camp. Unfortunately, he had hidden the tax money and Arnora cannot get to it. Arnora asks you to speak with Jorundr and find out where the money is hidden. If Arnora dies at this point (specifically, if she dies before you strike a bargain with Jorundr), the quest will end as soon as you talk to Jorundr. In this case, you receive 1 Infamy point (instead of the usual 1 Fame point) and you do not receive any reward. Speak with Jorundr[edit] You will find Jorundr in the Bruma jail. No matter how much you persuade him, he will not trust you. In order to gain his confidence, you will have to get yourself arrested and sent to jail. A quick way to do this is to pick up one of the items on the jail tables or attack the guards. Once you have been jailed, Jorundr will tell you that it was in fact Arnora who grew greedy and killed the guard. Jorundr tells you that he will reveal the location of the money if you kill Arnora and bring him her amulet. If you wait a while before serving your sentence, a guard named Tyrellius Logellus will approach Jorundr and try to convince him to reveal the location of the treasure. See the crime article for details on how to serve your sentence or, alternatively, how to escape from jail. Choosing Sides[edit] There are two ways to proceed at this point: Kill Arnora. The easiest way to do this is to tell her you'll kill her and run outside. She will follow and the guards will proceed to attack her. You can also choose to kill her in cold blood (without initiating conversation) and initiate the Dark Brotherhood questline. Take the pendant and her keys. If you return to Jorundr immediately, he will tell you that Arnora's true amulet has a red stone, not the blue one you've taken from her body. Return to the house and search her bedroom chest to discover the true one. You can save yourself the extra footwork by taking the true amulet from the chest before seeing Jorundr to report Arnora's death. Alternately, trick Jorundr into believing that Arnora is dead. To do this, tell Arnora you will help her and she will give you the key needed to retrieve the true amulet. However, if you choose this method and then proceed to kill Arnora in cold blood before discovering the gold's location, the quest will automatically end with a message that one of the persons needed in this quest has been killed. After acquiring Arnora's True Amulet by any of the aforementioned methods, ask the Jailor to allow you to speak to Jorundr in the jail. Show the amulet to Jorundr. He will believe that Arnora is dead and tell you the location of the treasure. If you allowed Arnora to live, Tyrellius will be waiting for you by the treasure chest. He has killed Arnora and will now try to kill you. If you killed Arnora to gain the amulet(s), Tyrellius will not appear. Reward[edit] The treasure includes two skill books. One of the books will always be one of the seven Stealth skill books that appear in random loot; the other books will be for either a Magic or Combat skill (selected from one of the thirteen skill books that appear in random loot)."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Ulterior_Motives","Speak with Raminus Polus. He tells you to travel to Skingrad and retrieve a book from the Count. When you arrive at Castle Skingrad, you will be directed to Mercator Hosidus who tells you the Count will not see you, but suggests you return tomorrow. The next day, Mercator will tell you the Count has agreed to meet you away from prying eyes at 2am, north of Cursed Mine. Go to the meeting point, which is actually southeast of the mine, where you are ambushed by Mercator and his fellow Necromancers. The Count of Skingrad will also arrive during the fight. Afterwards, the Count speaks to you about the delicate relationship between himself and the guild, a pretense you can see in his eyes. When all is understood, return to Raminus for a promotion and the Spelldrinker Amulet.","The Rarest Book in Cyrodiil[edit] After completing A Mage's Staff, speak to Raminus Polus to receive your next task, which is related to the Necromancers you found at Wellspring Cave. All he wants is for you to retrieve a book from Janus Hassildor, Count of Skingrad. He warns you that Skingrad can be an ""unusual place"". To Be Entertained[edit] Head over to Castle Skingrad and speak to any guard to learn that all appointments with the Count must go through Mercator Hosidus. Find Mercator in the Castle County Hall during the day. It seems the Count is aware of your presence but doesn't feel like granting you an audience at the moment. Mercator suggests trying again tomorrow. Return a full day later and speak to Mercator. It seems the Count has agreed to meet with you, but not in the castle. Instead, you're to meet him north of Cursed Mine at 2am. The mine is just west of town; although the quest log tells you to meet the Count north of the mine, the meeting is actually southeast of the mine, next to the field of grapes at Tamika's vineyard (follow your quest compass). Wait around until 2am (Mercator actually comes around 10pm). Clever Chap[edit] Unfortunately, it seems that Mercator tricked you and the Count is not coming. In fact, Mercator and his fellow Necromancers (namely Arterion and Mondrar Henim) have come to kill you. Fortunately, you have an ally as the Count himself appears during the ensuing fight. If you are having trouble with this fight, run towards the gate. If you are having trouble getting to the City Guard in time, initiate speech with Mercator while standing on the fence. After the dialogue, jump down and run to the guards. This will net you a few extra seconds to get away. The guards there will help you. After the Necromancers are dead, the Count will chew you out for being a gullible fool and demand you thank him for ""saving"" you, even if you killed all the enemies before he even showed up. In the dialogue with Janus after the battle, you learn that he suspected Mercator was allied with the Necromancers, but needed to know just how many others were with him before acting. He also explains that the Mages Guild was actually using you to spy on him to see what connections he had with the Necromancers. Janus tells you to explain to Raminus that he had no connections with the Necromancers and that they should not send anyone else under false pretenses. Return to Raminus, who apologizes for putting you in such a situation. It seems the Count is actually an ally and the guild was worried that sending a higher official would bring too much attention to the tenuous relationship with the Count. After completing this quest, you will ascend to the rank of Evoker, whereupon you will receive the Spelldrinker Amulet."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Ultimate_Heist","After fencing at least 1000 gold in stolen items, the Gray Fox will contact you for a mission. Sneak into the Imperial Palace Basement and activate the Glass of Time to enter the Imperial City's sewers. Make your way through The Old Way and The Lost Catacombs to the Hall of Epochs. Sneak through the Imperial Palace to the Elder Library. After receiving the Elder Scroll, escape from the Imperial Battlemage's Room and return to the Gray Fox. Take the ring the Gray Fox gave you to the Countess of Anvil, Millona Umbranox. After some secrets are revealed, accept the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal to become the new Thieves Guild Guildmaster and Gray Fox.","Plans[edit] Once more, Amusei summons you to see the Gray Fox. This time Amusei will send you to Othrelos' house in the Imperial City. The last three quests were a preparation for the ultimate job: retrieve an Elder Scroll from the Imperial Palace. He makes no secret that this will be a most dangerous and daring task and warns you to be prepared. He gives a detailed plan for the heist, involving going through the sewers into the Old Way (an old escape route) to reach the Elder Library, impersonating Celia Camoran to intercept the scroll, and making the getaway. He gives you an Imperial Sewer Key for access to the Palace Sewers, the restored Arrow of Extrication, and the Boots of Springheel Jak. He also tells you that there will be no blood price during this quest. Glass of Time[edit] The first task before you can begin your descent into the sewers is to sneak into the Palace Basement (downstairs from the Elder Council Chambers in the palace) and activate the Glass of Time (a giant hourglass). You can also complete this task without sneaking by picking the lock then making a beeline for the Glass of Time (if you are willing to incur a bounty). A third option is to just skip this step completely. Supposedly, activating the Glass of Time unlocks the Old Way, but because of a minor scripting mistake this step is actually optional. If you know where to head once you're in the sewers, you can head straight to the Palace Sewers entrance. (This appears to have been fixed in the remaster, this step may now be mandatory. The quest will update but the Old Way remains sealed.) The City Sewers and Old Way[edit] The main trip is a lengthy dungeon crawl, so before proceeding, it is worth making sure that you have everything you will need, including enough lockpicks and a bow to fire the Arrow of Extrication (the game will also provide a bow in the form of a guaranteed Skeleton Archer enemy, but of course, you will need to defeat it first). Once you are ready, head into the South East Tunnel sewer entrance from the Arboretum. Proceed through to Beneath the Bloodworks and make your way past the various undead creatures including skeletons, vampires, ghosts, and wraiths. Head into the Palace Sewers, unlocked with the Imperial Sewer Key that the Gray Fox provided. Proceed through the two zones called The Old Way and on through The Lost Catacombs. At the end of the Lost Catacombs, there is a large rectangular room with a tiered upper level. On the north side of the room, there's a stairway to the upper level, but there is a large gap in the stairs. Equip the Boots of Springheel Jak and you will be able to jump over the gap. On the upper level, you will find two push blocks; one on your immediate right, which will activate the two dormant Dark Welkynd Stones, and one push block on the other side of the room; activate this one in order to open the gate and access the next zone, the Hall of Epochs. Hall of Epochs[edit] Ayleid Guardian - Timeless Defender Not far in, you'll come to a huge chamber with a large statue, identified as the Keyhole Pillar, flanked by two smaller statues. A quest update in your journal lets you know that this is where you need to use the Arrow of Extrication. In order to fire the arrow, you need to be standing in a specific spot to open the keyhole on the pillar. The update hints that the location needs to be somewhere with a clear view of the pillar. If you start exploring the room, another quest update will let you know when you're approaching the right area. The correct location for firing the arrow is blocked by walls and locked gates. You may attempt to simply jump the gap from the ledge behind, although it will be a challenging feat even with the Boots unless you yourself have a high level of acrobatics. The intended way for you to reach the location is to lower the walls by activating a hidden Push Block. If you head south from the main room, you'll find a Push Block on the balcony—this doesn't affect the walls in the main room, but it does open a hidden door. Continuing past the hidden door leads to a new zone (also named the Hall of Epochs). The Push Block you're looking for is at the end of this zone. Returning to the main room will reveal that the walls have dropped away (freeing some undead) and that the gates have opened. If you didn't bring along a bow, make sure to get a bow at this point: one of the four undead who were just freed is guaranteed to be an archer who carries a bow. When you stand on the pressure plate, the keyhole in the Keyhole Pillar is opened up; if you step off the plate, the keyhole closes again. Only your presence on the plate triggers the keyhole; other creatures or corpses will not be recognized. Therefore, you need to be standing on the plate when you fire the Arrow of Extrication. The game will say you only have one chance, but if you miss, you can just retrieve the arrow and try again. Still, you may want to practice first with a few regular arrows, aiming for above the keyhole (and not straight at it) since it is a long distance shot; watch for the puff of dust that indicates where the arrow hits and listen for the sound of the arrow hitting its target. If you're having trouble, try aiming at the cross formed at the hilt of the statue's sword, or possibly slightly lower, where the top of the statue's hands come together. If you listen carefully, an accurate shot produces a sound of metal on metal, even if a regular arrow is used. If a message appears saying ""you cannot fire this quest arrow now"" try hotkeying the Arrow of Extrication and then reloading a previous save. Once you've got the key into the statue, it'll lift up from the ground and reveal a door. When you are close enough, the two statues beside the door come to life as Ayleid Guardians. They provide a challenging fight, although it is much easier to simply sneak past them. If they do see you, simply running will not help: they will follow you and alert all of the guards in the palace to your presence. Once you are past the guardians, go down the stairs to the door and open it. (You might need to remove your armor to avoid waking the guards in the next room). The prize within your grasp... The Elder Scroll[edit] You emerge in the Imperial Guard Quarters. Be very careful not to get caught during this part of the quest. If you are, you will not be able to go back up to the palace and are left with no way of finishing the quest. Prepare to do some serious sneaking through two doors, one of which is locked, to reach the outer round corridor (although some of the doors may already be opened by the guards). One way to make this part easier is to wait by the open statue until it is 1am then enter while the guards are sleeping. Then go up a level to reach the Elder Scrolls Library. Sneak past the guard and enter the main core of the library. You'll see two corridors curving away on either side of you. Follow the right one first. You'll come up behind a seated Blind Moth Priest. If you're sneaking, he won't turn. Pull the lever to his back right and creep back the other way, all the way around the level. You'll now be facing the blind priest, and beside a door that the lever opened. Go inside the library and sit down in the Reading Chair—not one of the benches around the side of the room. The priests, thinking you are Celia Camoran, will bring you the Elder Scroll. Escape from Palace[edit] Take the scroll (when unobserved) and make your escape. You may also want to take two useful Shadow scrolls from the bookcase, which each provide 50% Chameleon. You can't go back the way you came, but instead must head up the nearby stairs. Make your way through the Moth Priest's Quarters to the Imperial Battlemage's Chambers. Sneak past the guard, Evangeline Beanique. Alternatively, there is no Blood Price for killing her, but it will result in suspension from the Mages Guild if you are a member, and may alert the guards. In the fireplace, there's a chute leading somewhere. It's a long, long jump. You can use the Boots of Springheel Jak to jump safely, but they'll be destroyed by the jump (you land safely when wearing the boots because it is a scripted effect, not actually because the boots provide +50 Fortify Acrobatics; the same script then removes the boots). The Gray Fox breaks the curse The fall is easily survived without the boots by having enough Acrobatics, or good health—or if you can sufficiently fortify either. It can be done with just around 40 Acrobatics if you have at least around 180 health. Don't reequip the boots without saving first because if you jump with them on while still on the quest they could be destroyed. There is a small sloped ledge just a few feet below the grate itself that can be used to briefly slow your fall. While not a great help, this ledge will save you a few health points that could ultimately be the difference between life and death. Another way to survive the fall, if you have at least 30 Acrobatics and 110 health, is to equip an item which fortifies health by at least 15 and consume two of the Surilie Wines found in the room. It is recommended that you use the Surilie Brothers Vintage 415 and Surilie Brothers Vintage 399 as you will likely have more health after the fall. An alternative to jumping is to intentionally get arrested by the guards in the Imperial Palace. You will be sent to jail, but once released you will still have the Elder Scroll and can take it to the Gray Fox Before doing this, however, you must first return to the trapdoor in the Guard Barracks where you first entered from the Hall of Epochs. Attempting to open the trapdoor will give you the same quest update that you would get from jumping down the chute in the fireplace. It is critical that you get this quest update before being arrested, otherwise you will never be able to finish the quest. No matter how you choose to do the jump, you end up back at the entrance to the Old Way. Head back through the sewers and return to the Gray Fox with the grand prize. Countess of Anvil[edit] Corvus Umbranox comes clean Now the Gray Fox gives you another task: give his ring to the Countess of Anvil. He says it may cause anger or tears, and if she asks, tell her it's from a ""stranger"". Go to Anvil and do what he says. To show her the ring, you'll have to talk to her when she is sitting in the Great Hall. If you are there at night when she sleeps you will have to wait until morning. The Countess recognizes it as the wedding ring of her long-lost husband, who had disappeared ten years ago. Gray Cowl of Nocturnal[edit] RemasteredOblivion Corvus reinstated as Count Umbranox Corvus reinstated as Count Umbranox At that moment, a man (a Stranger, the master forger) stands up and approaches the throne. He makes a declaration about Emer Dareloth being the one who stole the Cowl of Nocturnal, and says he's her husband Corvus and the Gray Fox. He received the cowl from the previous Guildmaster who was at the end of a line of guildmasters right back to Dareloth, each one of whom had inherited the curse along with the cowl, erasing them from history and the memories of everyone who knew them. He was the first to realize that he could use the power of the Elder Scrolls to break the curse. Having done so, he is recognized by Countess Umbranox as her husband on the condition that he renounces his life of crime. He gives you the Cowl and the title of Gray Fox and tells you that the Guild's hall has been restored due to the curse being lifted and, thus, its history having been changed. You get another entry when you hit the Imperial City. The former Gray Fox has been restored as Count of Anvil and Dareloth's home is restored as the Thieves Guild Hall. The top floor is the Guildmaster's Quarters, which can be used as a home. However, the containers in the rest of the building are not safe for storage. There's a locked room with a handful of lockpicks on the table and a Security skill book upstairs but nothing more. Armand will be available upstairs when he's not outside at the Waterfront. With the grand quest over, you're free to do as you like as the new Guildmaster of the Thieves Guild. More details about the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal can be found on its page."

If you check the ""abandoned knapsack"" right next to the door you will find a small diary. Of immediate interest is the password (""Chimer""). The rest of the diary is an entertaining read, revealing that the steward on the other side of the door (according to a note) is supposed to keep an eye on the cousin of Drothan, who appears to be in charge of opening the door. In order to find Drothan there is a journal in his cabin that provides more information. Use the password to open the door, and deal with the Drothmeri steward, recruits, soldiers, and veterans on the other side. The Steward's Registry on the table reveals that Drothan has been amassing a few troops here. Continue exploring the fort ruins, and you will find a door to the next area, ""Sundercliff Village"". Before you leave this area, you may wish to go back to the start and dump your loot in the chest on the east side of the first room or another suitable container. Sundercliff Village[edit] The subterranean village There really is a village in Sundercliff Village... the village is in a huge underground cavern, large enough to contain a half dozen houses, occupied by more of the Drothmeri army, and a handful of Argonian laborers. If you're just interested in getting through the quest, follow your map arrow, which is leading you through to the next area in search of Drothan's cabin. If you're interested in exploring, though, take some time to check out the village. Be prepared to kill or avoid a lot of people. If you choose to kill them you can collect a lot of loot, including leveled armor, weapons, and a few enchanted items. Additional loot can be found in various chests (inside the houses) and hutches (outside). The most interesting building in the village is the ""Jail"", in the northwest corner of the main cave. Inside you will find a Morag Tong Assassin locked in a prison cell. A jailor's letter on a table reveals that the jailor has been trying unsuccessfully to find the writ revealing the assassin's target. On the same table are two pairs of the rare, zero-weight wrist irons. The assassin isn't particularly talkative, and doesn't seem interested in asking to be released. What to do with him is really just a matter of personal preference. If you release him, he will skulk off to proceed with his assassination; you are likely to cross paths with him again later, and he may help you by killing off a few enemies. You may prefer to just kill him and acquire his enchanted armor, which has various unique and powerful enchantments, as detailed on this page. If you let him go he will end up outside of the Inn of Ill Omen, found during the Dark Brotherhood initiation quest. The Village connects to two other areas: ""Sundercliff Forge"" (entrance on the east side of the main cave), and ""Sundercliff Commune"". The commune has two entrances, both on the west side of the main cave, one on the upper level, and one on the lower level. Your map arrow suggests you should proceed to Sundercliff Commune, through whichever of the two doors is closest. Sundercliff Commune[edit] Sundercliff Commune Sundercliff Commune features an upper level with a few more houses. A deep chasm in the middle can be descended via a long wooden ramp, revealing another house and an entrance to an Ayleid ruin. For now the ruin is inaccessible, because some type of enchantment is blocking the entrance. The destination you're looking for, ""Frathen Drothan's Quarters"", is on the upper level, to the north of the chasm. Depending upon which door you used to get here from Sundercliff Village, you may be on either the upper or the lower level. In Drothan's cabin you will find his journal sitting on a table; reading it updates your quest to tell you that your next job is to find two enchanted bezoars in order to be able to access the Ayleid ruin, Varsa Baalim. Before moving on it is worth doing a thorough search of Drothan's cabin. Items of particular interest include: The book Treatise on Ayleidic Cities that provides more of the backstory. A Varla Stone. Two vials of Trichobezoar Extract. Several Scrolls of Transmutation. Two are out in the open; seven more are hidden behind a locked false wall (on the east side of the room). Drothan's journal told you that the enchanted bezoars were entrusted to his two lieutenants, the Drothmeri Commander and the Forgemaster. The easiest is to start with the commander, whose house is right next door. If you released the Morag Tong Assassin, he is likely to show up here just as you arrive and assassinate the commander for you (leaving you free to loot the commander's corpse). The bezoar is upstairs on a side table. You may also want to explore the Veteran's Lodge on the lower level, where there is another boss-level chest (and a couple Drothmeri veterans looking for a fight). Outside in Sundercliff Commune you can also find several chests with gold, and an underground potato plant patch, complete with its own gardener! Sundercliff Forge[edit] The iron mines Hostile laborers can be found mining. The forge area Your next destination is the Forgemaster. To find him, you will need to head back to Sundercliff Village and cross to the east side of the main cave, where you'll find the door to Sundercliff Forge. Exploring Sundercliff Forge you will realize that you are on the upper of two levels, but there is no way at the moment to get to the lower level; you can just look down through some shafts in the floor. There is a rock wall right by the entrance, but you can't open it from here. Your only option is to proceed to the next area: ""Sundercliff Mines"". Once you get to the mines, you will find a new bunch of minions to mince. Some are the familiar Drothmeri soldiers, but you will also find many Khajiit and Argonian laborers, who like to fight with rakes and hoes. You enter the mines on the lower level of a large cavern, filled with iron veins. The passage to the upper level is in the southeast corner. The various parts of the upper level are connected by narrow walkways; make your way to the northeast corner where you will find a small passageway that leads back to the Forge (watch out for rockfalls!). This door leads you down to the lower level of the Forge, occupied by an Armor Apprentice, a Weapons Apprentice, and the Forgemaster himself. The Apprentice's Note on the table in one room, and the Letter Home on the table in another provide some entertainment. You may want to take the time to tip all the buckets hanging from the ceiling, all of which contain some loot. In most cases, it is just the ubiquitous iron ore nugget (which is pretty worthless by itself, but don't forget about the Scrolls of Transmutation), but other buckets will contain some more valuable gems. You can also collect a good deal of iron boots and longswords. Your target here is the Forgemaster. Killing him will yield a couple unique enchanted items, namely a Forgemaster's Amulet and Forgemaster's Smock; his other armor and weapons may also be enchanted. The bezoar is in the Forgemaster's tent, along with some gems and a boss-level chest (and look under the Forgemaster's bed to find his hidden bedtime reading material). Having accomplished your goal of finding the second bezoar, you can now return to Sundercliff Village via a shortcut passageway in the northwest corner of the forge; pull the rope to lower the rock wall. Varsa Baalim[edit] The vampires attack the Drothmeri. Now that you've obtained both bezoars, you can proceed to open the door to Varsa Baalim. The entrance is back at the lower level of Sundercliff Commune. Activate each of the two ""Enchanted Pedestals"" by either side of the door to put the bezoars in place; you will then be told that you have dispelled Drothan's barrier. You will first enter an ""Excavated Ruin"", where you can watch a combat between a pair of vampires and a Drothmeri soldier. Other than that, there is little of interest.  Run through to the other side, and open the door to Varsa Baalim proper. As soon as your screen loads, you'll get another quest update, saying that ""there's no telling what I may encounter here...,"" a not-so-subtle warning to be ready for combat. You should see some people fighting below you... more of Drothan's army taking on a handful of vampires. Both groups will gladly attack you given the chance, so you're best off hanging back and letting them do as much damage to each other as possible before joining the fray. Once everyone has been taken care of, take some time to explore this new area, which consists of yet another huge underground cavern, filled with surface-type Ayleid ruin features. There are a couple of doors you can access. Two lead to Cava Arpenia, which is just a small, optional, side area with more vampires, a dead Drothmeri veteran, and one Ayleid cask. The door you really want is for Cava Beldameld, and is located to the west past some very tilted sets of stairs. Cava Beldameld is also small and boring (one vampire), but it leads to a new section of Varsa Baalim. There, you will find more Drothmeri and vampires fighting each other, again. Backtracking to the east of the door to Cava Beldameld you will find a chest and an Ayleid cask with some gold and other loot. Then proceed northward through a maze of ruined walls, eventually angling to the northeast. Keep your eye open for Ayleid casks hidden in a few corners, and also watch out for the never-ending vampire attacks. Your destination is the door to Cava Marspanga where (surprise, surprise) another group of Drothmeri and vampires are battling, along with a dead Drothmeri veteran. Clean them out, collect the loot from the Ayleid casks, and head back up the stairs into yet another section of Varsa Baalim. As an alternative to this method, players with sufficient acrobatics skills will be able to leap onto a halved pillar, then vault over a nearby wall, allowing quick and easy entry to the Nefarivigum without having to clean out two caverns first. You're almost there! Head to your left (northeast) out of the door, up a small ramp of debris that leads you on top of some ruined walls. Stay up there, crossing the platforms and walls, and you will come to a garden-variety Ayleid ruin spiral entrance. This is at last the Nefarivigum, which based on Drothan's journals was his destination and the location of Mehrunes Razor. Nefarivigum[edit] A foreboding descent... The Nefarivigum Continue down the stairs and you'll see Drothan studying a statue. If he hasn't seen you, sneak over to his bedroll and read his field journal to find out what he's learned about retrieving the Razor. There are a few ways events can play out at this point. The basic approach would be to kill Drothan yourself and then to read his diary to figure out what method you find appropriate to get the Razor. One option is to force open the gate leading to the Razor; if your strength is greater than 90, the gate will open. Even if you are not strong enough to open the gate, simply attempting will wake up the champion, Msirae Faythung. The other option is to take the Beating Heart from the champion's chest and eat it, upon which you will gain four Infamy points and contract the diseases Porphyric Hemophilia and Cannibal's Prion. Either way, the champion will wake up and attack; however, he will steadily lose health throughout the fight if you chose to take the heart. Alternatively, you can take the heart and then force the gate. The champion will awaken and still take damage, but you won't get Cannibal's Prion, Porphyric Hemophilia, or the 4 infamy points. Once you have killed the champion, he will vanish along with his weapon (even if you try to pick it up, it will crumble to dust). Another approach involves getting Drothan and the champion to fight each other, allowing you to simply finish off the victor. One way to do this is to sneak over to the gate and attempt to force it open yourself. Regardless of your strength, the champion will awaken and the two will fight, even if you were detected. If your strength is greater than 90, you could take the Razor and leave through the newly revealed door if you do not want any of Drothan's enchanted items. Another option is to sneak over to the champion, steal the heart, back off from the two and eat it. The champion will awaken and fight Drothan. Alternatively, you can steal the heart and force the gate, which will, once again, cause the two to fight each other. If, in any of these situations, Drothan is victorious, the gate will open, yet Drothan will return to studying the statue as if the champion was still there and ignore the now accessible Razor. Regardless of which method you choose, proceed through the door, and pick up the Razor. When you grab the Razor, the back wall drops out revealing a door to the Forgotten Tunnels. The tunnels contain several low-level enemies (rats, mud-crabs). Once you get to the end, there's a submerged door that will pop you back out in Lake Canulus just south of Sundercliff Watch."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:An_Unexpected_Voyage","Sleep on The Bloated Float; you will awaken to find it hijacked. Speak with Lynch about the gang now commandeering the inn and free the bouncer, Graman gro-Marad. Speak with and kill Minx. Speak with and kill Wrath to obtain his key. Make your way to the cabin to find the leader of the gang. Decide whether to kill her or negotiate with her. Negotiate successfully and she'll surrender herself and her sword; Ormil will apprehend her. Rest again in your room: the ship will be back at the dock when you wake up. Speak with Ormil about the gang to receive your reward in gold.","Go to The Bloated Float Inn in the Waterfront district of the Imperial City. Speak to Ormil, the publican, and rent a room for 10 gold. Head below the deck to your new room. Now you must sleep, but before doing so, move the pitcher to find a bag with some gems (see Notes section below). When you wake up, your journal will update to tell you that the Bloated Float has been put out to sea. Lynch[edit] Leave your room and you will immediately run into a bandit named Lynch. Talk to him (the correct options are the bottom of the two responses each time) to obtain some important quest-related information: ""Hey! Who in Oblivion are you? You don't look like one of the Blackwater Brigands!""   ""None of your business""""Intruders are my business. I think instead of locking you in the storage room with the bouncer, I'm going to dump your body overboard."" ""Just a passenger""""What? I was told there are only two others on board. I locked the bouncer in the Storage Room and she has the owner. So that leaves you. Now, I'll ask again. Who are you?""   ""I'm from the City Watch""""City Watch? I doubt it. But since you have aligned yourself with them, I think it's time to put an end to this conversation."" ""I'm a member of your gang""""There's no one else in our group except the four of us. The Blackwater Brigands don't just take on new members out of the clear blue sky. When we formed the Brigands three months ago, I was told no more than a four way split on all the profits! So stop telling lies and tell me what you're doing here!""   ""I'm not going to say""""Then perhaps my sword can find the words that your mouth cannot!"" Red-colored dialogue indicates that the conversation ends with Lynch attacking you. Green-colored dialogue indicates that the conversation continues. Blue-colored dialogue indicates that the conversation either begins or ends there and that no other option exists but that one. You've now learned that the Blackwater Brigands, the gang that has taken over the Bloated Float, are a small group of four that formed three months ago. Moreover, Lynch just told you that their leader is holding the ship's captain hostage, and he himself is guarding the sole other person, the inn's bouncer, in the storage room nearby. Kill Lynch to get the key to the storage room. You'll also find his instructions. Use the key to open the storage room and free the bouncer, Graman gro-Marad. He tells you he can steer the ship back to the city, but that you'll need to clear out the remaining bandits and unlock the top deck for him to do so. Minx[edit] Up the stairs, you'll meet the next bandit, Minx. Talk to her (selecting the bottom dialogue choices again) to learn some more important information regarding the Bloated Float's unexpected departure: ""Ho there! Where do you think you're going! Selene's not going to like this one bit... I wasn't to be disturbed!""   ""I'm getting off this boat.""""The only way you're getting off this boat is when we throw your corpse over the side! Hahahaha!"" ""Lynch sent me up here""""Lynch sent you up here? Why? Did he send you to talk to Selene?""   ""No. He sent me to help you""""You are a liar! Lynch had specific instructions not to disturb me. Since you came from below decks, you must have gotten past Lynch. I swear, you will not get past me!"" ""Yes. I'm to assist her""""What does she need assistance with? She has Ormil under her own watchful eye in his cabin. Something isn't right here. What happened to Lynch?""   ""He's dead""""You? You bested Lynch? I always knew he was out of practice. Oh well, I suppose it's up to me to do his job for him as usual!"" Red-colored dialogue indicates that the conversation ends with Minx attacking you. Green-colored dialogue indicates that the conversation continues. Blue-colored dialogue indicates that the conversation either begins or ends there and that no other option exists but that one. Minx revealed some important information quite by accident: the most useful of it being that Selene, the gang's leader, is holding Ormil hostage in his own cabin. Wrath[edit] Killing Minx will net you the key to the upper deck, so go up the stairs and unlock the door. You will come face to face with the third bandit, Wrath, on the top deck. Talk to him, being sure to choose the bottom dialogue options: ""Wha-- ? What are you doing up here? They find the 'Golden Galleon' yet?""   ""Get away from that wheel!""""Over my dead body!"" ""I'm awaiting orders.""""Orders? Selene didn't tell me about this, and I don't remember her taking on someone else to help us find the Gold Galleon. When did all this happen?""   ""Yesterday""""Liar! We never met yesterday! You're an intruder!"" ""Three days ago""""Damn that woman! She promised a four part split when we recover the 'Golden Galleon'. She never said anything about splitting it five ways! She said when we got back to the safe house in Bravil, we would divide the loot after she fenced the damn thing. Do Lynch and Minx know about this?""   ""Lynch and Minx are dead.""""Well, since they're out of the way, if I kill you, that means Selene and I split the take two ways. This heist is getting better and better!"" Red-colored dialogue indicates that the conversation ends with Wrath attacking you. Green-colored dialogue indicates that the conversation continues. Blue-colored dialogue indicates that the conversation either begins or ends there and that no other option exists but that one. Wrath is perhaps the most conversationally lucrative of Selene's three henchmen, as he tells you that the Brigands took over the ship in order to find a highly valuable ""Golden Galleon"", which they planned to fence upon returning to their safe house in Bravil. Kill Wrath to obtain the key to the captain's cabin where Ormil, the innkeeper, is being held. Head back indoors and tell Graman gro-Marad that the coast is clear. He'll head to the top deck and stand by the wheel, but refuse to return to port until Ormil has been rescued. Selene[edit] Inside the captain's cabin you'll find Selene, the leader and final member of the Blackwater Brigands, holding Ormil hostage. You now have two choices: kill her, or talk her out of fighting by using the information you've learned from the previous bandits. If you decide to kill her, skip to the Reward section below. If you decide to spare her life, you'll need to once more choose the bottom responses when you speak to her. The specific answers to select are bolded and in green below: ""How'd you get in here?""   ""Shut up and release Ormil!""""Ha! Those will be the last words that leave your lips!"" ""I took the key from Wrath""""Wrath? I told him to guard the wheel and not talk to anybody. Who are you?""   ""I'm just the ship's cook""""There's no cook on board the Bloated Float! How dare you try and make a fool of me! After I deal with you, I'll feed your body to the slaughterfish!"" ""I'm here to join the gang""""Hahaha! We made a solemn pact not to let anyone else join the gang. I can remember it clearly even though it was...""   ""... four months ago?""""Wrong, fool. I've grown tired of this guessing game. I've much to do and you're in the way. I aim to rectify that!"" ""... three months ago?""""What? Can no one in this gang keep things secret? I suppose you know why we've taken over the Bloated Float as well!""   ""To ransom your prisoners""""We aren't here for that! My patience is at an end, as will soon be your life!"" ""To find the Golden Galleon""""H—how did you know about that? No matter. Once I've taken care of you, we'll scuttle the ship and be off to our safe house. No one will find us there.""   ""You mean in Cheydinhal?""""Wrong, fetcher! I'm tired of this conversation! Time to end it with steel!"" ""You mean in Bravil?""""A-again you have surprised me with your knowledge of our operation. I suspect Lynch didn't check all the inn rooms before we departed. You must have been hiding down there and made your way up here. How did you get past Minx, Wrath and Lynch?""   ""I've killed all of them""""Impossible! You defeated the three of them alone? I –I'm humbled by your skill, and fear that assaulting you would lead to my own quick demise. Please accept my surrender. Here's my blade. Please. No treasure is worth my life. The Bloated Float is yours."" Red-colored dialogue indicates that the conversation ends with Selene attacking you. Green-colored dialogue indicates that the conversation continues. Blue-colored dialogue indicates that the conversation either begins or ends there and that no other option exists but that one. Once you tell her that they're dead, she'll surrender and hand over her sword, the Blackwater Blade. Talk to Ormil and select the ""Selene"" option; he'll instruct you to escort Selene to a room on the inn deck where she'll be locked up. Alternatively, you can kill Selene and loot the Blackwater Blade from her corpse. Talk to Ormil, and select the ""Selene"" option; he'll tell you he plans to inform the Imperial Watch of her death."

Upon arriving in Chorrol, people on the street may comment: ""I heard Fighters Guild got the Fallen Rock contract, but the guy is just sitting around drinking beer."" ""It's a simple job. Go get a journal from Fallen Rock Cave. Shouldn't that be a cinch for a Fighter Guild contract?"" You may also hear a tragic tale about the local Fighters Guild chapter: ""Vilena is pretty useless since Vitellus died. Thank gods Oreyn is around to keep things together."" When approached in the local guild hall, a sad Vilena Donton will bid you welcome and share a few philosophies, but will also prove the gossipers right and point you towards her second-in-command, Modryn Oreyn, for your next assignment. Modryn turns out to be rather hostile to newcomers, and with good reason. After a few patronizing comments, he will task you with finding Maglir, another new recruit who defaulted on a contract in Skingrad. If You Want It Done Right...[edit] It is possible to follow the map marker to Maglir, but asking around town will net you some information, as well: ""The Bosmer? I've seen him at the West Weald Tavern. Been there for days, from what I hear. Better go see him.""  ""Oh. Him. He's been around. Mostly at the West Weald staring at the bottom of a flagon of ale."" Inside the West Weald Inn, you will find Maglir hanging out in the bar doing absolutely nothing. When approached, he will claim to be underpaid and will explain that he was supposed to pick up Brenus Astis' Journal, which was reported to be in Fallen Rock Cave. In a sign of things to come he will conclude with: ""If you care that much, you go find it. The contract's yours. It's not worth it for what the Guild is paying. I've got a family to think about."" Fallen Rock Cave[edit] It is painfully clear that Maglir is not Fighters Guild material, although Fallen Rock Cave does indeed turn out to be filled to the brim with undead enemies. The diary can easily be reached by following the map marker to the northernmost chamber and then jumping down the pit (see this section for details). Proceed north through the narrow tunnel to a small water-filled room with a minor loot chest in a stone alcove and a dead zombie. The diary is right next to the chest, so pick it up, backtrack to the entrance and decide what to do next. Another Rat Problem[edit] With the diary in hand, you can either travel to Skingrad for another chat with Maglir or go straight to Modryn Oreyn in Chorrol and deliver the diary. Talking to Maglir does not impact this quest, though it will influence events later on. In any case, the cowardly Bosmer will even pretend that he doesn't care whether you tell Modryn the truth, instead proceeding to ramble about his family and the low paycheck. In Chorrol, Modryn Oreyn will be quick to ask you what happened in Skingrad. Even if Maglir seemed indifferent, your answer will affect the More Unfinished Business quest, when Maglir defaults on yet another contract in Bravil. If you choose to rat out on Maglir now, you will receive 1 fame point, but Maglir will not help you in Bravil. If you choose to be loyal to Maglir and lie to Oreyn, you will miss out on the increased fame, but Maglir will help you later on. Regardless of your choice, Modryn will hand you a level-dependent gold reward and express mixed feelings about Maglir. Speaking to him again will net you another contract, namely the quest Drunk and Disorderly."

Upon speaking to the merchants (either Tertullian Verus, Claudette Perrick or Ogier Georick) you will learn of a new merchant in town, Thoronir, whom the other merchants don't trust. They will tell you to speak to Jensine for more information. Unfriendly Competition[edit] Speak with Jensine at Jensine's ""Good as New"" Merchandise in the Imperial City Market District. You will learn that Thoronir is selling goods with an incredibly low markup price compared to other merchants, essentially committing price dumping. Volunteer to help the Society of Concerned Merchants deal with 'Unfriendly Competition' from Thoronir at The Copious Coinpurse. Eavesdrop on a Conversation[edit] Speak with Thoronir in the Copious Coinpurse and learn about his inventory. Wait outside the shop until after 8pm, and then follow Thoronir. He will either wander the city or go drinking in The Merchants Inn for several hours - before eventually making his way to a small garden in the Market District around midnight. Agarmir slips into the garden soon after. Sneak close enough, and you will enter a cutscene. When they have finished talking, follow Agarmir back to his house in the Talos Plaza District. Agarmir's House[edit] Agarmir will lead you to his house, but you will need to wait until he leaves it again to enter and find evidence. He leaves at different times depending upon the day of the week: on the weekend (Loredas and Sundas) he is out from 8am until 8pm; from Morndas to Turdas he leaves just after 4pm and returns after 8pm, and on Fredas he leaves at 5pm for two hours. Once he leaves, pick the lock or pickpocket Agarmir for the key to gain entry to the house. There is another lock to pick to get into the basement, so make sure you have plenty of lockpicks. Take the book called ""Macabre Manifest"". It will be on a table in the basement surrounded by candles. Go back to Thoronir and confront him with the book. He'll claim he didn't know the goods coming from Agarmir were looted from corpses (hence their cheap price) and want to make amends and make sure Agarmir gets caught, and will suggest you go to the Trentius' Family Mausoleum to gather more evidence.

Be very careful not to attack Agarmir or his hireling, Rolgarel, until they have first attacked you. Sneak attacks (or any other crimes) will lead to you getting a bounty, and are very likely to trigger a bug that makes it impossible to finish this quest. Once you have killed them both, collect any loot in the mausoleum. To get out of the mausoleum you need to get the Trentius Mausoleum Key from Agarmir's corpse. To complete the quest, you need to be sure to take the muddy shovel as evidence. In addition, there is some valuable loot (that can be more worthwhile than the quest's official rewards). Agarmir carries a leveled, unique, enchanted sword, Debaser, which drains Willpower and Endurance. Hidden behind the grave of Calliben Trentius is Calliben's Grim Retort, one of the few magic items with guaranteed locations. To reach the mace, jump nearby and grab it as you fall back to the ground, or use the  weak fireball or similar spell to shift it into a position where you can reach it.

Steal the tax records and money from Lex's desk. Return to Armand.","After you've fenced 50 gold's worth of goods, you can meet Armand at midnight behind the Abandoned Shack in the Waterfront District. He Took from the Poor?[edit] Armand will inform you that Hieronymus Lex has recently collected taxes from the poor residents of the Waterfront District, seemingly as both a warning and punishment for them being complicit in assisting the Gray Fox. The Gray Fox wants you to right this wrong by stealing back the money and the tax records from Lex's quarters in the South Watchtower. Steal in, Steal out[edit] Locate the South Watchtower in the Imperial City – either via your map or by asking any of the city's beggars. You can enter the watchtower from either the Temple District or Arboretum District. As a main hub for Imperial guards, this can seem a little daunting when you first enter the Watchtower's main area. Guards will be changing shifts, eating meals, and generally wandering about. The Watchtower consists of four levels: the foyer area where the guards eat, first and second floor sleeping quarters, and finally Lex's private quarters. You need to get all the way up to Lex's quarters undetected. You are allowed to be in the foyer area; however, the guards' sleeping quarters and Lex's private quarters are restricted, and you will be arrested for trespassing if you are caught in these areas (you will be warned and asked to leave first). There are shift changes all day long, but two windows exist when no guards should be present on the ground floor: 9am - 11am and 9pm - 11pm. In practice, the clear times will start about 20-30 minutes later, as guards will be heading back from patrol or guard duty and going upstairs to rest. You need to ensure that you are quick or undetected when accessing the second and third levels; otherwise, you may get arrested for trespassing. Be careful, because guards might also randomly walk into the room with you; hence, it is best to wait until the shift has changed and the guards have all retired. Use whatever additional means necessary for your stealth, such as chameleon or invisibility effects. You will need to pick the lock on the final access ladder to enter Lex's quarters. Be careful not to wake Lex (if he's sleeping) and hope that no one follows you into his room, as you will be arrested on sight. Once you enter Lex's quarters, there is a locked desk immediately to your right which contains what you're looking for: the tax records and the gold. You can take them both, but you only need the tax records. A Subtle Message[edit] Return to Armand at his midnight rendezvous point. He will let you keep the money, since he just ""wanted to let the Watch know they went too far."" You will also receive a promotion to Footpad and 2 Infamy points."

Find and read Lord Jaren's Journal. Discover the castle's secret grotto and kill the inhabitants to claim your prize.","Lord of the Castle[edit] This quest only becomes available once the Fighter's Stronghold plug-in is installed. See the instructions on that page for information. A Message from the Past[edit] In the private quarters, there is an area at the end of the corridor that you can see when entering the room. It contains a central round table with two benches to the right. To the left is a recessed arch sitting atop of two half-pillars. The right one can be triggered, which opens a secret entrance to a small room behind the wall recess. The bookshelf at the opposite side of the room holds Lord Jaren's Journal.  Looking up will reveal a hatch door onto the castle's rooftop. Jaren was the father of Lord Kelvyn, the previous lord of the castle who was killed in the battle you helped to win. In the journal, Jaren reveals the terrible fate of his liege-lord at the hands of the necromancer Arielle Jurard and how he tricked the pair, sealing them inside the castle's grotto. He also lets slip that the entrance is to be found in the training room. It seems he had intended to tell his son about the castle's unwanted tenants but his untimely death (described in Lord Kelvyn's Will) meant he never found the time. Low Spirits[edit] In the castle's training room is an archery butt. Behind that is a candelabrum attached to the wall that, when pulled, will unlock the secret door to the grotto. Follow the winding path to another blank wall with a movable pillar then through this to the grotto itself. Inside, you will find the skeleton Lord Kain and the nether Lich Arielle Jurard. Kain holds the Dragonsword of Lainlyn and Lord Kain's Shield while Jurard owns a key that unlocks a leveled chest hidden underwater against the southwest wall of the main chamber. The Lich also carries a random staff. Three Varla Stones can be found in the upper tier of this room."

Acquire one Black Soul Gem and activate the shrine to give it as an offering. Find Arkved's Tower, and work your way to the Death Quarters. Steal back the orb from Arkved. Return the orb back to the shrine and claim your reward: the Skull of Corruption.","Locating the Shrine of Vaermina[edit] Vaermina's Shrine is located on the shore of Lake Poppad, a short walk southwest of Cheydinhal. The location of this shrine can be marked on your map by any of the following methods: Speaking to Ontus Vanin in the Talos Plaza District after having read Modern Heretics or have spoken with Ulene Hlervu about ""Cheydinhal"". Speaking to Luther Broad, the innkeeper of Luther Broad's Boarding House in the Elven Gardens District about the ""Imperial City"". An Offering to the God[edit] You must be at least level 5 to start this quest. At the shrine, talk to the Dunmer Aymar Douar. You will learn that you need to offer a Black Soul Gem to Vaermina. After you do, Vaermina will say: We meet again, mortal, for we have met before, whether you know it or not. When you mutter in your sleep, you speak to me. When you waken wet with sweat, you've just left my house. I dwell in your dreams; I savor your nightmares. Now, you will serve me. The wizard Arkved has the Orb of Vaermina... snatched from the dreams of my followers and dragged into the waking world. Travel to his tower and retrieve my Orb. Take care, though, mortal. In my Orb, Arkved has found more than he bargained for. The Task at Hand[edit] A nightmare realm, in more ways than one Arkved's Tower is one of the more interesting dungeons in the game. If you are in a hurry, just follow the arrows, fighting all the daedra or using your invisibility spell until you reach Arkved's Death chamber. When you reach the Death Chamber, grab the orb from the small table in the room and leave. Arkved is sleeping, and he will not attack you even if you attack him. There is a trap door which you can use to exit from Arkved's quarters. However, you cannot use it to enter his chambers from the outside, because it does not appear until you have explored the rest of the dungeon (In Oblivion Remastered, the trap door is visible when you arrive at the location and can be entered, skipping the dungeon).  Returning to the Shrine[edit] Return to Vaermina for your reward, the Skull of Corruption. It creates a ""corrupted clone"" of any NPC, inheriting all of their abilities and equipment. The clone will fight the original NPC for you. Vaermina will say the following as her parting words: My Orb is returned, and Arkved will live out the rest of his days in nightmare. It is fitting. You have proved yourself, mortal. It is fitting, as well, that you should bear my token."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Vahtacen%27s_Secret","Talk to Raminus Polus then Irlav Jarol to get your assignment. You are required to check up on the progress of research at Vahtacen, an Ayleid ruin. At Vahtacen, solve a puzzle to gain access to the inner depths of the ruin. Explore the ruin and retrieve an Ayleid artifact. Take the artifact back to Irlav Jarol then report to Raminus Polus for your promotion.","The Arcane University[edit] After being promoted to Evoker (i.e. after completing Ulterior Motives), speak to  Raminus Polus for your next task. Raminus tells you to speak with Irlav Jarol who is in charge of Vahtacen, an Ayleid ruin site that the Mages Guild is exploring to find Ayleid artifacts. Depending on the time of day, Irlav can be found upstairs in the Arch-Mage's Tower or in the lobby with Raminus. Irlav will forward you to Skaleel who is currently in charge of the research at Vahtacen. It seems she has reported that there is a blocked passage. He gives you a key to the ruins and tells you to go to Vahtacen and speak with Skaleel about solving the problem. Unlocking Vahtacen[edit] When you reach Vahtacen, southeast of Cheydinhal, you will find a remarkably empty cave: the first section has been cleaned out by the Mages Guild. At one end of the cave the tunnel breaks through into an underground Ayleid ruin. Here you will find Skaleel, who seems unimpressed by the fact that Irlav sent you to check on things. She tells you that they have found a pillar but cannot figure it out and suggests you try your luck. She warns you however to be careful and cast only basic spells. In the northwest corner of the room, a gate opens with the key Irlav gave you. Down the passageway you'll find the pillar and Denel, another mage. It seems the pillar reacts to having magic cast on it but so far the only result has been that the caster has been zapped back. Denel also mentions tablets in the corners of the room with writing on them. He thinks these markings could be translated if he had an Ayleid reference of some sort and suggests asking Skaleel for one. Around the room containing the pillar are four inscriptions, which read (in clockwise order starting at the door): av molag anyammis av mafre nagaia magicka loria magicka sila To translate these, you will need the Ayleid Reference Ayleid Inscriptions and Their Translations, which Skaleel will provide if you talk to her again. Using the book, Denel will translate the phrases. Give him the book, then speak to him about Translation. You'll find out that the four phrases correspond to: From Fire, Life (Fire Damage) From Frost, Death (Frost Damage) Magicka Darkens or Magicka Wanes (Damage Magicka) Magicka Shines or Magicka Waxes (Fortify Magicka) As you might have guessed from the translation, you have to cast certain spells at the pillar in order to open it. These spells have to be cast at the pillar; either ""on target"" or ""on touch"" - casting spells ""on self"" will not work. The strength of the spells does not matter. Fortunately, if you don't happen to have all these spells, a chest next to Denel has scrolls that let you cast, among other effects, Flare (Fire Damage), Snowball (Frost Damage), Sever Magicka (Damage Magicka), and Elevate Magicka (Fortify Magicka). You can find a scroll that causes the necessary frost damage in the Bruma Mages Guild, or you can buy one from the Skingrad Mages Guild. The scrolls in Vahtacen respawn in the chest after 4 to 5 days if you used them prematurely (you will need to leave Vahtacen for four full days for this to happen). Enchanted arrows and staves with fire damage, frost damage and damage magicka can also be used. As you cast each of the four spells in sequence at the giant pillar in the middle of the room (Fire Damage, Frost Damage, Damage Magicka, Fortify Magicka), portions of the pillar lower to reveal a stairway. If you make a mistake, you will instead get zapped by as many of the Dark Welkynd Stones that can take aim at you. Be cautious, as one zap can kill. If you're worried about being zapped, you can stand out by Denel and take aim with your targeted spells from a safe distance. The Rest of Vahtacen[edit] Speak to Denel or Skaleel once the pillar has opened and they will suggest that you explore the new areas of the ruins. Whether or not you chose to speak to them, proceed down the stairwell into what is a fairly standard Ayleid ruin. There are undead creatures and several traps in this area (for more information, see Vahtacen). You will eventually reach a large room with hanging cages. There is an Ayleid block switch in the southern end of the room - go up the staircase, look to your right and you'll see it. Activating it raises stairs that lead to the center platform. Head up the platform; when you reach the top, a number of level-dependent undead will be released. There is another switch on this platform; activating it raises the cage and reveals an Ancient Elven Helm. Grab it and take it with you. Alternatively, you can climb the stairs to the first push block and then turn to the side (right or left, it doesn't matter which). Go to the side walls of the chamber. You should see a small ledge which runs all the way around the chamber. Climb onto this and walk around it. There are regular gaps which you should be able to jump fairly easily. Eventually you will come to a cage which hangs significantly lower than the others. Jump onto this. If you have high enough Acrobatics, you should be able to jump from this onto the central platform. Press the push block to raise the cage and release the undead. The advantage to this method is that the undead will be unable to reach you as you will not have raised the stairs. Finishing Up[edit] Show the Ancient Elven Helm to Skaleel. She will say that you may have found something very important and urges you to return to the Imperial City so the mages there can take a closer look at it. Return to the Arcane University to find Irlav Jarol and give him the Helm. Finally, report in to Raminus to advance to the rank of Conjurer and receive your leveled Robe of the Conjurer."

Retrieve five empty Grand Soul Gems to get Melisande to help you. Collect a long list of ingredients for the potion. Retrieve the potion, and take it back to Janus Hassildor for a reward.","Getting Started[edit] Before you can start this quest, you must be a full fledged vampire, not just have the disease porphyric hemophilia.  At that point, ""Cure for Vampirism"" will show up as a conversation topic, in particular when talking with healers or with Vicente Valtieri. Asking about ""Cure Vampirism"" will lead to a referral to Raminus Polus at the Arcane University in the Imperial City.  But in fact, Raminus doesn't know much, other than that Count Janus Hassildor of Skingrad is a vampire, and may have been doing some research on a cure.  At Castle Skingrad, ask the Steward Hal-Liurz for an audience with the Count.  Talking to Hassildor yields an interesting backstory on him and his wife and reveals that he will reward you for obtaining a Cure Vampirism potion for his sick wife.  But he tells you of a rumor of an alleged witch of Glenmoril who lives somewhere near the Corbolo River (your map places a marker at Drakelowe.) Melisande's Shopping Lists[edit] RemasteredOblivion The hidden room in Crayfish Steep The hidden room in Crayfish Steep Travel to Drakelowe and you will find one inhabitant, Melisande, who will let on that she might be able to help you.  But before even agreeing to help you, she requires five empty Grand Soul Gems.  At this point in the quest, three empty Grand Soul Gems are placed in nearby dungeons.  In each case, one empty Grand Soul Gem is in a previously nonexistent area of the dungeon; the appearance of the area is triggered by this quest.  The three nearby dungeons are: Crayfish Cave, Zone 4 (Crayfish Steep), behind rock walls I, J, K. Nornal, Zone 2 (Nornal Ageasel), behind hidden door K. Squandered Mine, Zone 3 (Squandered Mine Wind Holes), behind rock wall G. Any other soul gems in the game may also be used for this quest, including stolen ones. There are another 12 guaranteed gems you can use, including one in Melisande's own basement; see Grand Soul Gem for full list of locations. Alternatively, if you are at least level 11, there is small chance (<5%) of finding empty grand soul gems in some dungeon chests. If you are at least level 12, any of the Merchants who sell magical equipment may also stock them. If you have the Wizard's Tower official download, Aurelinwae at the Mystic Emporium will often have the gems. Once you provide Melisande with the soul gems, she will task you with finding a long list of ingredients necessary to make the potion.  Several are regular alchemy ingredients: two shoots of Bloodgrass, six cloves of Garlic, and five leaves of Nightshade.   Full details on where to find these ingredients are provided on the individual ingredient pages.  Two are more difficult to obtain; the blood of an Argonian and the ashes of a powerful vampire. Bloodgrass: This is the tall red grass you see in the Realms of Oblivion and at some Oblivion Gates. It can be bought in some alchemy shops as well, so it is easy to find. A bug may prevent the Bloodgrass from being presented to Melisande. Garlic: Many homes have these lying around on the dinner table or stacked somewhere else. Almost every home in Skingrad has bunches of garlic hanging from a beam in the basement. Nightshade: Nightshade is prolific throughout the West Weald. You can also find some at ""The Main Ingredient"" in the Imperial City Market District, the only alchemy shop guaranteed to have Nightshade in stock.  The Arcane University has several growing there as well. Blood of an Argonian: Melisande gives you a special Enchanted Dagger to use and collect the blood.  You do not need to actually kill the Argonian, just stabbing your victim once with the dagger is sufficient. A complete list of all named Argonians in the game is available at Oblivion-Argonian.  Luckily, there are some easier alternatives: One Argonian (Er-Teeus) can be found at Peryite's shrine; if you have not completed Peryite's quest, he is frozen and there are no consequences to stabbing him. Another possible location is Veyond Cave, which is inhabited by Argonian tribesmen who will attack you on sight. Argonians serve as archers in Marauder bands. The third and the sixteenth combatants in the Arena are another option. If you spared Scar-Tail in The Renegade Shadowscale quest—or have not completed that quest yet—he will still be standing around at Bogwater. The Dark Brotherhood quest Purification requires you to kill everyone at Cheydinhal Sanctuary, including two Argonians, Ocheeva and Teinaava. Ashes of a powerful vampire: This 'powerful' vampire's name is Hindaril. Ask the witch about it and she will mark his location in Redwater Slough on your map.  Killing Hindaril will provide you with Ashes of Hindaril instead of regular Vampire Dust. His home is a nesting ground for vampires. Hindaril can be killed before starting the quest. If you have installed the Wizard's Tower official download, bloodgrass and nightshade can be found in the tower's alchemy garden. Once you deliver all these ingredients to Melisande, she'll tell you to return in 24 hours.  You'll have to go somewhere else and come back, because if you linger inside the house at Drakelowe, Melisande considers it trespassing.  See Notes, below, for tips on waiting to avoid Sun Damage. At last: Potions![edit] RemasteredOblivion Chamber of the Lost Chamber of the Lost When you return, Melisande will have two potions ready. If Melisande's shack is empty when you return, she will be in her basement; just wait a short while and she will reappear near the fireplace, in front of the hidden trapdoor. If she doesn't appear, you might have to wait for a whole day. The Cure for Vampirism Potion, that appears under Potions in your inventory, is for you.  The other one: Vampirism Cure Potion, will appear in the miscellaneous section of your inventory and needs to be taken to Skingrad for Count Hassildor. At Castle Skingrad you again need to work through the Count's steward, Hal-Liurz. Mention the cure to her and she will lead you outside the Hall, to the entrance of the Chamber of the Lost: the Countess' secret chamber.  Count Hassildor is waiting there, as is Melisande. Tell the Count that you have acquired the cure and he will take it. He will allow you to stay and watch provided that you keep quiet.  Melisande wakes up the countess and the Count explains to her that she can end her suffering.  The countess drinks the potion, is healed from vampirism and drops dead on the bed. The Count tells you to let him grieve for 24 hours, then return for your reward. Again, you need to talk to Hal-Liurz to get to the Count. The dialogue ""Reward"" will cause him to give you a level-dependent amount of gold (see below). Reward[edit] Level Reward   1-4 250 Gold   5-9 500 Gold   10-14 1,000 Gold   15-19 2,500 Gold   20-24 5,000 Gold   25-29 7,500 Gold   30+ 10,000 Gold"

Talk to Nerussa, proprietor of the Wawnet Inn in Weye.  Nerussa is seeking some rare, fine wines and she will discuss what she's looking for if you talk to her about ""Wine"".  She will request that you collect six bottles of Shadowbanish Wine, which can be found in some of the old fort ruins around Cyrodiil, and offers to pay handsomely for them. If you happen to find a bottle of Shadowbanish Wine before talking to Nerussa, picking up the bottle will also initiate this quest.  You will be told: I've come across a bottle of wine with markings I've never seen before. I can barely make out ""Shadowbanish Wine"" on the label. It must be quite valuable. I should hold onto it until I find out more. You will need to find Nerussa to learn more. Seeking the Wine of the Year[edit] Shadowbanish Wine was made especially for the Imperial Legion and has some special magical properties not associated with other vintages; namely it doubles as a long-lasting potion of Night-Eye.  The bottles which you are seeking will be located in chests found in eight forts around Cyrodiil.  Each chest contains two bottles of wine, so at least three chests will need to be found. Since they respawn, however, it is possible to get all six bottles from one chest.  The forts are: Fort Aurus — A small fort northeast of Bravil, across the Niben Bay, containing conjurers (quest-related). (map)  Fort Carmala — A small fort south of Chorrol containing vampires (quest-related). (map)  Fort Dirich — A small fort between Skingrad and Chorrol containing undead (quest-related).

Guide the scholar to the shrine within. Return to Azzan for your reward.","Receive the Quest[edit] Speak with Azzan in Anvil, who tells you that Elante of Alinor wishes to study a Daedric shrine and has contacted the Fighters Guild for protection.  Travel to Brittlerock Cave, northwest of Kvatch and due east of Fort Sutch. Elante will be waiting inside. Brittlerock Cave[edit] There are two main ways to proceed now. Speak to Elante and she will begin to walk through the cave. Follow her closely (or stay just far enough ahead of her to be able to react if she turns) and kill any monsters you meet. This is the riskier option as there is a possibility that Elante will be killed. However she can both fight and heal herself, so her death is not inevitable. She will walk slowly until she sees an enemy and then run towards it with weapon drawn, so there is a real danger of her getting in the way of your attacks or spells. Summoning your own ally and/or commanding one of the enemies to help you can also be helpful. For a safer experience, don't speak with Elante at all for the moment. Head straight past her and kill all the enemies in the first zone of the cave. After the zone is clear, return and talk to Elante and she can proceed unharmed. Alternatively, Elante will only move forward if you are within a certain distance from her. Even if you start conversation with her and have her leading the way, just run far enough ahead of her and she will stop, allowing you to clear out the areas ahead. Reward[edit] Elante will stop when she reaches the shrine, which appears to have been dedicated to Molag Bal. Talk to her again and she will tell you that she wishes to stay at the shrine, but you are free to go. She'll also give you 2920, Morning Star (v1) - a Blade skill book. You cannot retrieve the skill book from her corpse: the only way to get it is if she lives. Return to Azzan. If Elante survived, Azzan will give you the standard level-dependent gold reward and one Fame point. If she died, you will receive neither the gold nor the fame. If you have already completed The Fugitives, Azzan will promote you to the rank of Guardian and send you to Modryn Oreyn in Chorrol for your next quest - Trolls of Forsaken Mine.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Wayward_Knight","Ask the local guards about the Oblivion Gate. Enter the gate to Oblivion. Make your way through the caves, and meet Farwil and a fellow knight. Find the Sigil Stone room, and close the gate. Make your way out of the gate and back to the count to receive your reward.","This can be completed as part of the Allies for Bruma section of the Main Quest. Attack on a Gate[edit] The son of Count Cheydinhal, Farwil Indarys, has entered the Oblivion gate with his group of knights called the Knights of the Thorn. Asking the local town guard about Knights of the Thorn reveals that they spend most of their time making up wild stories and drinking at the tavern. In Oblivion[edit] After entering the gate you will find that, unlike most Oblivion gates, this quest takes place in a unique plane of Oblivion. The earliest part of the plane will have you traveling through a series of caves, ending with Farwil plus his one surviving knight, Bremman Senyan, on the other side of the tunnels. However, if your Acrobatics is fairly high, you can leap down the cliff, landing on rocks, and get down there, bypassing the caves entirely. Talking to Farwil activates a rather wild story, while speaking with his companion unveils the real story. Farwil, after failing to go to the town guard for help, has led a losing battle against the daedric forces in this plane, leading to all of the other members of the Knights of the Thorn dying. Bremman and Farwil managed to evade the rest of the daedra at the base of the bridge leading to the sigil keep. They refuse to return through the way they came meaning you will have to destroy the gate to save them. This is followed by a long, unbroken bridge over lava with four random Daedra. It is a good idea to keep Farwil and the enemies away from the edges, as Farwil and his companion both will blindly jump into the lava to chase an already doomed Daedra. All Daedra will be drawn to attack Farwil first, and since he doesn't have much health, protecting him is vital. Tactics for Keeping the Knights Alive[edit] The Sigil Keep (called ""The Chaos Stronghold"") is a typical run with two corridor-ramp areas, eventually leading to the Sigillum Sanguis. Upon entering the Chaos Stronghold, the two knights will go sword-happy and may very well enter the corridors after some Daedra they managed to spot up in the rafters. As you cannot give them commands you will have a particularly hard time saving Farwil from an untimely death. To make matters worse they lack leveled equipment, instead they wear a partial set of steel armor, with a Knights of the Thorn Shield and two different steel weapons. It is also worth noting they have no ranged attacks and will be extremely vulnerable to friendly fire and enemy spell casters. Considering these factors the best strategy for completing this quest with the best possible ending would be to do it at an early level, as at the higher levels they are mismatched in one on one fights against the daedra, let alone the daedric hordes you face. Though it may seem logical at first glance, it is not recommended to try to rush the tower and hope they will last long enough for you to destroy the gate as they will die long before you can reach the top of the sigil keep. Archery is nearly entirely useless in this quest as the tower's cramped hallways and crooked paths make it almost impossible to line up a shot, not to mention the two suicidal lemmings that will charge right at the enemy. Having spells that provide magical shields against damage, 100% Chameleon spells to keep them safe from most damage, and healing spells to help them recover from the many wounds they will sustain throughout the battle are all recommended. You may also benefit from spells or enchantments that boost disposition since they are both melee fighters friendly fire is very likely. Ranged Command Humanoid/Command Creature spells can effectively clear cells with little risk of injury to the party, and Paralyze spells and poisons will also confer more favorable odds. At level 30, friendly fire is a big problem for a strong fighter; a tactic that might help is to soften up but not kill the closest Daedra in a group before moving on to the next enemy. The two knights should lag behind and finish off the opponents without too much trouble, two on one, and this keeps them behind you and out of your way while you do most of the damage. Then they can be healed before moving on to another group. After fighting a group, if your companions are on low health, you can wait (if there are no enemies around) and they will regenerate their health. If your Acrobatics are high enough and you have enough health restoring potions and/or spells it is possible to navigate under the bridge to bypass the daedra and not have to worry about Farwil and his knight being slaughtered in the Sigil Keep. You could also choose to leave the Keep and wait for an hour after every wave of daedra. This will restore your health and magicka, as well your companions'. Alternatively, see the Note below about sneaking past Farwil and assaulting the tower alone. Reward[edit] If Farwil is returned safely, he will make you a Knight of the Thorn. You will receive +2 Fame. Access to the Knights of the Thorn Lodge is also awarded, but there is not much in there. It does have some beds which makes for a decent place to rest. It is probably a bad idea to use the chests and crates to store items because some of them respawn. If you speak to him about the Knights of the Thorn, he will give you a leveled Knights of the Thorn Medallion (Fortify Speechcraft). However, if you neglect to do so, and complete the quest by talking to his father, the medallion will be forfeit. The Count will also offer a reward of one of two magic items - a sword or a staff; only one can be selected. If the sword is chosen, the Count will present Thornblade, a leveled longsword of Disintegrate Armor. The alternative is the Staff of Indarys (leveled Shock Damage and Damage Strength). The Count will also give allies to Bruma. If Farwil dies, you can retrieve his Signet Ring and his Knights of the Thorn Medallion. In this case, you get only +1 Fame and your final reward from the Count will be lessened, as you get just a leveled gold reward (see chart below). Although the Count asks for Farwil's Signet Ring, you do not need to have it to obtain the reward; even if you do have the ring, the Count returns it to you. If you kill Farwil, the quest will fail. Beware, if you do kill Farwil and do not reload, the Count will refuse to talk to you for killing his son, making it impossible to do any previously uncompleted quests involving the Count, such as the Cheydinhal house for sale, or the Allies for Bruma quest. You will also receive +2 Infamy for killing Farwil. Gold Reward[edit] (The leveled gold reward is only if Farwil dies. If he survives, you get one of the weapons described above.) Level Reward   1-4 75 Gold   5-9 150 Gold   10-14 225 Gold   15-19 300 Gold   20-24 375 Gold   25+ 450 Gold"

Upon arrival, Eronor will run to greet you with some bad news: Mythic Dawn agents are attacking the priory. If you attack the agents before Eronor has a chance to speak to you, it will count as an assault - this is difficult to do, however, since Eronor is already outside, waiting for you to arrive and is scripted to come to you even if you are invisible. In the name of the late Prior Maborel, you must kill these assassins with the help of Brother Piner. After they're dead, you'll find that Jauffre has his hands full killing more agents in the chapel.

As he suspected, the amulet has been taken and will need to be recovered. Jauffre suggests taking Martin to Cloud Ruler Temple, a safe haven for the Blades located to the northwest of Bruma. When you arrive, follow Martin as he is welcomed and hailed by the Blades as Emperor Martin Septim, Dragon Born. After Martin gives a speech to the soldiers, he speaks with you about the importance of recovering the Amulet of Kings. Joining the Blades[edit] Jauffre will offer you membership into the Blades. If you accept you will be given an Akaviri Katana and you will have access to all the beds, books, armor, and weapons inside the temple. After you make a decision about membership, Jauffre will give you your next quest. It is not necessary to join the Blades in order to continue with the main quest, nor is this your only chance. If you later change your mind, you can just talk to Jauffre again and choose the topic ""Join the Blades"" — as long as Jauffre is still alive (he can die during the Defense of Bruma or Light the Dragonfires, at which point it becomes impossible to join the Blades) and his disposition towards you is 40 or higher. Cloud Ruler Temple is not the only place made available if you join the Blades. As a chapter-house of the Order of Talos, Weynon Priory will become freely accessible to you if you join."

He was last seen heading for the ruins of Fort Strand to join the marauder gang there. Fort Strand[edit] As soon as you start the quest, Fort Strand is added to your map. Head to the fort, and inside there are approximately nine gang members, along with Bjalfi himself, taking residence. The toughest fight is against Bjalfi and his two companions. It is possible to take them on one at a time assuming you are careful. If you fail to do so and they rush on you all at once, try to distract some of them by summoning a decoy. One of Bjalfi's bodyguards is a boss-level marauder. At low character levels they are pretty easy to defeat, but as you level up it may prove rather difficult.

Velwyn will offer his grandfather's house, Benirus Manor, to you for 5000 gold and says you can take a look at it first. Benirus Manor is located in the east of town, but you need the key to enter, which you will receive only after having bought the house. It is a large, though rather dingy place, but don't worry, as it will be better once you complete the quest. The manor is indeed haunted: sleep in the bed upstairs and you will be rudely awoken by three Benirus Manor Ghosts.  As with all ghosts, they are immune to normal weapons, so be prepared with silver, daedric, or enchanted weapons, or magic.

More Benirus Manor Ghosts appear, and you can put them to rest or just escape the manor; there will be new ones after your return.

Once he arrives, speak with him to learn the sordid details and find out that he feels guilty selling you the place. Make sure you have the piece of Lorgren Benirus' diary with you. His disposition must be raised to at least 60, otherwise he just says ""Sorry. But how is this my problem?"" He agrees to meet you back at The Count's Arms in Anvil to help you lift the curse.

In it, you'll find the  Tome of Unlife (worth 350 gold).  In the open sarcophagus at the south end are a Weak Potion of Healing and a Sack containing a leveled piece of enchanted jewelry (plus four gems and an unenchanted ring).

(Optional) Convince the remaining guests that you are not the killer. Return to Ocheeva for the reward.","The Night Mother's Child[edit] The mini-quest to get your next contract from Ocheeva is titled ""The Night Mother's Child"". You will be directed to Skingrad to meet Fafnir, a Dark Brotherhood assassin posing as a doorman for a house party in Summitmist Manor. He'll provide you a key and some details on the party. Once you enter the manor, you will not be allowed to leave until the contract is fulfilled. Your objective is to kill everyone within Summitmist Manor, while the other guests are under the impression they have to look for a treasure. In order to get your bonus, you must not be observed/suspected by the remaining guests. All of the guests have a tiny amount of health, making them easy kills. When you have finished, return to Ocheeva for your reward of up to 600 gold (level dependent), and if you have achieved it, a bonus of the Night Mother's Blessing: a permanent +2 to your Marksman, Security, Sneak, Acrobatics and Blade skills. Playing with your Victims[edit] While Gogron gro-Bolmog might applaud such brutal efficiency, it's certainly more fun to be creative. An interesting method to achieve your goal is the manipulation of your targets. As some of your Dark Brotherhood companions will tell you before you execute the contract, your (possible) reward from Bad Medicine, The Deceiver's Finery, will come in handy during this contract, as it provides a nice boost to personality and speechcraft. Raise each target's disposition high enough (70 or more) and you'll eventually be able to gain their trust, meaning that they will suspect you the least, if at all. This relationship will prove beneficial in disposing of them. Also try lowering the disposition of the guests; they will begin to suspect you as the killer. Depending on their respective aggressiveness, they may even attack you. Note that if the last guest fingers you as the killer, this does not forfeit the bonus. Execute the quest under the parameters of ""undetected"" and you will still receive the Night Mother's Blessing. Snipe from across the room with your bow. Use poisoned apples, which can be purchased from M'raaj-Dar in the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. Only Nels cannot be killed this way. If you don't feel like taking the time to raise their dispositions, an alternative method of getting them to do your dirty work is to use Frenzy and watch them kill each other. If you opt to bribe the guests, you can recover all of your money from their corpses at the conclusion of the quest. If you equip the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal with low personality or fame, the guests may attack you. If you kill them with this method, you won't lose your bonus. Guest Details[edit] Dovesi Dran: Talk to Primo about her. He'll tell you that he rather likes her, and asks you to ""put in a good word"" for him. Go to her, and if you have raised her disposition, she will confide in you that she is attracted to Primo, also. Tell her that he said for her to wait for him in his room. She will run off excitedly to his room, at which point she will be isolated and a prime target. After one of the guests has died, she will give you the option to say a few things to assuage her fears of being killed, one of which is the familiar [Say Nothing]. If you choose this, she goes down to the basement alone and sits on a stool facing the wall, making herself easy pickings. She dislikes Matilde (accurately accusing her of being racist). If she is the last one you leave alive, she will beg for her life, unless her disposition is raised high (in which case she will try to enlist you to help her escape). She doesn't understand why people call Nels naughty. She thinks he seems nice. With a high disposition she can be turned against the 'second to last' victim, including Primo. Matilde Petit claims to be a Breton aristocrat. She will greet you when you walk in; tell her that you're an assassin to earn a disposition bonus, as she will view your reply as a grand joke, even if you're wearing the Shrouded Armor and have a knife in your hand. Wait a while and she'll offer to work with you to find the treasure. You will be able to send her to the basement, where she will be alone and prime for killing. Matilde doesn't like Dovesi because she's Dunmer, and is disgusted by Nels because he told her ""the most off-color joke about an Argonian maid"". She is more fond of Neville and Primo. If she and Dovesi are the last two alive and her disposition towards you is high, she'll attempt to kill Dovesi. Nels the Naughty likes to drink. He stands in the same spot all the time, and is an easy target when no other guests are present. He likes Dovesi because she reminds him of his late daughter. He doesn't dislike Primo, but Nels will begin to suspect him earlier on in the quest. He dislikes Neville because the Imperial Legion refused to help him and his fellow villagers when they were attacked by bandits in Solstheim, leading to the death of his daughter Olga. If he and Neville are the last two alive, Nels will likely pick up any nearby weapon and attempt to kill him. Also, if you have raised his disposition high enough, he will attack Matilde if he and she are the last two guests left. If he's the last one alive, he will head for the basement. If Nels and Dovesi are the last two alive, and you have a high disposition with Nels, he will choose to believe that the attacker must be coming in through the window rather than believe that you or Dovesi could be the killers. Dovesi has no such inhibitions about killing Nels however... Nels can also be convinced to kill Primo if they are the last two alive. Nels is the only guest who, even with maxed disposition, will still recognize you as the murderer if you killed all the other guests yourself. He also appears to be unique in that he fits Primo's description of him, that behind the drunkard he is hard and calculating. He is the only guest who realizes, relatively early, that there is an assassin sent to kill them and not a greedy guest. Neville is the soldier type. He sleeps long and soundly. He hates Nels and sees Primo as bored. If he and Nels are the last two alive, he'll head to his room to retrieve his gear so that he may try to kill Nels (disposition of 70 required to persuade Neville to attack Nels). He pities Matilde and her loss of income, and thinks that Dovesi doesn't like him, which is true. If Neville is the last one left alive and your disposition is high enough when you talk to him, he says that he will find an axe and try to chop down the door. It is during his attempt to break down the door that he is most easily killed. If his disposition is low however and he is the last one alongside you, he will conclude you are the assassin and attack you. Even equipped in his Imperial Legion armor, he is laughably easy to kill, as he has only 1 hitpoint. Him figuring you out as the murderer does not affect your bonus either. Primo Antonius is an Imperial from a wealthy family. He sits around the ground floor most of the time. He doesn't believe that Matilde is really an aristocrat, and is attracted to Dovesi. He views Nels as the tragic drunk and Neville as the typical greedy soldier. If Primo and either Dovesi, Neville, Nels, or Matilde are the last two left alive, talk to Primo and he'll attempt to kill the remaining guest (assuming your disposition towards him is high enough). Each Guest's Opinions[edit] Here is a brief summary of what each guest feels about the others. Dovesi is attracted to Primo, likes Nels, doesn't like Neville, and hates Matilde. Matilde likes Primo and Neville, and dislikes Dovesi and Nels. Nels likes Dovesi, doesn't like or dislike Primo, dislikes Matilde, and hates Neville. Neville likes Dovesi and Matilde, views Primo as bored, and hates Nels. Primo is attracted to Dovesi, and doesn't like or dislike Nels and Neville and hates Matilde."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Whom_Gods_Annoy","Asking or listening around Leyawiin will soon enough produce the topic about Rosentia Gallenus. Head over to Rosentia's house to discover what's been causing such strange rumors. After you've been brought up-to-date by Rosentia, agree to help her with the problem. First you must head to the Mages Guild and seek out Alves Uvenim whom Rosentia says will know what to do. Upon speaking with Alves, take the Staff and your new friends and head over to Darkfathom Cave. Make your way to the bottom of the cave, honing your skills on any undesirables you may encounter. Once you've reached the hidden Shrine to Sheogorath you'll be prompted to drop the Staff and leave the curse for another adventurer. Head back to Rosentia's and inform her the task is complete, she rewards you with the leveled Ring of Eidolon's Edge.","It Smells Fishy, but It Ain't Sticks[edit] Rumors in Leyawiin indicate that there are strange animal noises coming from the house of Rosentia Gallenus. Upon entering her home, you will immediately find four 'Everscamps' hissing around the house. These are really just regular scamps that don't attack or do anything else other than hiss at you and have a different name. Rosentia tells you she has bought a Daedric staff recently and that is what's causing the trouble. She translated and read the ""nonsense"" word written onto the staff in runes, thus summoning the Everscamps. Now she is unable to get rid of the staff or the scamps. The scamps are not harming anyone and, if attacked, are easy to kill. However, they will reappear shortly thereafter. Rosentia will then send you over to the Leyawiin Mages Guild to talk to Alves Uvenim, whom she says will be able to help her get rid of the scamps. Daedric Prince of Irritability[edit] RemasteredOblivion The hidden Altar of Sheogorath, long forgotten in the depths of Cyrodiil The hidden Altar of Sheogorath, long forgotten in the depths of Cyrodiil Alves tells you that someone needs to take the Staff to the bottom of Darkfathom Cave and leave it at an altar. Easy enough—except that the Staff has a nasty little enchantment that slows you way down (by 20 points—not to mention being trailed by four Everscamps). So get some Potions to bump your speed. Otherwise the fights in the cave will be very difficult. Head to the cave, located to the immediate east of the city. Once inside, proceed with caution, and take out any enemies encountered. Be warned that the scamps can get quite annoying by blocking your way and also lowering your frame rate. At the end of the cave you will find a large altar to Sheogorath that has been long forgotten by the ages. At this point you will get a message stating that you are no longer compelled to hold onto the staff. Approach the altar, bring up your inventory and drop the staff. A message will come up saying that you have finished the quest. Return to Rosentia's house and she will thank you and reward you with the Ring of Eidolon's Edge. This is a ring that grants a level-dependent constant bonus to both blade and block. A Slightly Easier Method[edit] When Rosentia asks whether you are ready to undertake the task, say ""Not yet."" Go to Darkfathom Cave and kill all the critters in it. Travel back to town and tell Rosentia that you are now ready to get rid of the Staff for her. Then travel back to Darkfathom, stroll through the empty cave, and drop the staff near the altar to Sheogorath. However, if you wait more than three days before returning to the cave all the creatures will respawn and you will have to kill them again. Another option is to just sneak your way through the cave, drop the staff and sneak out again (provided you have the skill/gear needed to stay undetected). The presence of the scamps exacerbates the difficulty of this option, as they will follow you regardless of sneaking and may provoke fights with the other denizens of the cave."

Explore Beldaburo until you encounter a locked door protected by powerful magic. Report back to Ilav Dralgoner.","A Loss of Faith[edit] You can start this quest by asking about Rumors. You will be directed to Ilav Dralgoner, a priest of Akatosh on the road leading up to Kvatch. Alternatively, you can start this quest by speaking to Ilav directly and asking him about Hope. Ilav will reveal that he is not just a priest, but a representative of the Order of the Hour. He then explains that people have been disappearing near Anvil, and tasks you with investigating the nearby ruins of Beldaburo. To Beldaburo[edit] Beldaburo is an Ayleid ruin found north of Crowhaven, near the coast of the Abecean Sea. Although usually a conjurer dungeon, the interior will be crawling with undead when you enter. You will need to proceed through the first zone until you reach the door to the lower level, Beldaburo Anga. The door is locked and cannot be picked, and your journal will inform you that powerful magic is preventing you from going any further. Indeed, the door will be glowing with shimmering beams of blue and orange light, usually a telltale sign of time magic. Return to Ilav to report your findings and complete the quest. Due to a bug with the next quest (which will start automatically during the following conversation) you'll probably want to ensure you dismount your horse (if mounted) before talking to him. He will recognize the magical barrier to be the result of a Time Wound, which he suspects is related to an Elder Scroll that had previously been stolen from his Order. This will begin the next quest, Saving Time Itself."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Zero_Visibility","Enter the Aleswell Inn and find the invisible innkeeper, Diram Serethi. Explore nearby Fort Caractacus until you find Ancotar, the wizard in question. Ancotar will give you a scroll to undo the invisibility curse. Keep talking to him (raising his disposition, if necessary) until he gives you a ring. Equip the ring and read the scroll in the center of town. Speak with Diram once more.","Finding Aleswell[edit] North of the Imperial City, the Red Ring Road runs east to west on the northern side of Lake Rumare. Aleswell lies on the south edge of the roadway, north northwest of the Imperial City, on a promontory that overlooks the Lake. It is a small hamlet with an inn, two houses, a garden, and a sheep pen. Aleswell appears deserted. However, the town's few inhabitants are present, albeit invisible, so you cannot steal with impunity. Either enter the Aleswell Inn straight away—the innkeeper, Diram Serethi, will approach from your right—or find an invisible townsperson, who will then direct you to the inn. Nobody is sure exactly what happened, but Diram suspects a wizard in nearby Fort Caractacus is responsible, given his previous experimental activity to the detriment of peace in Aleswell. It is also possible to start this quest by talking to Malene at the Roxey Inn. Once you have started the quest, the quest marker will point to Diram's location, making it easier to find him. Fort Caractacus[edit] Fort Caractacus is a very short distance back down the hill south and slightly east (towards the Imperial City but on the same side of the water as Aleswell). Watch out on the way to the fort because you are likely to encounter invisible creatures in the area. The creatures are leveled—rats, wolves, timber wolves, black bears, and mountain lions all may be encountered. It is strongly advised that you use Detect Life. Ancotar will be present in the exterior ruins, and in fact will yell at you if he sees you. He may often be found in one of the small rooms on the second level. He initially dismisses you with the comment that he ""doesn't want whatever it is you're selling."" Keep trying, and he will eventually become resigned to the fact that you're going to have a chat, whether he wants to or not. Ancotar's Spell[edit] Ancotar takes pride in his spellcraft, and talks about it at length. When he stops himself from talking about the intricacies of his research, you might reassure him that you're interested (even if you're not), although characters in good standing with the Mages Guild will not have to choose the ""friendly"" dialogue options to get everything needed from him. Otherwise, you will have to raise his disposition to at least 71. After he gives you the spell, note that he has not been entirely forthcoming about the spell's potential side effects. Keep talking to him about the scroll he has given you until he gives you Ancotar's Ring of Protection. Before you leave, you may want to pick up two skill books from under Ancotar's desk on the second level of the fort's exterior: The Doors of Oblivion and Mystery of Talara, v4, which train Conjuration and Illusion respectively. RemasteredOblivion Your room at the inn Your room at the inn Read with caution[edit] Equip Ancotar's Ring of Protection and read the scroll in the center of Aleswell. Visit the Aleswell Inn again and Diram will talk to you once more. You will be rewarded with a Fame point and free lodging at Aleswell for the remainder of the game. This room can be used as a makeshift house as the drawers in the room are safe to store items in. Failing to wear the ring when you read the scroll will cause your character to suffer 50 points of Damage Luck. Effects such as Resist Magic and Spell Absorption may reduce the damage. If your Luck was damaged, it can be restored by visiting a chapel altar or wayshrine, or by using Restore Luck spells, scrolls, or potions. With the Vile Lair official download installed, infamous characters can instead visit Deepscorn Shrine. If you fail to use the scroll in the center of Aleswell, you may return to Ancotar and he will give you a second one. However, if you fail to use this one correctly, he will refuse to give you any more and the residents of Aleswell will stay permanently invisible, and you will effectively fail this quest. If you cast the spell while you are near Ancotar, he will become visible, albeit more than slightly angry. If it was your first scroll, he will still give you the second one."

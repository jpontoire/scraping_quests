https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Fresh_Off_The_Bus,Main,"A mysterious, disembodied woman spoke to you and told you to follow this little robot into town. That seems like the best course of action, for now.","Fresh Off The Bus Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Follow Claptrap into Fyrestone.
Strategy[]
Stepping off the bus leaves newcomers at an entrance to Fyrestone with only a single low-quality gun for possessions. Speak to the Claptrap to obtain a HUD, and an ECHO communications device, then follow it to the New-U Station. Using the console after demonstrating the New-U, the Claptrap rolls towards the north gate of Fyrestone. Rather than following him, give the area a thorough search for money, ammo and guns.
Any object with a green light can be searched, but around this area, usually only the dumpsters have a chance of holding new guns. Red chests, on the other hand, always hold weapons (or at least Grenade Mods and/or shields). The game's first red chest is on the roof of the hotel, and there are several ways to reach it. The easiest way is to jump from the generator on the hotel's south porch directly to the roof. The chest typically offers two new guns, both of which are probably more powerful than the default weapon carried by new characters.
After stocking up on any available guns, ammunition and cash, meet up with the Claptrap again at the Fyrestone gates, where it opens the door just as a bandit raiding party bursts into town. The ruins of the town often provide effective cover. This reduces the number of shots sustained from enemy weapons fire. Return fire striking the heads of the bandits will result in a critical hit that amplifies the damage that they sustain and helps to eliminate them quickly.
After first wave of five or six bandits is killed, the Claptrap stops at another red chest containing a fixed set of Repeater Pistols. When playing alone, or in a two or three player party, the chest will only yield two repeaters: a Torgue and a Hyperion. When playing with a full four person party, the chest will contain four pistols. These basic handguns provide a good opportunity to see each manufacturer's specialty: The Torgue deals extra damage, the Hyperion has superior accuracy, the Vladof has a faster fire rate and the S&S Munitions offers an extended magazine. Even if they aren't particularly useful they can still be picked up to sell later on.
Progressing further into town draws the attention of the last bandits in the main street. Killing the final bandit completes the mission.
Completion[]
You followed Claptrap into Fyrestone, and soon found yourself in a firefight with the local bandits. If you can find a survivor, maybe he'll be able to help you on your way to finding the Vault.",Borderlands
https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/The_Doctor_Is_In,Main,"""I thought I was a goner that time! Damn bandits won't leave us alone. Had to lock the place up tight, and now the damn door won't open. Blasted circuits are on the fritz again. Give it a go from the switch out there, would ya?""","The Doctor Is In Video Walkthrough
Objectives[]
Open Building 03 in Fyrestone, and meet Dr. Zed.
Building 03 open
Dr. Zed talked to
Strategy[]
Once the raiders attacking Fyrestone have been defeated, the Claptrap will lead the way to the house of Dr. Zed. Dr. Zed will speak over the intercom to say, ""The circuits are on the fritz again"" and that the door must be opened from the outside. After pressing the switch on the right side of the larger door, it will open, and a cut-scene of Dr. Zed standing over a body on an operating table will play. Talking to him completes the mission.
Completion[]
""Thanks fer openin' her up again. Name's Zed. They still call me 'doctor', even though they don't let me cut on folks anymore. I keep the med vendors 'round here up and runnin'. From the vendors you can buy all the healin' you could ever want from a real doc.""",Borderlands
https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Claptrap_Rescue,Main,"""Claptrap has been shot by the bandits, but the damage looks minor. Perform a quick diagnostic, then see if you can find a Repair Kit somewhere in Fyrestone. You might be able to revive him.""","Claptrap Rescue Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Perform a diagnostic on Claptrap, then find the Repair Kit and repair him.
Diagnostic performed
Repair Kit
Strategy[]
On the way to the gate, Claptrap will be assaulted by a group of bandits, who then vault over the wall and attack. Claptrap is severely damaged in the attack and the Guardian Angel asks that the Claptrap be repaired. The mission marker then indicates a table next to a building where the repair kit is sitting, and the kit is to be brought back to the little robot.
Completion[]
""Once you've tightened a few screws, replaced some burnt wiring, and judiciously applied a little duct tape, Claptrap is rolling once again.""",Borderlands
https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Skags_At_The_Gate,Main,"""Outside of Fyrestone, just past the gate and across the road, you'll find several skag dens. A skag is a vicious four-legged creature, and they'll eat anything, including you. I wanna know if you can handle yourself in a fight against some of these beasts, so head on out there and kill some of 'em for me. If you're still in one piece, then c'mon back.""","Skags At The Gate Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Kill 5 skags and return to Dr. Zed.
Skags killed: 0/5
Strategy[]
Skags can be found just outside the gate. The nearest skag den is just across the road, and houses five skags, enough to complete the mission. There are also more dens up the slopes in either direction, as well as down the road to the east.
Shooting skags in the mouth (this is easiest while they roar, or during certain attacks where they may pounce with their mouths open) allows for a critical hit to be scored, dealing amplified damage. Some caution is advised among packs of skags, as they can inflict high melee damage.
Completion[]
""I guess those skags didn't give you much trouble, eh? You clearly know how to handle a gun. That's good, real good. You're gonna need it, 'cause I've got somethin' else for you to help me with.""",Borderlands
https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Fix%27er_Upper,Main,"""If you're gonna head out of town, you need a shield. A shield forms an invisible barrier around you that absorbs damage. Normally, you'd buy one from the med vendor here, but this one took a bullet during the bandit raid. Fortunately, it just needs a new Power Coupling, and it so happens there's an old vendor we can use for parts. It's right outside of town, down the road east. Go grab the part, install it into the med vendor, and buy yourself a shield.""","Fix'er Upper Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Obtain a Power Coupling, repair the med vendor, and buy a shield.
Power Coupling
Med Vendor repaired
Shield purchased
Strategy[]
To find the Power Coupling, head out of the gate that leads outside of Fyrestone and turn left to avoid another skag confrontation near the Skag den opposite the gate. Further along the path is a small shack with more skags to fight nearby. The power coupling is attached to a broken med vendor beside the shack.
When the power coupling is retrieved, head back to Dr. Zed's building and use the power coupling to repair the vending machine. The vending machine can now be used to buy and sell items, including shields. The Item Of The Day will be a shield as well, and may be a preferable choice of purchase if the funds are available. The freshly bought shield will automatically equip and Dr. Zed will then be ready to offer the mission reward.
Completion[]
""See? You don't need a PhD to do my job. I guess people just feel more comfortable with my honest face and bedside manner. Feel free to sell your items at the med vendor and buy some First Aid Kits for later.""",Borderlands

Objectives[]
Kill bandits and return to Dr. Zed.
Bandits killed: 0/8
Strategy[]
Dr. Zed states that his actions are being monitored by some of Nine-Toes' thugs. He wants them eliminated. Follow the mission marker outside of Fyrestone and cross the road where there's a small outpost to the west. Only 8 Bandits need to be killed to complete the objective, however it does not take much more effort to kill the rest and loot the camp, which contains a red chest. Once completed, return to Zed and talk to him to complete the mission.
Completion[]
""Well done, friend. Here's the bounty for those guys. By the time Nine-Toes realizes we've taken out his eyes, we'll already be making our next move.""

Objectives[]
Recover the stolen food items and return to T.K. Baha.
Stolen Food: 0/4
Strategy[]
T.K. says that the skags have made off with his food and he won't talk until he gets it back. The mission marker leads to the west of T.K.'s farm where there are numerous many skag dens. The mission markers indicate each piece of food, most of which are within range of nearby skags. Once the fourth piece of food has been collected, the mission can be turned in to T.K.

It so happens that I stashed one of her favorite guns behind the grave marker. Use it to kill Nine-Toes. She would've wanted it that way.""","Nine-Toes Take Him Down Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Destroy the barricade, enter Skag Gully, and kill Nine-Toes.
Barricade destroyed
Gun stash found
Nine-Toes killed
Nine-Toes[]
Upon dropping into the pit (see Map2) the fight with Nine-Toes will begin. Nine-Toes is equipped with an average shield, and has about the same amount of health as a Bruiser. Once Nine-Toes' shield is depleted and he begins taking health damage, his two pet Skags are released. Use the pillars as cover. Depleting  Nine-Toes' health in a single shot will prevent Pinky and Digit from spawning.
Incendiary damage is highly effective against not only Nine Toes himself, but Pinky and Digit as well. If no incendiary weapons are available, it may help to kill Nine-Toes first, pick up The Clipper and equip that for use against his pets.
It should be noted that a solid Sniper Rifle will kill him in 2-3 headshots, although this may be difficult due to Pinky and Digit being on the field.
Once Nine-Toes is dead, the elevator will work again, even if the skags are still alive. If Nine-Toes can be killed quickly, fleeing the arena to recover and come back for the skags becomes an option.
Strategy[]
T.K. Baha explains that Nine-Toes is in Skag Gully but he barricaded the nearest entrance. Follow the mission marker to the east where a charge is rigged to blow up the wall (see Map1). Detonate it and head into Skag Gully. Follow the mission marker under a rock bridge and then to the right where TK's wife is buried. Check her grave to find the Lady Finger and a class specific weapon. In playthrough 2, the weapons stash may hold an Eridian weapon. Continue south into Nine-Toes' lair. Stock up on ammo and supplies at the save point. A med kit will come in handy here.
The strategy for playing various classes is different:
Hunter: Move right or left and take the high ground after using Bloodwing on him. Wait for the skags to come out and shoot them when their mouths are open. Finish off Nine-Toes with a critical shot or several body shots. Try for critical shots as often as possible. The new Lady Finger works well due to its ability to double critical damage. A sniper rifle may work better than the Lady Finger for long distance critical hits.
Siren: If she has an SMG equipped, and is at least level 5, phase-walking behind nine toes and striking him from phasewalk is effective. Finish him with an SMG.
Soldier: Immediately run up to Nine-Toes and spray him with rifle fire. It is easier to take out his pet skags after he is dead by taking cover and shooting. The Scorpio Turret is invaluable in this fight.
Berserker: Berserk straight at Nine Toes, aim for the face. Afterwards, use normal anti-skag tactics for his pets.
Completion[]
""Huh? Who's there?! Oh, it's you again. So you actually pulled it off! Nine-Toes is dead. That'll piss off his boss Sledge for sure. Oh, if only my wife were here now. If only I could remember her name. So lonely...""",Borderlands
https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Nine-Toes:_Time_To_Collect,Main,"""Good job killin’ Nine-toes, but I sure as hell ain’t gonna pay you for it. You'll want to go back to Zed in Fyrestone. He oughta have a big ol’ payday for you, seein’ as you did his dirty work and saved his ass.""","Nine Toes Time To Collect Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Go to Dr. Zed in Fyrestone and collect your reward.
Returned to Zed
Strategy[]
This missions is effectively just a short road trip to navigate out of Skag Gully, and return to Dr. Zed in Fyrestone.
Completion[]
""You did Fyrestone a great service by eliminating Nine-Toes, and this reward is well-deserved. Unfortunately, he was just a cog in the machine. The real problem is his boss, Sledge.""

Catch-A-Ride used

Travel to the Catch-A-Ride station, across the road right outside of Fyrestone. Scooter mentions that it's broken. Examine it to finish the mission. Characters may need to be positioned very close to this terminal to activate mission completion.

Get the Digistruct Module back from them and reinstall it into this station.""","Bone Head's Theft Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Get the Digistruct Module from Bone Head.
Bone Head killed
Digistruct Module
Strategy[]
Scooter reports that the Digistruct Module is missing from the Catch-A-Ride and it won't work without it. He suspects Bone Head and his gang took it. Travel down the road north west to Bone Head's outpost. It is situated behind Fyrestone, separated by fences and hills.
Bone Head and his gang can be pretty tough. It is recommended that some side missions be completed before doing this mission. The safest approach is to shoot at Bone Head from inside Fyrestone. To the right of the building with the weapons and ammo machines is a red sign with a big red X on it. Behind that sign is a small boulder offering a jump onto a larger bolder. From there Bone Head can be targeted from relative safety.
For a more confrontational approach, turn right out the gate and take the first path to the right. Stay near the end of this path without entering Bone Head's camp, and Bone Head will spawn without his gang, though when the Vault Hunters get close, his group will spawn and immediately become aggressive.
Bone Head is armed with the Bone Shredder, a unique SMG that fires two rounds at a time instead of one. He is also capable of using melee, in which he'll backflip kick the Vault Hunter near him. It's best to avoid getting up close because it deals an unusually high amount of damage.
There are also a few ramps inside the camp to seek cover while dealing with Bone Head and/or his gang.
Loot the camp and then pick up the Digistruct Module in a chest next to the larger building. Return to the Catch-A-Ride and complete the mission.

Objectives[]
Jump over Piss Wash gully and open the bandits' gate.

Strategy[]
The approach to jump the Piss Wash is to take a Runner to the area west of T.K.'s farm where a ramp awaits. The afterburners are then needed to cross the gap and these should be activated once the Runner is on the ramp. Once on the other side, a mission marker indicates the location of a small bandit sentry post and a gate. Opening the gate completes the mission.

The place is locked down tight. If there's any way to get inside, Shep Sanders knows it. He was a foreman for Dahl until they pulled out and left him here. You'll find him near the crossroads, keeping an eye on the bandits.""","Sledge Meet Shep Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Talk to Shep Sanders near the crossroads.
Shep Sanders met
Strategy[]
This mission is given by Dr. Zed in Fyrestone. He states that Shep is a good friend of his, whose parents had been skinned and their hides made into a tent, by Sledge.
Shep is found at Outpost: Arid Hills, indicated by a mission marker and quickly reached by road. He is leaning up against a wall to the left of a vending machine. After he is spoken to, several new missions, both storyline and side mission, will be available.
Completion[]

https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Sledge:_The_Mine_Key,Main,"""You want to kick Sledge out of Headstone Mine, huh? Good for you. I think you're crazy, but I'll give you a hand. You need the key. Last I checked, there was one down in the Zephyr Substation office. Of course, the bandits aren't going to make it easy for you.""","Sledge The Mine Key Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Go to Zephyr Substation and get the Mine Key.
Mine Gate Key
Strategy[]
Follow the way point marker to Zephyr Substation and take out any bandits. After clearing the bandits, enter the site office to find the key absent and a note left in its place. Take the note to complete the mission.
There is an enemy on top of the site office roof who will be able to shoot through the hole in the roof, if not dealt with before the building has been entered. Once the roof is clear, access to the roof can be gained by jumping onto a rail near some machines inside and using that as a jump point to reach the roof. More loot can be found above.
Completion[]
""Instead of a key, you've found a note that was left in its place. Years of accumulated dust suggest that the key won't be returned anytime soon. You'll need to look for it elsewhere.""",Borderlands
https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Sledge:_To_The_Safe_House,Main,"""The note you found suggests that the Mine Gate Key can be found at Sledge's Safe House to the north.""","Sledge To The Safe House Video walkthrough

Objectives[]
Obtain the Mine Gate Key and take it to Headstone Mine.
Mine Gate Key
Strategy[]
Once the mission has been accepted, the next step is to take the transition into the Arid Hills. A number of skags a short distance beyond the transition will present the first obstacle and several groups of bandits beyond them also bar the way. Sledge's Safe House lies to the north beyond several of these encounters.
Sledge's Safe House is a sprawling interior zone with a large circular room at the end where a boss battle takes place.
Medical and ammunition Vending Machines just inside the door provide the last point of sale before moving through this area. Further supplies must be gained from drops or chests beyond the first few fights.
Part of the way through the building a disabled Claptrap can be found, which will offer the mission Claptrap Rescue: Safe House. The quickest way to handle this side mission is to reach the robot through a barred opening before heading up the ramp to the next stage, thus avoiding the need to double back for the Repair Kit in the room directly above. It is worth doing this immediately due to the Backpack SDU reward, as well as the remote location of this Claptrap rescue.
The rest of the area is swarming with bandit encounters of all types. Badass Psychos can prove to be troublesome in games with higher player counts when they charge into melee, leaving limited evasive options in the confined space of this area. There are also several set piece battles, including one where a siren heralds the approach of a pack of Mutant Midget Psychos, and another where the final boss, Roid Rage Psycho will attack in conjunction with a small horde of midgets. The Roid Rage Psycho is the game's first humanoid opponent with boss-level health, having close to 4 times the health of a Bruiser or twice the health of a Badass Bruiser. Additionally, his metal helmet provides slight damage reduction to headshots.
The conventional strategy for the boss battle is to keep running, killing the midgets first and taking shots at the Roid Rage Psycho whenever practical. He will charge in to melee and will also throw MIRV or Bouncing Betty grenades, thus emphasizing the need to stay mobile. Killed Vault hunters will respawn away from the arena and may have the opportunity to re-engage without having to drop into the pit, although this generally requires being able to shoot past the fence rather than through it.
The Roid Rage Psycho can be set alight, so incendiary damage weapons can also be effective to keep him burning during run-and-gun fighting while avoiding contact. Corrosive weapons can be employed to similar effect.
Another way to beat the boss is to kill all of the midgets and then jump back into the small pit at the entrance. This can sometimes lure the boss into the pit where he will have trouble getting out, although attracts an element of risk with his grenades likely to land in close proximity of any characters in the pit at the time.
Another strategy is to shoot through the fences right behind the pit with a sniper rifle. They don't stop bullets like the one right in front of the pit.
After the Roid Rage Psycho is dead, a button becomes available near the center of the room. Pressing it causes a key to rise from an aperture in the floor.
A platform then extends across the pit. The fight back through the safe house, will not be any easier than the fight coming in, but some new doors will be open allowing players to choose a different path. It's shorter, but just as dangerous per room. The advantage of the new route is that it will have additional loot to pick up.

Sledge killed
Eridian Artifact
Strategy[]
Once inside the entrance to Headstone Mine there is a lengthy path looping a long way around to the south, and almost the entire area is inhabited by hostile bandits. From the entrance, the front area is well guarded and leads to a ramp to the right of a closed gate. A switch at the top will open the gate to proceed directly into the open area beyond, or alternatively a more circuitous route with plentiful cover can be taken by moving through the buildings at the top of the ramp. Overlooking the open ground is a Mulciber Mk 2 covering the path deeper in. Beyond the area and past the Mulciber is a mine tunnel leading to a lengthy area with limited cover and long range combat opportunities on open ground.
Once at Sledge's lair, an elevator leads up to an upper level with a Med Vendor and Ammo Vendor at the save point. Sledge can be found in a chamber at the end of a long corridor.
Sledge's shield is twice as strong as average, and he has very high health (about 2.5x as much as a Bruiser). Additionally, he is well armored, only taking 75% damage from shots to the torso. He also has armor plates on his arms and thighs which significantly reduce the damage taken to those locations down to only 20%, and wears a thick metal helmet which protects him from headshots unless shot in the glass slit or the exposed back of the head.
Sledge has two main attacks; Sledge's Shotgun and Sledge's Hammer. His shotgun has a very poor accuracy but a high damage and wide spread. The hammer has high direct damage and sends out a shock wave when hitting the ground. The shock wave is an area of effect attack that will damage and knock enemies back. Sledge will try to move into melee range throughout the entire fight. Avoiding close contact is recommended, instead moving and placing obstacles between the character and Sledge. In some cases it may be preferable to risk close contact briefly in order to escape, than allow a character to be backed into a corner.
Shock damage is especially useful in depleting Sledge's powerful shield. Rapid-fire attacks from combat rifles or SMGs are useful in chipping away at Sledge's health, wearing down his life while preventing his shield from regenerating. Elemental damage over time will also help with this. critical hits can aid the speed at which Sledge can be taken down, however Sledge's only critical hit location is the red glass on his welder's helmet or the back of his head, making this a more difficult proposition for this boss. Additionally, missing the critical hit spot and hitting Sledge in his helmet will cause him to greatly increase in speed for several seconds, making it much easier for him to catch up to the player with his close range attacks.
After the fight begins, bandits will spawn from both sides of the room. Some may be useful to leave alive as a means to gain a Second Wind. The design of the room is such that characters can loop around a large physical barrier on the right hand side after entering. This obstruction will allow some opportunity to recharge depleted shields before the attack is resumed. The room contains a few potentially fatal dead ends as well.
When Sledge is defeated, loot his chest and collect the artifact. A door will then open in the east wall of Sledge's lair allowing a quick shortcut back to the entrance area, thus bypassing most of the respawned bandits.
Isolated Tactics[]
Berserkers with Bash can finish Sledge quickly with repeated rapid punches. This works best by first dropping Sledge's shield with a shock attack or grenade, then using the fire artifact with Berserk. Two berserkers working together can also pummel him down in short order, without having to worry about much retaliation as he is constantly knocked around.
As with any tough enemy, being able to use skills that maintain the Daze effect on him (such as Brick's Bash or Lilith's Mind Games) significantly reduce the difficulty of the encounter.
Roland's Scorpio Turret can present a useful diversion, especially when empowered by a Shock Artifact. As the turret shoots Sledge, he will often pay more attention to the turret than the soldier.
It's possible to lure Sledge out of his arena through the doors, but it is tricky. This can be done by luring Sledge right onto the door, while remaining close to draw his hammer attack. From there the tanking character can be allowed to die, and upon respawning Sledge will have exited the arena. Alternately backing slowly while still in Sledge's hammer's range causes Sledge to come through the door. Once he is out, attackers can sit safely at the other end of the hall (near the vending machines) and kill him from there.
It is possible to get Sledge's left arm to stick out the right hand door by opening the door and luring him towards it so he hammer-strikes as it closes. Once this is achieved, a high powered incendiary weapon can be used to attack his forearm, setting him on fire.
It is also possible to maintain the appropriate distance from Sledge that causes him to repeatedly pound the ground with his hammer (causing a damaging shockwave), but while standing behind a waist-high obstacle that completely blocks the shockwave. This allows players the chance to score many free hits as he performs an ineffectual move over and over.
Transfusion grenades can be continuously thrown through the right door. The ammunition vendor is close enough to resupply the grenades frequently when they run out.
The entrance doors can be used to keep characters relatively safe by using them in a hit and run strategy on Sledge. This is done by opening the door, firing on Sledge and ducking away while the closed door blocks his ability to return fire.

Objectives[]
Eliminate Bandit Runner Patrols.
Runner Patrols destroyed: 0/8
Strategy[]
The final step to reaching Mad Mel involves eliminating various bandit patrols in the Dahl Headlands. The bandits can be found meandering all around the mountain in the middle of the headland in Out Riders. The Mad Mel Patrol is noticeably different from the regular Out Rider patrols normally found in this area however. They field the regular blue vehicle armed with a machine gun turret as well as an unusual red variant armed with a rocket turret, and in Playthrough 1 they are also marginally higher level than the usual Level 17 Out Riders in this area.
To eliminate the patrols, either drive around and engage them in vehicle-to-vehicle battles, or use a Runner to lure them to defensive positions where pedestrians have a chance of gunning them apart without being run over. In a vehicle it is recommended to keep moving at high speed to avoid fire, while maintaining a target lock with an Outrunner's turret gun. The machine gun turret is effective out in the open and at long ranges, while the rocket turret excels at closer ranges and if the patrols can be drawn into rocks where their movements are impeded, or stopped altogether.
One safe zone is the gate up to the home of Ernest Whitting. This can be used to flee the patrols if need be and the ramp at the top of this location can provide useful cover for snipers. The patrols often get caught up on the rocks below if they are lured into this area, making easy targets for pedestrians or vehicles alike.
Another place to make easy work of killing bandit patrols is from the hill where the Scavenger: Revolver mission takes place. If the vehicle is parked and facing north, the bandit patrols will come up one or two at a time and circle around below, making easy targets of themselves.
Return to Lucky to get the next part of the main storyline.

Talk to the Claptrap at the gate.""","Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Kill Mad Mel, then talk to Claptrap to be allowed into New Haven.
Mad Mel killed
Claptrap talked to
Strategy[]
Mad Mel will be encountered driving a truck in an arena to the south-east of Lucky's Last Chance Watering Hole. A New-U station and a Catch-A-Ride terminal are located just outside of the arena, providing a quick re-entry to the fight if a character dies or a vehicle is destroyed. The New-U station may need to be approached in order to ensure that it turns green indicating that it is ready to spawn a ""new you"" should the need arise.
Mel's arena needs to be entered to get Mel and his minions to come out, so a character cannot just stand outside the arena and snipe at them from the outset. The first wave of enemies, including Out Riders and Psychos, will only spawn once a character has passed very close to the structure in the centre of the circular arena.
Entrance to the arena is via driving or walking over a ramp which is high enough off the ground at the top end that there is no immediate way back, however several methods of returning over the ramp are available.
Mad Mel does not enter the fight until after at least one Out Rider has been destroyed. His truck is larger than the other vehicles in the arena and carries the rocket variant of a vehicular turret. As with the Out Riders, the truck will also achieve a near-instantaneous kill if it collides with a character, so fighting it as a pedestrian inside the arena is not recommended.
The primary strategy is to spawn a vehicle and whittle down the enemies until Mel appears. Outrunner with a machine gun turret is preferred over the one with a launcher turret, as this can track the fast moving targets more readily than rockets can. This is then locked onto a vehicle and fired constantly while other enemy vehicles in the arena provide an additional hazard.
Ramming into other vehicles can flip them upside-down. Although an Outrunner can be quickly flipped back onto its wheels, even that length of exposure can be fatal. Mad Mel will eventually enter the fight after a vehicle has been destroyed, at which point the strategy of locking on and gunning while driving around in circles can be repeated on his truck.
After Mad Mel appears, driving along the periphery of the arena reduces the chance of being hit by enemy fire and it will also cause the AI to stay around the center of the arena, which will make them easier targets.
The Out Riders and Mad Mel's vehicle are susceptible to corrosive weapons. Eridian guns fired directly at Mad Mel's truck while not in a vehicle are also effective, especially at close range.
If a character should die there is no requirement to re-enter the arena to complete the mission. Mel and his bandits can be killed from the relative safety of the ramp instead. He will continue firing at his attackers, but there is also room to retreat and regenerate a shield when it gets depleted. Soldier and Hunter characters will also find their action skills to be useful additions to toss in from the ramp.
Characters are easy targets on the ramp. If the difficulty of fighting on the ramp itself proves to be too great, then it is also possible to fire into the arena from on top of some pipes beyond the Catch-a-Ride terminal without sustaining heavy damage in the process.
Pedestrian Strategies[]
This battle is extremely difficult when in the arena on foot. There are numerous enemies in the arena and being struck by an outrider results in immediate death. There are also launcher rounds being fired from the holes in the wall and they cannot be eliminated, so be careful of those as they will continue to fire, even on dismounted characters.
Should a character wind up on foot in the arena, survival might be achieved by staying on the run and avoiding enemy vehicles. The spawns will stop after Mel is killed, so his truck will be a high priority.
A safer strategy is to trigger the encounter with Mad Mel and hop back over the ramp. It is possible to leave an Outrunner's back wheels on the edge of the ramp and use the vehicle as a return ramp to jump on and back over, although this can be a difficult stunt to achieve at times. Another return method is to ease the front wheels over the top of the ramp and then the front of the vehicle will drop to a position just low enough to use the ""Enter Vehicle"" function from the floor of the arena. The vehicle can then usually be exited safely at the top of the ramp, although sometimes a switch to the gunnery seat might be needed first to avoid dropping back into the arena. Alternatively, the vehicle can be parked below the ramp parallel to it, and then used as a stepping stone to jump over the ramp.
After killing[]
After Mel is killed, a new ramp will be added, which allows for a return path back through the entry gate, and the gate on the opposite side will also open. Take that exit and take the right fork, then talk to the Claptrap there to get into New Haven.
Once in New Haven, Helena Pierce can be found in a building in the south-east corner of the settlement and will be waiting to offer the mission reward.

The Claptrap that needs to be communicated with is at the south-east gate in New Haven and unlocks the gate to Rust Commons West.

Beyond the gate travel to Patricia Tannis involves travelling to the north-east corner of Rust Commons West. There is a New-U station near her camp on the western side of the Underpass that will offer a much more convenient transit point in later visits to Tannis.

Objectives[]
Kill bandits and spiderants.
Bandits killed: 0/25
Spiderants killed: 0/3
Strategy[]
Crazy Earl wants a Vault Hunter to do him a favor, which is to kill a numbers of bandits and spiderants crawling around in his scrapyard. Just beyond his home, three spiderants will emerge and attack, which clears that requirement almost immediately. A few bandits emerge from huts deeper in, presenting the forefront of the bandit forces dominating the area. They can be found throughout most of the scrapyard, and will attack on sight.

Bottle Of Booze: 0/24
Strategy[]
Treacher's Landing is located at the southern end of Rust Commons West. The closest Fast Travel station is at the Outeryard. The bottles drop off every bandit killed so make sure to loot everything. The way point doesn't really lead anywhere, but gives a general location. Just kill a lot of enemies and loot, loot, loot. Fast Travel back to Crazy Earl's Scrapyard for a reward.

""Thanks for the booze! Now, about that alien whatever-the-hell. Funny story. Krom heard about it and stopped by about a year ago. Gave me an offer I couldn't refuse.

Objectives[]
Get Krom's piece of the Vault Key and return to Tannis.
Krom killed
Vault Key Piece
Strategy[]
Krom's Canyon is located at the northern end of Rust Commons East just past the flood lock (point number one on map above). There is a switch at the flood lock that opens the gate allowing a vehicle to pass. This also awakens some spiderants in the riverbed.
The connection to Krom's Canyon is heavily guarded by bandits, including two automated turrets and another manned one. The two automated turrets can be eliminated from the flood lock with long range attacks and the distance is too far for them to retaliate.
Inside the canyon, the left fork at the beginning leads to Krom along the bottom ground level. Alternatively, upon entering, the stairs and catwalk to the right of the vending machines lead to a higher path to Krom's area of the canyon through a series of elevated encampments.
Krom's presence in the final area of the canyon is announced by an introductory cutscene, and Krom's cannonfire can reach most of the area beyond this point (number two on map above) other than obvious points behind cover.
One can stay back at the entrance to Krom's area and shoot at him from a great distance without taking much damage from his machine gun. The problem is that he also fires rockets which can drain a character's shields, and pressure a retreat for cover, during which time his health replenishes.
Long-range attacks from the entrance to the area can eliminate Krom quickly, although players must still reach Krom's position to collect the Vault key piece. If killing Krom is not a viable option (in cases where the players or characters are better suited to short-range fighting), then they must fight their way up the narrow bridges while coming under fire from the turret. In this case it is highly recommended to stay close to cover and stay away from unexploded barrels. Bandits will harass from various angles during the ascent.
The Soldier class can deploy their Scorpio turret as a distraction. Krom will focus his fire on the turret while attackers run up to his back and acquire the Vault key fragment freely.
After the Vault key fragment is acquired, escape the canyon and Fast Travel to the Underpass to hand the key fragment over to Tannis.

Strategy[]
The objective of this mission is to kill Jaynis Cobb and this involves fighting through a number of his bandits to reach him. Entry via the front gate will attract fire from various angles as the bandits appear from the buildings and shoot out into the open area inside the front gate. And alternative approach can be made from the lookout tower not far from the gate where characters can be made to jump from from the access ramp to the rock wall overlooking Jaynistown. This vantage point can be used to rain fire down on the bandits from relative safety before proceeding inside.

Strategy[]
It is immediately apparent that a series of Gatling Turrets have sprung up in ""Taylortown"". They can be destroyed from various covered positions with a sniper rifle or corrosive/explosive weapon and destroying them promptly before entering the town is always a beneficial way to proceed. Bandits can, and will, crawl out of doorways, potentially catching intruders by surprise, so be on the lookout for new arrivals to the conflict at all times.
Once the town has been sufficiently cleared of bandits, the next stage is an open gate leading into an area with a large rock and a clifftop building. Two Rocket Turrets will emerge from the roof of the building as intruders approach, and two Bruisers will spawn along with Taylor Kobb. Another bandit or two may also spawn nearby when the bruisers appear.
It is suicidal to enter the area with the five enemies present, as the rockets launched from the turrets have rough homing capabilities, along with the weapons the Brusiers use, which can deal considerably high damage. The Brusiers may attempt to chase the Vault Hunters outside the area, though they may also get stuck behind the fences.
Deal with the Rocket Turrets first, before killing the Bruisers if they haven't been killed already. The only remaining enemy should be Taylor Kobb, who is armed with The Roaster - a Maliwan rocket launcher imbued with heavy incendiary elements and burst fires three rockets in rapid succession. It's considerably less accurate than the rockets fired from Bruisers, but can still pack a heavy punch if a direct hit lands. Taylor Kobb will not attempt to melee players, but it should be quite easy to take him down once he is alone.
Once Taylor is killed, head back to where he was first met and turn the mission in to his Claptrap.

Another boss battle awaits. A Rakk Hive has awoken from hibernation and must be fought in order to clear the way to the next fragment of the Vault key. It has a range of attacks, from a shock wave inducing stomp to various corrosive excretions, but the most curious of all its arsenal are the flights of rakk that periodically spring from its back. The Rakk Hive also has a unique attack when attacked from the rear, spewing liquid feces on nearby targets.[1]
The path to the Rakk Hive is the northern of the two possible branches in the Trash Coast and is moderately populated by various spiderants, most of whom may be run past without engaging in combat. Along the way are several ammo crates and a minor detour further east is an option to encounter more spiderants and one red chest.
Entering the combat area for this fight triggers a brief cutscene featuring the Rakk Hive as it stirs and arises from the earth. From then on the battle alternates between fighting off flights of rakk and discharging weapons at the colossal form of the Rakk Hive. Cover is plentiful on the ledge overlooking the field, so staying clear of the beast is largely effortless, leaving only the rakk to contend with while shields recharge and ammunition is retrieved. Its weakest points are the four eye sockets, which offer critical hit locations before and after sustained damage causes the eyes to burst.
Automatic weapons are useful for inflicting damage on the head of the Rakk Hive and will yield frequent critical hits on the eyes. More precise targeting with single shot scoped weapons is well suited to scoring critical hits, although this tactic also comes recommended with a weapon switch to something better suited for killing the sporadic flights of rakk. Shotguns are very effective against the rakk, and will also provide a useful means of dealing with the Rakk Hive itself, due to the hive's enormous size and the frequency of critical hits scored when its head is shot. Masher revolvers are also very useful in that the spread is a good way of disposing of the rakk and, coupled with the hidden +100% critical hit damage, an effective weapon against the Rakk Hive's eyes.
Once the Rakk Hive is dead, the area can be looted. The only thing left to do is to retrieve the next Vault key fragment and this objective is located by following the compass waypoint to a covered cave entrance. As the cave is approached, a jet of flame will rip through the seal and a large rakk will burst out and take flight. Neither the flame nor the rakk will cause any harm to a character, so the encounter is simply waited out before any vault hunters can enter. Inside, a number of regular sized rakk will similarly take to the air, although some of these may attack when fired upon. The Vault key fragment is in a chest at the heart of this rookery, nestled in a collection of old bone and bloodied remains.

Take back the final piece of the Vault Key from Baron Flynt.
Bandit patrols destroyed: 0/4
Thor infiltrated
Baron Flynt killed
Strategy[]
Before proceeding to the final fight on top of Baron Flynt's stronghold, it might pay to check on ammunition stocks and replenish as needed. There is a Med Vendor and an Ammo Vendor on the eastern side of Thor for this purpose. When the preparations are complete the upper decks can then be accessed by riding an elevator up from directly beneath the excavator. The entrance to the elevator is on the western side.
The Baron sits on his throne on an elevated platform, and shouldn't be engaged immediately. When a character steps away from the elevator, several building doors open, and Mutant Midget Psychos and psychos come pouring out. After the first wave is dispatched, a second wave, which includes a Badass psycho, will attack. A third wave consisting of the two bodyguards of the Baron, Hanz and Franz, will then rise out of the deck on a wide platform. Franz is a tougher-than-usual badass bruiser who moves slowly while firing a machine gun, while Hanz will rush forward to melee with his giant sword as well as lob Proximity Mine Grenades. Hanz is relatively quick, and will rapidly close range with his targets. An effective approach is to lure Hanz away from Franz, and attack while using spaces around the rear of the elevator for cover. Hanz will fall quickly to critical damage and then the gunner can be attacked more easily. It is also possible to back into several places that Hanz does not follow. Franz does not move much, so it is possible to stand next to him and critical hit him to prevent him from returning fire. Both are very durable, but can be whittled down quickly with headshots; Franz has an average shield as well as about 4 times the health of a regular bruiser, while Hanz is unshielded and has about 2/3rds as much health as Franz. Special care should be taken after defeating Hanz, as any Proximity Mines he lobbed while still alive will remain active on the field and are hard to see. Stepping on one of these mines will likely instantly incapacitate the player, regardless if they have a fully charged shield. A Lilith could cast Phasewalk and run over the paths Hanz walked on while alive to safely detonate any remaining mines.
If the two bodyguards prove to be difficult there is a shed around to the right of the elevator with communications dishes on top that can be exploited. Access is gained by jumping on a fuel tank and then the dishes can be used for cover. This location will provide various useful firing angles while simultaneously offering good cover from attacks.
Baron Flynt himself, along with a handful of regular bandits, present the last fight on top of Thor. They will filter down to the deck from the raised rear of the structure, some making the descent and others firing from above. The Baron uses a Shotgun that fires a sustained burst of six rockets at a medium speed but with low accuracy. After he fires, there will be a five to six second break where he reloads or just idles, allowing attackers a short window of opportunity to open fire on him. Each rocket is damaging enough that being exposed to an entire salvo is something to be avoided, so keeping to cover and making use of the reloading pauses can be a valuable tactic in bringing down Flynt. Flynt has a decent shield and has a similarly high amount of health as Franz, so scoring critical hits is very helpful.
The mission is turned in at the large chest behind Flynt's throne.

Objectives
Find Tannis, wherever she may be.
Tannis found
Strategy
Get Some Answers is obtained by accessing a white chest that rises up through the deck of Thor after Baron Flynt is killed. From the Salt Flats follow the compass waypoint to The Backdoor at Thor Cave.
The Backdoor is a winding tunnel network inhabited by numerous spiderants. These will ambush at various stages along the length of the cave system. A save point and weapons cache is located towards the end of the tunnel and two more red chests and an ammo vendor mark the last sales and resupply point before a final boss fight. (Although, it is actually possible to grenade jump back up.)
The final encounter in the Backdoor is accessed by dropping down into a cramped cage enclosure and accessing a data recorder found there. This will cause the cage to lift away revealing a storage warehouse littered with a number of wooden crates. Shortly after entering this chamber Master McCloud and two of the Lance Royal Guard will attack.
Master McCloud uses an Eridian Cannon, and the powerful, but slow, blasts from the weapon can make short work of characters caught in them. He is accompanied by two heavily-armored Lance Royal Guards. Together, the three of them can present a formidable encounter, although the various crates in the room provide ample cover to avoid most of their attacks. Alternatively, moving quickly around the perimeter of the room can help with avoiding enemy fire. Corrosive weapons are a very effective damage source in taking the trio down. A fair example would be placing some corrosive rain grenades as soon as they spawn.
It is sometimes possible to completely avoid combat with McCloud by keeping to the extreme back of the room just after entering. The two guards will react when fired upon, however McCloud himself may remain in position, oblivious to the incoming fire. Using this tactic, it is best to kill McCloud quickly before the other pair close to a more effective firing range. Otherwise, it is advisable to kill the guards as McCloud will pose less of a threat with his slow-firing cannon.
The Crimson Fastness is populated by a high concentration of Crimson Lance units of various types and also occasional Gatling Turrets. Battle through these to reach Patricia Tannis, who will be found incarcerated in a prison cell in the south-west corner of the stronghold.

Objectives[]
Find the ECHO command console.
ECHO console found
Strategy[]
A quick mission after finding Patricia Tannis which leads to the ECHO command console. There is a weapons cache near by, be sure to check it before leaving.
The Gatling Turret guarding the stairs can be overtaken by crouch-walking through a ventilation section. The entrance to it is in the wall on the right side just after the big red dumpster. It is not marked on the map. The character will be fired upon by the turret when entering the vents and when exiting at the top. This strategy only works with the Siren, Soldier and hunter. Apparently, Brick does not fit in the vent.
Another easy way to deal with this turret is to crouch behind the boxes just after rounding the corner to this area. Slowly creep out until just a small section of the base of the turret is exposed. Aim for this small section to inflict damage and destroy the turret. If done correctly the turret cannot fire on the characters position and only the Lance soldiers will be of any danger to the character.

I don't have to tell you what to do, do I?""","Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Find Steele and take back the Vault Key.
Steele found
Strategy[]
Find Steele involves a lengthy road trip through various areas where characters are pitted against the Crimson Lance and the Guardians. Recommended weapons against the Crimson Lance are generally long ranged, accurate, and do corrosive damage. The Guardians are best approached with shock damage attacks, and the optimal weapon types extend to all types depending on the terrain and types of Guardians encountered.
Mordecai's Trespass skill is highly effective against the Guardians in this mission, as they have very strong shields but very low health. The other characters will do well with either shock or corrosive Artifacts equipped for their Action Skills to complement their weapon damage. Frequent switching of the equipped Artifact between Corrosive and Shock is a common tactic when encountering both Crimson Lance and Guardian enemies together.
Begin the Chase[]
After the ECHOnet is restored, head out to the Crimson Enclave and use the Fast Travel to return to the Salt Flats and grab a Runner to reach the next waypoint. The final approach to the waypoint must be completed on foot and is guarded by the Crimson Lance who have established a base camp for others of their brigade already on the march to the Vault. Much of their encampment can be avoided by heading directly to the transition marked by the waypoint. A narrow path runs down to the transition below the cliff edge and if the waypoint is approached directly characters can simply drop off the edge and onto it before ducking through to The Descent.

The Descent[]
The Descent is a linear area filled with many Crimson Lance and Guardians. The first encounter is against several Guardians and the initial staging area is a good place to get characters set up for Shock damage attacks. Sera Guardians present fast moving targets that can be difficult to track. Depending on where they fly some can even be ignored as players progress deeper into the Descent.
The second stage has players exiting a tunnel overlooking a huge chamber that has turned into a battleground between the Crimson Lance and the Guardians. Highly accurate, long ranged weapons can be used to great effect to dispatch Sera Guardians drifting above the battle. The combatants below can be pummeled with whatever weapons the Vault hunters have equipped. Raining area effect blasts down on the heads of the combatant below can offer a method of participating in the fight while keeping characters fairly safe from return fire.

Eridian Promontory[]
The Eridian Promontory begins with some conveniently positioned vending machines right at the start of the area. The vendors are the last of such machines encountered in the game. The Guardians in this area are often encountered in surprise ambush positions where they suddenly materialise and attack. For this reason it is often best to have Shock damage attacks ready for use if there are no Crimson Lance around, because a fight against the Guardians could erupt at any moment. The Crimson Lance, on the other hand, will be encountered in concealed positions and already in combat against the Guardians. Approaching them may spark surprise Guardian attacks.
There are many sheer drops off the sides of the Eridian Promontory. Under normal conditions, backing away from opponents that are charging into melee range is a common tactic, however in this area a misstep can spell the instant demise of a character. In many cases it is often better to turn and run, rather than continue a retreating fight. Some ledges just below the level of the paths here are deceptive in that they look easy to step on to retrieve drops, however stepping out onto them can spell the instant demise of a character. Guardians can fall off themselves, and survive, so it is not unusual to see a red blip on the radar belonging to an unreachable enemy.
At the end of the Eridian Promontory lies an open area, with the transition to the Vault at the back. It is highly recommended that all characters present are healed up and have full ammunition stocks before passing through the final door.

Objectives
Defeat the Destroyer.
Destroyer defeated
Strategy
Preparation
This fight can be one of the hardest in the game if the appropriate preparations are not made. It is advisable to have at least one powerful, reasonably-accurate weapon for each weapon class.
The next issue is ammunition. The Destroyer can take hundreds of hits before dying, which places some importance on ensuring that all ammunition is well stocked before the fight. Ammo regeneration weapons or class mods work well when combined with lower-level SDUs.
Eridian weapons can also be used to help alleviate the ammunition depletion, but due to their slow recharge times they should be considered to be an occasional sidearm at best.
The levels of the attacking characters can also be taken into consideration. By levelling characters several levels above the level of the Destroyer, any attackers will inflict more damage and sustain less throughout the course of the fight. In Playthrough 2, the upgraded next playthrough-like setting becomes accessible as soon as the mission Find Steele is completed, so characters can exit the Vault and proceed to farm even higher level creatures for experience and maximum damage weapons before returning to finish off the Destroyer.
Killing The Destroyer
The Destroyer shouldn't be approached up close, as it will periodically slam its front tentacles down onto the ground, creating a powerful shockwave in the area directly in front of it. The first priority is to take cover and destroy the purple tentacles that sprout from the Destroyer's back. These launch large purple needles that explode upon hitting the ground, dealing extreme damage (often being enough to instantly down a Vault Hunter with a direct hit). The needles often arc over the available cover, so they cannot simply be ignored. Accurate weapons of any type work well here. The glowing purple orbs near the middle of the tentacles can be destroyed to score critical hits. The tentacles can be destroyed to obtain a Second Wind if downed, although it may not be possible to get line-of-sight on them if one is downed while behind cover due to a spike arcing over cover.
It is generally a poor idea to take cover at the rear of the arena, near the cliff edge, as the Destroyer will periodically lash out with a tongue attack from its mouth which has significant range and will knock Vault Hunters backward a few dozen feet, potentially sending them over the cliff edge. The two large pillars on either side of the Destroyer make for much better cover, as they are far enough away to be out of the range of the Destroyer's shockwave attack, and also large enough to provide cover from its eyebeam attack.
When the tentacles have been dealt with, it is largely safe to fire on the eye to yield a string of critical hits that quickly whittle down the Destroyer's life. Rapid-fire weapons with large magazine sizes, such as combat rifles or SMGs, will generally deal more damage-per-second than slower firing, low magazine, higher damage-per-bullet weapons such as sniper rifles or revolvers. Shooting the tongue when it attacks also yields a critical hit, which can be useful for shotgun users.
Another tactic which can make this fight trivial is to run behind the top right pillar. Provided that the character's shield is strong enough, or the character has transfusion grenades etc. the visible tentacle can be shot at without the character getting hit by the eye beam or the shock wave. The flying spikes will still hit, but shields can effectively absorb their damage.
Also a good strategy is to hide behind the rocks to the right and shoot the large purple tentacles which come out after The Destroyer's health is low . This method takes a while, but is safe.
Using a Bouncing Bettie grenade mod and throwing all your grenades in its mouth at the start of the battle is also a fast and easy way to deal great amounts of damage.
The Fight Continues
Once roughly one third of The Destroyer's health is gone, it will edge out of the Vault a bit more and latch on to two pillars on the side of the arena. These anchoring tentacles are vulnerable to melee attacks, with the pillar shielding the melee attacker from many of The Destroyer's own attacks. The Destroyer will also sprout four more purple tentacles and start periodically firing a dangerous eye beam.
When the Destroyer’s eye changes, attackers may take cover behind the pillar to avoid the thin blue beam that will be sustained for several seconds. Though it may appear as though the beam is passing directly through the pillar, it will not damage any concealed character. To be safe, one can pop out for a second, look directly at the eye, and open fire when the beam abates.
Once the Destroyer's health is reduced enough for it to grab the outermost pillars, characters can be positioned behind the pillars where the spikes and the eye beam can't reach.

Find two more data recorders in Skag Gully.

The first Data Recorder is located on the high ground across the stone bridge to the south east. The initial path to it is under the stone bridge and a loop around to the right to actually cross the bridge. The Data Recorder is found near two dead bodies and a red chest.
The second Data Recorder can be found on the path to the outcropping to the North, where the Rakk spawn. It can be found lying under a small shelter with two more dead bodies. Once complete, he mission is turned in at the Fyrestone Bounty Board.

Kill Scar in Skag Gully and return T.K. Baha's Prosthetic Leg.
Scar killed
T.K. Baha's Leg
Strategy[]
T.K. announces that a Skag named Scar made off with his leg and now he wants it back. You are supposed to be level 7, but level 8 or 9 would be ideal. Bring some powerful guns (incendiaries work well). Travel to Skag Gully and follow the path down and to the east, circling around to the top. There are Rakk to be fought for the first time on this path near an abandoned tarpaulin. Try to eliminate all skags in Scar's vicinity before fighting Scar as they can distract you and help Scar kill you.
Once Scar is attacked, he will charge and jump immense distances to reach melee range of his targets. His special attacks are very damaging to a lower level character, so be careful. One of his special attacks involves spitting out brown bile. Evading this attack and returning fire may yield critical hits on his open mouth, hastening his demise. Incendiary damage will also be useful in bringing him down quickly.
After Scar is killed, collect T.K.'s prosthetic leg and gather up the loot. The ramp behind the weapons chest has now been lowered and can be used as a shortcut to head back to T.K.'s house in the Arid Badlands.

T.K. states that he needs the Bladeflower Seeds to plant so he can get though the winter, and needs more from Skag Gully. The Bladeflowers are scattered along the curving path on the north part of the map. Follow the trail, killing Skags along the way. The skags on this path are tougher than those previously encountered, and include Adult Skags and Badass Skags. There is also a hidden chest behind some brambles up a side path at the topmost bend.

The required Repair Kit can be found a little further into the Lost Cave. Just before crossing the bridge, the Repair Kit can be found in the end of a pipe. The third image shows the map location, while the fourth image shows the repair kit.
This Claptrap, upon being repaired, wheels around the area it is found in. It will offer a reward of a Backpack SDU on the first playthrough.

Go to the Lost Cave and shoot the Crystal Clusters to break them apart. Watch out for the bandits that have taken over the cave.""","Shock Crystal Harvest Video walkthrough
Objectives
Harvest Shock Crystals in the Lost Cave.
Shock Crystals: 0/50
Strategy
Shock crystals are positioned sporadically throughout the cave, and although there are other crystals the shock crystals can be distinguished by their crackling noises and blue pulsing glow. When shot, these will break apart and the broken shards can be collected off the ground. There are five crystals per stash. Using a powerful shotgun at close range can instantly break the stash, earning all five crystals straight away.
This mission can be very difficult if attempted the moment the mission appears on the bounty board. Characters below level 13 may be at a disadvantage against the skags, worms, and a large camp of bandits. It is possible to enter the cave, sprint to the first crystal stash, shoot it, collect it, then run for the cave exit. The next time the cave is entered, the crystal stash will have respawned and the exploit can be repeated.
For the first bandit encampment, a long-distance weapon (sniper or revolver with a powerful scope) is recommended. Accurate or Hyperion combat rifles - particularly those with shock - can also be a great help to pick off the majority of the bandits from a manageable distance. This is as the encampment is actually the size of two ""normal"" bandit camps. Characters without long-range capabilities can make do, but must make good use of cover as enemies will be firing down at a slight incline.

Rifle body: Is located on the wood and sheet metal walk-way connecting the upper portion of the shack to the ridge line. It sits on a large box. (It's not on the round hut, it's on the high ridge line to the upper right, indicator is very general.)
Rifle barrel: From the compound entrance, take the dirt ramp to the right and continue along its path. After crossing corrugated steel bridge, there is an observation deck to the right; the barrel is on the table. This piece appears to be the farthest from the others and the waypoint is incorrectly marked for this item marking it someplace near the base of the round hut.
Rifle sight: Under a pile of trash and rubble before the left ramp going up.
Rifle stock: On the top level of the central shack there is a large rusty tank with an arrow pointing up. Sniper rifle stock is on a shelf near the toilet.

Instead, I'm offering to pay anyone to find them and take them down.""","The Legend Of Moe and Marley Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Kill Moe and Marley.
Moe killed
Marley killed
Strategy[]
Moe and Marley are located in the Arid Hills. They can be found in the north-western section of the area.
Moe and Marley can present a formidable encounter for players of their level. They are both Badass Alpha Skags, with Moe being a Badass Fire Skag and Marley being a Badass Shock Skag. The duo also wander around a massive Skag den, which may contain potentially dangerous Skags to appear while fighting them.
As both are Alpha Skags, Corrosive weapons are highly effective against them, being able to whittle a massive amount of their health from the bleed damage applied. It's also recommended to attack their rear when possible, as they take reduced damage if shot at from the front. Skags are naturally aggressive towards bandits, and there is a bandit camp near their position in which Moe may be lured into. However, the bandits will usually end up dying to Moe unless a Burning Psycho is one of the four spawns, as Moe will be unable to kill him due to his natural fire immunity.
Moe prefers to attack the Vault Hunters up close, while Marley prefers hanging in the back. Moe will attempt to claw the player, and can also perform a charge attack if the target is too far from it. Marley will continually track players and launch electrical blasts around its target, though they may be shot out of the air. If any Vault Hunter gets too close to Marley, then it will roar and slam the ground, causing massive knock-back.
It's possible to lure one of the duo away, though this shouldn't be relied on as they generally wander around together.
Killing Marley before Moe can be beneficial, because Marley's shock damage is tuned to depleting shields, while Moe's incendiary attacks are a more effective damage dealer to flesh.

Objectives[]
It's kill or be killed!
Round survived
Strategy[]
Before the fight make sure that participating characters are stocked up on healing and ammunition supplies. Depending on the character's level this could be a difficult fight. The enemies here will be multiple: Skag Whelps, Spitter skags, and an Alpha Skag.
Upon entering the nearby arena, the door will close shut until all participating characters either kill the skags or are killed themselves. There are several ""dens"" that will open on the perimeter of the arena randomly spawning Skags. Round 2 is similar to round 1, except the skags are slightly tougher. There will be 6-10 monsters spawned randomly and not more than 3-4 at any given time. It is usually helpful to hold back class skills until the last skag of the fight, due to the increased difficulty of this final adversary.
One effective strategy is to use MIRV grenades and an elemental weapon that fires quickly. The elemental damage-over-time is very effective against the heavily armoured skags, especially Incendiary. If characters die, they can head back into the arena and resume the fight without having to repeat any portions of it, because the skags will not respawn. Once the round is survived the door opens and any gladiators are free to go.
It is also possible to plant Proximity Mines at each of the Skags' spawn points before the match starts. The entrance only closes after the quest has been accepted and center of the arena reached. It is possible to enter the arena beforehand, drop some Proximity Mines at the entrance to each Skag den, then run out to buy some more. Done quickly enough, it is possible to lay two or three traps per spawn point while having a complete supply of grenades before accepting the mission and actually fight the round.

Upon entering, the gate will close, locking the Vault Hunters in with their foes. It will remain shut until either all the skags are dead, or the vault hunters die themselves. There are several ""dens"" that will open on the perimeter of the arena randomly spawning Skags. Round 2 is similar to round 1 except the skags are slightly tougher. There will be 6-10 skags spawned randomly but no more than 3-4 at a single time. It is helpful to be mindful of the cooldowns on class skills until the last skag of the fight, due to the increased difficulty of this final adversary.

One box of cigars is found up on the ledge, and the ledge itself will provide a good vantage point to conduct most of the upcoming fight from.

Go to the opposite side of the big boulder next to the fence and hop from the little boulder up to the big one, then from there, run and jump to the ledge with the sight. The valve down inside the enclosure is one of the objectives of Well There's Your Problem Right There and is best completed when the gun sight is recovered.

Destroy the Bandit Fuel Tanks.
Fuel Tanks destroyed: 0/3
Strategy[]
This mission becomes available after the Fast Travel Network is powered up. There are three fuel tanks around Dahl Headlands to destroy.
One is north-west of the watering hole, right near the Catch-A-Ride at the base of the giant hill. Bandits will come out and defend the fuel tank, so kill them quickly.
One is at the Ludicrous Speedway, in a small enclosed yard adjoining the office building there. Unlike thse other two fuel tanks, the enemies here are scythids and not bandits. The building will contain mainly Crawlers and Desert Scythids, while the yard outside can spawn any scythid.
The last one is in the north-west corner of the map, right below the pool. This fuel tank is protected by bandits, and defeating them can be difficult for low-leveled characters due to a one-way entry point, which allows the enemies to focus fire more effectively.
Each tank takes damage based on the number of hits it takes, rather than the damage inflicted by any single hit. Hence a repeater is more effective here than a rocket launcher.

It was great in its day, but it's been abandoned since the corporations pulled out. I'm thinking of reopening the place, but there's a catch. It's been overrun with vermin. I need someone to go out there and kill all the bugs.""","Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Kill the Scythid Crawlers at the racetrack.
Scythid killed: 0/50
Strategy[]
The racetrack is west out of the watering hole in the north-west corner of the Dahl Headlands. The mission is simple: kill any scythid on the track by any means.
Splattering the scythid with a vehicle is the quickest method of killing them, with a chance of damaging a vehicle should it impact with Badass Elemental Scythid. There is a Catch-A-Ride halfway through the course in case any Outrunners get destroyed. Once fifty have been killed head back to Lucky to receive the reward.
However, should the adventurer(s) choose to earn as much XP and loot as possible while attempting the mission, the mission should then be attempted on foot. This will not only keep the adventurers from having to continuously enter and exit a vehicle to pick up loot, but allow access to their action skills as certain characters have skills to earn more items. In theory, the team could even pick and choose which Scythids to kill, like Badass variants for example, if only to make as much as possible out of this mission.
On Playthrough 2, the tougher scythids will cause the destruction of the vehicle in short order. It's best to go slow, clearing out an area by running over bugs (which is the fastest way to kill them) until the vehicle's condition is low, then back into the area just cleared and shoot at them from a distance until the vehicle is restored. When an area is completely cleared out, the area can be easily looted before proceeding on to the next section.

Elemental Artifact found
Strategy[]
This mission takes place inside the mountain in the middle of the Dahl Headlands. The subterranean chambers must be accessed by way of an elevator that is guarded by several bandits aboveground at the top, as well as several more near the bottom who are retreating from some ""ghosts"" when the elevator reaches the bottom. A weapons and health vendor is also here, allowing you to restore lost health if you need to.
Venturing into the passage takes one past some grisly bandit corpses to an expansive cavern with two large statues in the middle. When approached, the statues start to turn, at which point a Guardian Spectre and two Guardian Wraiths will spawn and attack. They have powerful shields but are not particularly high in health, so using shock elemental damage on them is very effective. Upon killing the Guardian Spectre, it will drop a weapon, grenade mod, shields or a random level 2 Eridian artifact.
The mission is turned in at the far end of the cavern and rewarded with a new level 2 explosive artifact.

Much of the mission takes place in the Tetanus Warren. The main path comes to a fork in the road with another path to the immediate left, and near this branch is a Claptrap for Claptrap Rescue: Tetanus Warren. This environment is a series of tunnels populated by groups of bandits. Beyond the various bandit groups lies an open doorway, and after any character passes through the door King Wee Wee will approach from a back chamber inside.
King Wee Wee has powerful melee attacks, but he is quite fragile for a boss and a few well placed shots from a revolver, shotgun or sniper rifle will kill him. Due to his smaller height, his melee attacks can be avoided by jumping. When King Wee Wee raises his hand, he will release energy bolts and shock waves. These have very limited range and can easily be avoided by keeping away from him.

The Claptrap can be found in the first main open area in Tetanus Warren. The first image shows the location on the Tetanus Warren map, the second image shows the in-game area. A group of Spiderants and a group of Bandits are in this area.
The required Repair Kit can be found further along in the tunnels of Tetanus Warren. From the Claptrap, follow the north west passage to the location indicated on the third image. Upon arriving at the platform on the right which has a table and chairs, a large metal structure can be seen curving up just beyond it. The repair kit is on a ledge there.
Once at this location, there is a bit of jumping to do in order to obtain the Repair Kit. As shown in the directions in the remaining four images, there are some metal scraps lead up to the roof of a shack. Walk out onto the canopy and jump to the roof of the adjacent dome-shaped hut. Walk out onto the canopy of this hut and jump to a platform made of a piece of metal scrap. From this platform, collect the Repair Kit.
An alternative that may be easier is to stand at the end of the platform just underneath and short of where the repair kit is. Look up towards the repair kit and jump. The icon for the repair kit should be visible. If the stats menu is not visible, move up a little and jump again until it is, then jump up and press the pick up key to fetch the kit. This method of getting items which are high out of reach can be used in several places in the game.

Mothrakk killed
Strategy[]
Fast Travel to Titan's End, or the Lost Cave from New Haven and start heading to the waypoint. The area is right outside the Lost Cave. Make sure to get the respawn point right near the Lost Cave lit green. Light the three torches and Mothrakk will spawn overhead.
Unlike other rakk, Mothrakk will not dive bomb her prey. Instead she remains high up and rains down a series of explosive fireball attacks. These can be blocked by hiding under cover in various roofed structures, or easily outpaced in a vehicle. The fireballs can also be outrun by sprinting, although this tactic has limited value outside of providing a decoy in a multiplayer game.
A common strategy is to get under cover on foot. Mothrakk shoots fireballs that explode when they hit the ground, but she only shoots after being shot at, so abandoning cover to fire a few shots, then returning to cover is a viable tactic. Sledge's Shotgun is recommended against Mothrakk, as despite the massive distance away, Mothrakk is extremely large that the poor accuracy of the shotgun shouldn't even be a problem.
A nearby Catch-A-Ride station can be used as cover. There is also a nearby hut down the hill from the torches that may be of some use, as it conceals a vending machine, as well as provides cover. There are two midgets inside, and three other bandits outside, who will need to be dealt with if the hut is to be used during the fight with Mothrakk. Other hiding places include the shed next to the Headstone Mine entrance for its spacious cover, the Groaning Hollow entrance for access to vending machines and The Piss Wash Hurdle ramp with its two ammo crates underneath.
If caught out in the open, avoid running in a straight line for an extended distance. Mothrakk's fireball shots will lead the character's current movement, and running in continuous straight lines will result in direct hits. Changing direction after each fireball is launched will minimize the chances of being hit, or at least minimize splash damage. It is possible for a skilled adventurer to defeat Mothrakk without the use of overhead cover, by regularly making evasive maneuvers in this manner. This tactic however, requires a great deal of skill.

Ammo Dumps destroyed: 0/6
Strategy[]
This area is located kind of in the middle of the map. The waypoint does pinpoint the location of all the ammo dumps. There are two located next to each other inside the warehouse. One is by the east entrance next to a weapon chest. One is on the rooftop of the building closest to the west entrance. The last two are next to the house on the north hill.
The objective is to shoot the ammo dumps to destroy them, and then return to Marcus Kincaid for the reward. Despite what the mission briefing says, elemental weapons are not required to ignite the ammo dumps.
Completion[]

Objectives[]
Destroy Weapon Caches and find evidence.
Caches destroyed: 0/6
Evidence found
Strategy[]
South of the Outeryard the first little complex reached is the destination. The waypoint will lead to each cache.
The first cache is next to the tent and another is against the building. Several more can be found deeper in the encampment, access via ramp and a walkway from inside the building. There is also a large green-flashing crate on the left, which holds the evidence.

Objectives[]
Kill One-Eyed Jack, and bring back his eye as proof.
Jack's Other Eye
Strategy[]
Pierce is offering an assassination mission to kill One-Eyed Jack. Jack is located back in the vicinity of the ammo dumps in the previous mission, and exits a small house at the base of the hill when the area is approached.
One-Eyed Jack moves through an area accessible to vehicles, rendering him a relatively easy target to eliminate seeing as he can simply be run over. Alternatively, he can be fought on foot, although he presents an unusual target enemy due to his unique revolver, Madjack. The Madjack's bullets have odd spiral trajectories, and are very damaging against both shield and flesh alike.
Nearby bandits may pose an additional problem, and between these and One-Eyed Jack himself, it is recommended to conduct the fight from behind cover and maintain room to retreat.

Strategy[]
The general location that the waypoint leads is at the south edge of The Rust Commons West. The quickest Fast Travel is the Outeryard. Near the waypoint marker are metal containers blocking vehicle traffic. From here the first piece can be seen.
Barrel: The barrel is on top of a metal container just inside the opening, and can be reached from atop the said container.Looking northwest another piece is visible at eye level on top of the curved overhang. Directly west is a fence with a closed gate. This will open after a few bandits near the gate are killed.
Magazine: is in the tire on the ground.
Body: The body is on a roof of the first floor of the building. This is accessed via the gate and heading right, up around the slope and up the ramp to get on top of the second floor of the building, then jumping down to the roof of the first floor.
Sight: The sight is sitting on a cot on the overhang. From the first floor roof of the building, jump to the top of the column east of the building, then jump across to a ledge protruding from the overhang, then quickly jump to the overhang.

Strategy[]
Time to go on another Journal hunt. Fast Travel to the Underpass, or go get the fast travel point at the start. Go through all 5 points on the map, collecting Journal Entries on the way.
Head northwest from the Underpass, past the windmill, to the bandit camp with 3 huts. Journal 224 is in a small open box under a mini tent, and get out fast. This is the home of Rakkinishu.
Head south down the sludge river a short ways to a building complex with some bandits. Journal 321 is on the left, sitting on a pair of covered boxes.
Continue following the river, under the plant, and to the next small patch of land in the river. Flock of rakks nest here. There is a small metal shack on the left with 3 flowers growing outside. Inside, hanging on the wall, is Journal 457.
Keep heading down the river, making a left at the fork where the arena is. Take the path to the right and up the hill and stay to the left at the fork with the arrow pointing right. Hug the wall on the right from here until a turret starts aiming with a laser; take out the turret and bandits. Climb up the open winding stairs all the way to the top and get Journal 481 from the wall of the closed little office at the top. Jump onto the pipe and walk along it to get to the other side where the turret was, loot the white chest here.
For the last Journal entry, go back the way you came and hang along the right wall this time. Through a small sludge puddle, past the junk pile sitting in the middle of nowhere is a small camp. Under a red tarp is the last Journal, number 493.

Strategy[]
Crazy Earl is mad at bandits and wants retribution. Bandits stole his C-Charge, so he wants them killed with it. After accepting the mission, start heading deeper into the scrapyard. Immediately, 3 spiderants will emerge and attack. Keep heading straight, passing some bandits near a weapon chest. After, you will come out to a walkway overlooking a new area. Make a long jump to reach Red Chest sitting on a platform, jump back, and head down the walkway to the revive point. From here, go around the north end of this area in order to reach more bandits and the C4.
Further down the path, there is a barricade with a revive point on top, guarded by some bandits. Go on top and jump over it. Stay along the left wall of this area and in the second bandit house, in the southern tip of the scrapyard, is the C-Charge. It is located in the open warehouse type building, on a box outside. Keep moving forward and head up the ramp up onto some walkways. Take the first left, heading up more. Turn left again and head straight; go through a house with 2 lockers outside and onto a large platform. Kill any bandits found there. Follow the waypoint to the C-Charge plant location on the platform and step back as it blows up. Before heading back, there are two red chests made accessible by the explosion. Head back to Crazy Earl for the reward.

Strategy[]
This Claptrap can be easily missed seeing as there are no other missions that send adventurers up this branch of Earl's Scrapyard. There is a fork in the road a short distance beyond Earl's home, and the Claptrap is beyond the left turn to the north-east.
The Repair Kit is very easy to locate as well, as it is located on a ledge overlooking the area that the Claptrap is in. While the intuitive path is to head all the way around the circuit to reach it, there is a much faster method of retrieving the Repair Kit. There are several objects in the junk pile below the kit that can be used as stepping stones to jump up onto the raised area where the Repair Kit lies.

Objectives[]
Eliminate Reaver and report back to New Haven.
Reaver killed
Strategy[]
Once in Krom's Canyon, a map marker to the right fork from the entrance denotes the way to Reaver. There are two groups of spiderants to contend with before fighting against the bandits. Some bandits will initially attack on the ground however most are up in raised areas of the canyon walls. The final encounter area for Reaver is just beyond a barricade that can be removed by way of a lever to the left of it.
Inside this area is another bandit ambush before the fight with Reaver himself. Reaver is concealed in a cave at the back of the area and will emerge when the cave is approached. He fights with Reaver's Edge, a sniper rifle that keeps his fire rate low, so any sort of knockback attack can be especially useful against him.
He is not overly durable, so it is possible to just murder him while he emerges from the cave.

Strategy[]
This is a follow the way point to the objective mission.
The first scripture in the north-western corner of Rust Commons East, directly north from the Middle of Nowhere. The bandit shrine is below the hill on which several huts are located and next to the waters where spiderants spawn. When the scripture is burned, multiple spiderants will begin to spawn.
The second scripture is through the tunnel by the Middle of Nowhere outpost, then north. Burning the scripture will cause psychos of all sorts to spawn from the nearby huts.
The third is south of the Middle of Nowhere outpost. They are all in a hut/house structure.

Objectives[]
Find all of the shotgun parts.
Shotgun Body
Shotgun Magazine
Shotgun Stock
Shotgun Barrel
Strategy[]
Hop in a runner and travel to the area marked on the map.
Magazine: It is located on top of the structure just behind the Catch-a-ride. Park at the station, go through the fence, on immediate right are boxes to jump on. Jump onto the brown structure.
Stock: It is on a box on the other side of the water. Go across the metal cat walk and the stock should be visible on a crate next to the building. Use that crate to jump onto the roof.
Barrel: It is on top of the structure which is next to the vending machines. From here face exactly NE and the last piece is visible on top of another structure.
Body: It is on a structure which is similar to the structure the magazine was on. From the top of the structure where the barrel was, make a running jump to the domed building on the right (while facing the water) and then do a running jump onto the platform. This can be complicated and may take a few tries but it is possible. It can be made easier by equipping an high explosive gun, approaching the run-up from the domed roof looking downwards, then firing the gun mid-jump.The jump can be made easier with Brick: the faster movement while Berserk translates to a further jump.
An easier approach is to get on the other side of the fence by going back across the water, down and across the water again and back up. Approach the end of the fence where it goes into the rocks and jump as if trying to get on top of the end of the fence. Landing point is half-way up, but from there it is possible to jump onto the top of the fence, then just walk across the fence to the structure with the shotgun body. This approach can activate a distant turret, but it can either be ignored or taken out.
An even easier approach is to get near to the building and jump until the Green Trophy sign can be seen. As soon as it shows up (usually during mid jump) simply press X (on 360) as it appears and grab it.

Strategy[]
Acquire the mission from the bounty board, follow the way point markers, collect the Data Recorders, turn in the mission, and apply blunt force trauma to your head.
Get a car from the Catch-A-Ride and go to the map marker near the South Drawbridge. To the right of the drawbridge is a small house, behind it is a small cardboard box that can be flipped over to reveal the data recorder concealed underneath. There are no visible marks pointing to it.
Head back towards the bounty board, but keep left, near the wall on the west side of the map. Journal #616 is hidden under a large mushroom cap. Scythids at this location will attack anyone who approaches.
Follow the waterway northeast to a small camp. Hidden spiderants will spring out of the ground to attack here. There is a red weapon crate, and #653 hidden behind the cot that's turned on its side against the rock.
Journal #684 is in the small watchtower at the North Drawbridge. A metal plate leaning against the interior wall of the tower can be dropped away to reveal the journal.
Head back to the Middle-of-Nowhere bounty board, go upstairs and into the shack on top where Hudson Johns is standing outside. Journal #718 is hidden in between the big box and the outside wall behind Hudson Johns.

Objectives[]
Talk to Chuck Durden.
Chuck Durden met
Strategy[]
The Circle of Slaughter lies to the south of the Outeryard. Using the Outeryard as a start point, simply grab a Runner and drive south to the barricade entrance to a bandit camp near the arena. There are spiderants hidden in the road along the way, but these will not emerge unless the travel pace is slow. Activating the boost allows the Runner to rocket past the spawn points without a fight.
The barricade screening off the bandit camp from the road is easily negotiated on foot, and progress through the area will draw the attention of a number of bandits. This is also the area in which the submachine gun parts for the Scavenger: Submachine Gun mission are located.
A gate at the far end of the camp remains closed throughout much of the fight, although this will open once combat has progressed close to it and the bandits in the hollow have been despatched.
Turning in the mission disables the bandit spawns in this area and future progress to the arena gate can be conducted challenge free.

It's kill or be killed!
Round survived
Strategy[]
This is another circle arena match, only this time the opponents are men with guns. An ammo vendor is located just outside, offering supplies for the coming fight.
When the arena is entered the gate will slam shut and the match begins. Several cages around the edge of the enclosure drop to the arena floor and release a number of Bandit Raiders and axe-wielding Psychos. There is some cover available that can be used to block the raiders' line of sight while the psychos get in close.
Using Proximity Mines[]
Because a round will only start if you've accepted its related quest, you can safely enter the arena before accepting the quest. Thus it is possible to plant Proximity Mines around the spawn points of the Bandits. It is even possible to drop all your grenades at each cage, run out, buy some more, then drop a second batch of Proximity Mines in the area. You can then run out, accept the quest and re-enter the arena to start the match before the Mines' two-minute timer causes them to explode. When the cages drop, you'll immediately be causing damage or even killing some of the Bandits right at the start of the fight.

Round survived
Strategy[]
Round 2 is strategically much the same as Round 1, however the opposition is bigger and nastier. This time the cages will release a number of Bruisers and Badass Bruisers, so taking cover to cut down the number of opponents in view will help with this mission immensely. When some of the larger enemies have been eliminated they will be joined by several midgets.
As with the previous round, it is possible to plant proximity mines around the spawn points of the bandits before accepting the mission. The grenades can be dropped at each cage, and more can be acquired at the vending machines to lay a second batch in the area. There will be enough time to run out, accept the mission and re-enter the arena to start the match.

Objectives[]
It's kill or be killed!
Round survived
Strategy[]
Despite being a level 28 mission, even higher levels can have a bit of trouble with this quest. Your character will likely be sustaining damage from many directions, so it is highly recommended that as many defensive options are explored as possible. Seeking cover is very important, and health restorative skills and equipment can be very helpful here.
The first round of cages dropped into the arena will release Badass Bruisers and Bandit Raiders. In addition, a gate at each side of the arena and near the entrance will release a Badass Bruiser then another upon the first one's defeat. Mutant Midget Psychos will join the fray once some of these are defeated, while the remaining cages will drop more bandits into the fray as more enemies are slain. Long-range weapon choices are usually the best weapon options, allowing one to stay in optimal covered positions and still train fire to much of the arena effectively.

I'm talkin' about the best food on Pandora, canned skag meat! Only problem is, Krom likes it, too, and he hijacked my entire supply! Make yourself useful! Go on out to Krom's Canyon and hijack it back.""","Video walkthrough
Cans of skag meat are scattered throughout the right-hand branch of Krom's Canyon. Waypoint markers denote the locations of the cans, and once all ten have been collected, the mission can be turned in to Earl.
Objectives[]
Collect cans of skag meat from Krom's Canyon, then return to Earl.
Canned skag meat: 0/10
Strategy[]
Cans of skag meat are scattered throughout the right-hand branch of Krom's Canyon. They are marked on the attached map with green dots.
The skag meat is all located in right-hand branch of the canyon. The first can is past two nests of spiderants at the base of a ramp with a New-U Station respawn point. The second is up on the plateau beyond. The third is beyond the ramp to the right, before crossing over to the next plateau. There, near a broken Claptrap, is the fourth can. The fifth and six cans are located on either side of the nearby bridge. There is a tower to the left after the bridge that requires a leap off the cliff and onto the tower to reach the seventh can. Reaver's encampment contains the final three cans, two cans on boxes and one in front of a dumpster.

Objectives[]
Find the repair kit and repair this Claptrap.
Repair kit
Strategy[]
In order to locate the Claptrap, take the right fork at Krom's Canyon entrance. Follow along this path until a ramp leading up is reached. There is also a large skull/grenade logo painted on the rock wall right by the ramp. Head up this ramp to a small open area where some bandits must be dealt with.
Fighting some bandits along the way, continue to the west and across the metal ramps/bridges to a plateau on the other side. Continue a little to the southwest to find the Claptrap laying on the ground.
To retrieve the repair kit, head east from the Claptrap, crossing a bridge over the canyon. This bridge and area on the other side is protected by a group of bandits. Once on the other side, a small platform with a few boxes and a can of skag meat on it can be seen. Jump onto the platform with the boxes. From here jump to one of the platforms on the tower shaped building, then jump to the second platform. The repair kit is hanging from an overhead beam.
Once the repair kit has been retrieved, return to the Claptrap. Be sure to hang around after he is repaired as he will open a shack with a red weapons chest in it.

Objectives[]
Reactivate both beacon towers.
North Ridge beacon activated
Overlook beacon activated
Strategy[]
The North Ridge beacon is located along the western side of Rust Commons East, and just south of the Underpass. Much of the distance to the beacon site can be covered by a Runner before heading through the encampment on foot. Bandits will ambush from various points around the installation. The switch to reactivate the beacon lies on the far side of the camp from the entrance.
The Overlook beacon is located in the eastern portion of the Rust Commons East, and just north of Jaynistown. Take a Runner to the beacon site before heading through the encampment on foot. Bandits will ambush from various points around the installation. The switch to reactivate the beacon lies on the far side of the camp from the entrance.
In both cases, the cliff top beacon sites overlook the Middle of Nowhere. One method of completing this mission is to throw the switch and simply dive off the cliff before running back to the Middle of Nowhere. This method is helpful if the Runner used to reach the site is no longer available, or if the bandit opposition becomes too intense to fight back out of. The path back to the Middle of Nowhere is clear enough for a relatively safe run.
Return to Helena Pierce for the reward.
Completion[]
""Here's your payment for services rendered. Now that those beacons are active again, hopefully somebody other than Atlas Corp. can access the interplanetary communications network. Getting back in touch with the neighboring systems should do wonders for the local economy.""

To test my theory, I need samples both from The Retching Seeps and The Fetid Cauldron. I'd do it myself, but each location is guarded by a nasty spiderant! Eliminate these nuisances, and I'll be able to conduct further tests without the need for assistance.""","Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Collect sulphur samples and kill Helob and Widowmaker.
Retching Seeps sample
Widowmaker killed
Fetid Cauldron sample
Helob killed
Strategy[]
The Retching Seeps is right outside of Old Haven, by the bridge. It will be flashing green. When interacted with,it triggers the emergence of Widowmaker from the earth.
The easiest way to kill Widowmaker is to splatter it with an Outrunner. The vehicle will be heavily damaged, but Widowmaker will be dead. The next location is south of the Cauldron Fast Travel, which follows the same exact pattern as this one. Get the sample, splatter the spiderant and return to the bounty board for the reward.
Helob can be blown over a nearby cliff with the effect of Sledge's Shotgun, providing experience but not loot.
A machine gun Outrunner can be positioned so that both the main turret and the front gun are pointed at the spiderants when they erupt from the ground. Continued firing from both turrets will catch them in a cycle of stun and cause them to constantly shift back and forth, allowing easy shots to the abdomen without having to leave the vehicle or let off of the fire buttons. Exiting the vehicle to finish off the spiderants will yield maximum rewards with minimum ammunition expenditure.
An alternate strategy for those who wish to fight these named spiderants on foot is to get close to Widowmaker or Helob while positioning a large obstacle in the way of the spiderant. The intervening object will often block the spiderants from pouncing on a character and also block their ranged attacks. Proximity or contact grenades can still be used while bobbing around the obstacle to speed up damage dealing.
Because spiderants take time to turn, a quickly moving character can easily shoot at their exposed abdomens.
A good strategy for this battle is to use a corrosive weapon as the continuous corrosive damage will daze Helob allowing for easy shots to the weak abdomen.
Completion[]
""Excellent work! I will begin testing these samples right away. Perhaps this study will eventually lead to profitable agriculture on Pandora! Here is your reward for helping an old chemist with his bug problem.""

Objectives[]
Collect pamphlets from the bandits at Old Lynne Abbey.
Pamphlets: 0/6
Strategy[]
Old Lynne Abbey is located close to the Cauldron Fast Travel terminal. There is a revive point outside of the area. The gate to the church grounds is cracked open just enough so an Outrunner cannot pass through.
Once inside the gate, a group of bandits will ambush on the approach to the church building. Each one carries a pamphlet that will be dropped when they die, so this mission is simply a matter of walking into a gun fight and retrieving the mission objective drops.
As a supplementary reward, there is also a red chest next to a Med Vendor inside the church.

If they're going to be killing indiscriminately, you need to defuse their little trap before New Haven residents get hurt. Fight your way through Old Haven and put out their smoke signals. I'll reward you well once the job is done.""","Video walkthrough
Objectives[]
Shut down the four smoke signals in Old Haven, then return to Helena Pierce.
Apartment District
Canal District
Junkyard
Rooftops
Strategy[]
This mission is unique in that it is the only storyline mission in which no indicators appear on the HUD compass to mark the location of the mission objectives. Instead, each objective is marked by a rising column of smoke. At the base of each smoke signal is a burning pile of tires and debris, and activating a lever close to each pile lowers a lid to extinguish them. The smoke signals are arranged around the periphery of Old Haven and are most easily accessed by traversing the area in a clockwise circuit; north-east (Apartment District), south-east (Canal District), south-west (Junkyard) and north-west (Rooftops).
Also on the clockwise path are objectives for the mission Bandit Treasure: Three Corpses, Three Keys, the first being a trio of bandit corpses to the north where the mission is obtained. This mission can be done in conjunction with shutting down the smoke signals with the various keys found spaced between smoke signal locations.
Old Haven can be a tough area for the unprepared, as it is garrisoned by a large contingent of Crimson Lance. Movement through the town is best carried out using urban combat techniques, such as the judicious use of cover and elevation, use of grenades and long-range weapons, and the tactic of clearing one area before continuing to the next. The use of corrosive weapons is recommended. In addition to the Lance soldiers an elevated pair of Gatling Turrets cover the Apartment District and another well-guarded pair cover the Canal District, making an open-ground approach difficult.

""Thank you, here's the reward I promised. By the way, I contacted Steele. Without mentioning your name, I told her there was an attack on 'New Haven residents.'

1st Bandit Key
2nd Bandit Key
3rd Bandit Key
Strongbox found
Strategy[]
In Old Haven are some bandit corpses strewn about in front of a wall near a water tower. One of them holds a journal which gives clues to a hidden bandit treasure trove.
More keys are scattered around several locations in Old Haven. It is advisable to do this mission in tandem with Smoke Signals: Shut Them Down and pick up the keys between the smoke signal objectives. The first key is conveniently located right next to the journal. The second key is in the north of the area and the third key can be found beyond the canal to the west.
Reaching the keys involves passing through Old Haven's contingent of Crimson Lance soldiers. Corrosive weapons are very effective here and the urban environments near the keys provide opportunities for both long range and close combat.

Strategy[]
Take a Runner from Lucky's Last Chance Watering Hole and head for the cliffs in the north. A hidden catwalk descends down the cliff face for a short distance leading eventually to a locked shed. Unlocking the shed will allow access to a red weapons chest inside.
The weapons found in the chest vary, but may include Eridian weapons, or class mods. Although the completion message says ""there is also a kick-ass gun"", it is quite possible for the chest to contain no guns at all, only class mods, shields and/or grenade mods. Even when it does contain weapons there is no guarantee that they will be of exceptional quality.

Strategy[]
Stance Von Kofsky is the mission provider for Green Thumb. From the Middle of Nowhere in Rust Commons East, a quick ride along the river to a large broken pipe with a giant sunflower underneath it, reveals the location of Stance Von Kofsky and his isolated shack.
Once the mission is accepted, the map marker guides the way to the east side of Rust Commons East to the valve. A small bandit camp is set up near the valve. The water pump, where the valve handle needs to be attached, can be found at Jaynistown, and this area is likewise team with bandits.

Objectives[]
Sink the Righteous Man, Great Vengeance, and Furious Anger.
Righteous Man sunk
Great Vengeance sunk
Furious Anger sunk
Strategy[]
There are three gunboats moored around Treacher's Landing. Each ship can be quickly spotted by their sail with bandit emblems on them. The Righteous Man carries a sail depicting a cherub armed with a repeater and a grenade, the Great Vengeance sports a smiley faced bomb, and the Furious Anger has a dirty, cracked skull on display.
The Righteous Man can be found north/northwest of the map's concrete dock, while the Great Vengeance is moored halfway down the dock. The Furious Anger can be found northeast from the concrete docks, moored between the south-center structures and the path that leads to the hidden boat.
The boats can be quickly dispatched by shooting at the fuel tanks at the stern. Destroying the fuel tanks will cause an explosion that sinks the boat.
The gunboats are armed with Mulciber Mk2 gatling guns. The turrets' operators can be killed, rather than destroying the guns themselves, but invisible boundaries around the boats will prevent access, thus preventing the turrets from being commandeered for use by the player.
Because of the range and firepower of the Mulcibers, using sniper rifles can be an effective way of dealing with the boats. There are many elevated areas in Treacher's Landing providing unobstructed line of sight to the boats and their fuel tanks.

Objectives[]
Find the repair kit and repair this Claptrap.
Repair Kit
Strategy[]
The damaged Claptrap is found in a bandit camp south of the vending machines, a little inland from a beach house. Nearby Larva Crab Worms will pose a minor obstacle before reaching the encampment, and once in the camp itself, bandits will also attack. The crab worms and bandits will be hostile to each other, leaving the options of either fighting them sequentially as normal, or playing them off against each other.  Another strategy is to bring Bleeder into the bandit camp as well, since he is a respawning boss.  The bandits will also be hostile to Bleeder.
The Repair Kit is deceptively hidden on top of the sewage pipe that runs through the Trash Coast. In order to get to on the top of the pipe to retrieve it, locate the other end of the pipe to jump on to it. There are two possible paths. The northern path is the shorter of the two, although the southern path can also be taken on the way to completing Bait And Switch.
The alternative to tracing a circuitous route is to scale the debris near the bandit camp. While this can be accomplished it can also lead to frustration with repeated failed attempts that result in characters sliding back to the ground. The less direct approach to this strategy is to climb the ramp leaning against the containers (near the broken claptrap), and then jump onto the adjacent hut and then the rock thereafter. From there, jump to the huge trash pile, and onto the pipe.
The large pile of debris by the last bend in the pipe line can be scaled fairly quickly and easily. The location is on the left of the entrance to the bandit camp. It is much easier and faster than walking around and looking for the start of the pipe line.

Objectives[]
Go to the Trash Coast and kill Bleeder.
Bleeder killed
Strategy[]
Bleeder is found in the lower portion of the Trash Coast map. From the transition point, down the eastern side under the overhead pipeline.
It is best to deal with the lesser scythids first and then focus on Bleeder himself. He does not deal much damage but has a rather large amount of health and is constantly moving which makes him difficult to kill. Go on top of the pipeline that the Claptrap repair kit is retrieved from. If done properly, Bleeder will not surface until the player is on top of the pipeline, and will not move around at all, allowing for an easy kill. Scythids are usually weak against melee attacks as well. This makes the use of melee attacks a viable, albeit more dangerous, tactic to quickly defeating Bleeder.

Claptrap leads the way to Knuckle Dragger in an icy box canyon. Knuckle Dragger behaves like most other Bullymongs, leaping about and hurling rocks, although once reduced to half health she retreats and a wave of Monglets attack. Once killed, she drops Claptrap's eye.
When Claptrap's eye is retrieved from the dead Bullymong, Claptrap leads the way to Liar's Berg and Sir Hammerlock.

Strategy[]
Liar's Berg has been overrun by bandits, and these intruders must be cleaned out of the area, but first there are several small bullymongs in the way. They will try to close the distance with any attacker to strike at point blank range, and if attacked from the top of the cliff they will leap up to retaliate. The bullymongs pose little threat at a distance however.
The bandits are relatively weak targets and fight with small arms from among the sparse buildings of Liars Berg. When approached however, a new complication arises when some more bullymongs arrive and attack the bandits and Vault Hunters alike. They can be played off against each other simply by hanging back out from the action, and this makes it an easy matter to whittle down both group evenly by attacking the winning side.
With the enemies out of the way, Sir Hammerlock emerges and attends to Claptrap.

Strategy[]
This mission primarily involves following Claptrap through bandit territory to reach a boat. Initially this means moving through territory occupied by bandits, and is broken by two significant boss encounters.
The first major fight is with Boom and Bewm, which consist of two small, armored targets. Despite this, they do not have any resistance against fire damage or weakness to corrosive damage. It is possible to start the fight without entering the arena, by edging up to the drop into the arena Vault Hunters can trigger the fight, then withdraw to the surrounding buildings and snipe. Boom starts the battle atop a giant cannon called Big Bertha. This cannon will rotate slowly, so its fire can be outrun or avoided by keeping to cover as much as possible. Damage inflicted on this cannon will eventually reduce its structure to around 10% health, whereupon Boom will leap down and personally enter the fray. It is also possible to deal enough damage to kill Boom and the cannon at the same time. Boom's brother Bewm is equipped with a jet pack and will present an awkward target as he jets through the air and attacks from a high vantage. Both of them will attack with grenades, providing even more incentive to stay on the run. These flights are short lived however, and he spends much of his time attacking on foot. Killing either Boom or Bewm will cause two psychos at a time to spawn until the other boss is killed. These psychos can provide second winds. The character may be safer standing their ground against the psychos if Big Bertha is still operational as running from them will expose themselves to its fire.
After Boom and Bewm are defeated and Big Bertha is used to blow up the gate, a large number of bandits will enter. They can be fought on foot, but using Big Bertha to kill them is far easier as the Vault Hunter who operates Big Bertha, and the cannon itself, are both invincible.
Claptrap will be missing as soon as the gate is destroyed. Vault Hunters must follow the way point to find Claptrap being beaten by three bandits. A short while later, Claptrap's progress is halted by stairs and he must be hoisted aloft from a mechanism above. This entails fighting through more bandits to reach the switch. Once up, Claptrap will then open the way to the final boss encounter against Captain Flynt.
The fight against Flynt and his cronies takes place on top of the freighter deck. Flynt will remain on his perch and watch his lackeys throw themselves into the fray before descending to the deck himself after Vault Hunters either get close enough, hit him once, or all Marauders are killed. He attacks with a flamethrower that will quickly deplete shields. His critical hit location is his exposed head behind his mask, requiring attackers to flank him to exploit his weakness. He also has an ability to slam his anchor in the ground and knock characters back multiple times. Like other nomads, he also has a powerful charging attack.
While there are many walls and obstacles to provide cover from the Captain's grenades and flames, Vault Hunters should be careful not to stand on the exposed grilles that will erupt with fire partway through the battle. When Flynt is engulfed in flames from the grilles on deck, he gains massive damage resistance and can reflect projectiles, making it preferable to seek cover until the flames die out.
It is possible to retreat to the lower area (or simply die) and return to the last checkpoint, where there is more cover, while Flynt and his minions must stand, exposed, on the metal beams jutting from the ship. Additionally, it is possible to shoot him from the walkway leading up to his ship while he stands on his perch.
After Flynt's defeat, Claptrap will lead the way through the freighter to find his actual ""ship"" (a boat), behind it and must board to complete the mission.

The mission begins in Three Horns - Divide on board Claptrap's ship. He will offer a long set of specifications for his welcome back party in Sanctuary. Angel will then make contact, stating that Pandora is a dangerous place, and Sanctuary is somewhat less so.
Angel encourages the use of a vehicle to reach Sanctuary, although once the nearest Catch-A-Ride station is reached it becomes apparent that it is non-functional because Scooter locked it to prevent the Bloodshots from using them to spawn Bandit Technical's. An adapter must be procured from a nearby Bloodshot camp.
With the adapter installed, the Catch-a-Ride proves to have been locked against the possibility of use by bandits. Angel then hacks the system, allowing it to digistruct a Runner, and this is then used to jump across a gap severing the road to Sanctuary.
Lt. Davis greets the new arrivals at the gates of Sanctuary, and patches them through to Roland. Roland requests that a power core be obtained that can power the city's shields, and sends the Vault Hunters back down the road to find Cpl. Reiss.
After obtaining clues to Reiss's whereabouts, he is discovered under attack by bandits. In his final moments, he tells that one of the Bloodshots has the power core. The next marker indicates the general location of these bandits, and an optional objective to kill 20 of them also appears on the HUD. Entering the area and staying to the left is the safest and quickest way to obtain the power core or clean out the area for loot.
After the core is retrieved, Davis will open the Sanctuary gate. The mission is then turned in to him just outside the city.

Buying an item from the Black Market will only be required on the first play-through in Normal Mode. In subsequent modes, the objective to buy the third power cell will be skipped (although Scooter will still provide a 4-block of Eridium), and it can be installed immediately.
The power cells are then taken to the center of Sanctuary and installed. After Scooter warns that ""this city's gonna FLY!"" the ground will rumble, but Scooter's ""plan B"" did not work as intended, and the ship's central engine stalled.

Strategy[]
After accepting the mission, the path to Frostburn Canyon will be highlighted. Access to the Canyon is in Three Horns - Divide and protected by the outpost of the gang of Children of the Firehawk; its garrison is made up of several bandits and a pair of nomads with flamethrowers. Once in Frostburn Canyon, the objective is to follow seven signs (Psychos pinned to a post pointing in a certain direction) until arriving at the Lair of the Firehawk.
The path with the seven signs winds through the Frostburn Canyon map, first traveling through some bandit-infested trails and a large camp with lots of burning psychos and the regular assortment of other bandit types. The path continues through a series of caves and trails filled with bandits and spiderants.
Not all seven signs need to be followed. If a player takes the route opposite to the first objective when arriving in Frostburn Canyon and instead heads through the areas with the spiderants, the third sign will be reached without having seen the first two. The objectives to find the first second and third signs will all simultaneously complete.
After the sixth sign there will be one badass psycho followed by another that come out of the cave, which one can outrun instead of fight. In that final stretch of cave a number of pipes protruding from the walls and ceilings prove to be booby traps that shoot jets of flame. These can be avoided by stepping around the fringe of the flame jet, or by waiting for the flame to subside.
Upon arrival at the Firehawk's Lair, it becomes apparent that Lilith is the Firehawk. She then immediately comes under attack from bandits and requests assistance fighting off several waves of bandits, consisting of psychos, crazed marauders and at least two badass psychos. The bandits pour in from the adjoining platforms and attempt to converge on the central platform while Lilith uses her phase blasts to combat them. Lilith's phase blasts can distract the bandits, but they will rarely do enough damage to kill any.
Following the fight, Lilith attempts to teleport the Vault Hunters to Bloodshot Stronghold, but only manages a short range jump within her lair, at which point she changes her plan and returns to Sanctuary.

“Ever considered the exciting field of cleaning up my messes?”To meet Borderlands quality standards, this article or section may require cleanup.Please help by improving, spell-checking and/or trimming the article.
The mission is broken into several stages spanning several areas of Borderlands 2.
In order to gain entry to the Bloodshot Stronghold from Three Horns - Valley, a vehicle must be driven up to the Bloodshot gate and the horn sounded to signal those inside. Momentarily duped by the ruse, the Bloodshot gang begin lowering the gate, but attack when Flanksteak realizes that the vehicle outside is not one of the bandits' technicals.
Scooter suggests an alternative strategy to drive to The Dust and meet Ellie, a big girl with a ""large personality"". Ellie explains that one needs to gather parts from the bandits' cars so she can build a vehicle capable of passing for one used by the Bloodshots.
With the Bandit Technical acquired, the Bloodshot gang is easily duped into opening the gate, but entry to the complex itself is again blocked, this time by Bad Maw. Bad Maw is a slow-moving adversary, mostly hidden behind a formidable metal shield. Heavy damage directed on the shield will cause it to be pushed aside, opening Bad Maw up for attack, but otherwise explosive attacks, elemental effect damage, and simple repositioning may be required to bring him down. When killed, Bad Maw drops a key to access the Stronghold.
Bandits inhabit the entirety of the complex, ensuring the search for Roland is an eventful one. Another boss encounter must be negotiated through at Satan's Suckhole when Mad Mike enters the fray over the whirlpool. Mad Mike will always be armed with a rocket launcher and grenades, and can use these to devastating effect. Attackers may need to move quickly to avoid these attacks, or seek cover quickly when he appears. He will stay directly above the entrance area on the top level, but will come out on the catwalk where a few well-placed rockets will dispatch him quickly.
Roland is found in a holding cell near the end of the facility, but as soon as he is freed, a constructor designated W4R-D3N arrives to capture him and bear him away.
The chase leads to the Bloodshot Ramparts where Hyperion is fighting the Bloodshot gang. Hyperion has deployed various loaders and surveyors, and these robotic adversaries are frequently engaged in battle with the Bloodshots in the early stages of the conflict.
The final encounter is a multi-stage battle, and the first stage is to defeat W4R-D3N and free Roland. W4R-D3N has powerful shields that need to be battered down before any damage can be inflicted on its structure.
A strategy for killing W4R-D3N is to run up close and do as much damage to its critical hit spot as possible, using the loaders scattered around for Second Winds if needed. Lilith will shout a warning when time is running low. Quitting the game and continuing will cause the timer to be reset and Vault Hunters will spawn at the exit-only fast travel near the W4R-D3N.
If Roland is not rescued in time, the drop barge will take W4R-D3N and its captive to Friendship Gulag which is reached by fast travel to The Dust. In this location, W4R-D3N will take up a station near the holding cells at the back of the facility forcing another fight through Hyperion forces to reach it. The resulting fight against W4R-D3N is similar to the one at Bloodshot Ramparts, but with the longer distances available, longer-ranged sniping tactics can be employed. A supplementary objective to destroy some waves of loaders will also arise, and these must be cleared before the mission can be turned in to Roland.

The first objective after saving Roland in previous chapter is to go back to Sanctuary and speak with him about how to defeat Jack. Then go to talk to Rolands spy, located in Tundra Express.
After arriving in Tundra Express, the next objective is to awaken Roland's spy Mordecai by lighting three varkids on fire simultaneously. Low damage incendiary guns can be used, although it is often simpler to employ area effect fire damage from a grenade or a fire nova shield. Incinerators located throughout the Tundra Express can quickly ignite all the varkids at once, however any Vault Hunter caught in their area of effect may sustain lethal damage.
The next objective is to meet with Tiny Tina and recover two explosives from the Buzzard Academy. After their return and Tina's operations, ""Put a small bomb in the hot ass"", the two explosives bunnies must be taken to the top of a building where they must be set off. After arming the charges, the destroyed train track creates a bridge to End of the Line. Snowblind Defile is populated with loaders and the occasional surveyor, before giving way to Terminus Plateau where the culmination of the mission takes place.
The plateau appears to be uninhabited, but when a wrecked train carriage in the middle is approached, it is cast aside and Wilhelm emerges from the wreckage.
Wilhelm is an armored target with high health, and while initially unshielded, he periodically digistructs Surveyors and Shield Surveyors that can heal him or grant such shields. He can also throw away nearby train carriages to unearth the loaders stuck underneath. The surveyors will heal Wilhelm and regenerate his shield, while the rescued loaders provide him with additional fire support. Wilhelm also possesses a powerful melee attack and can inflict serious harm if he manages to close distance with a Vault Hunter. Occasionally he will launch himself into the air towards the Vault Hunter's location, and will spin his upper body around in circles, knocking the Vault Hunter back. This is very dangerous as he can knock Vault Hunters off the cliff, but can present others with an opportunity to engage. Otherwise, his primary ranged attack is to launch missiles and grenades.
Being armored, Wilhelm is largely immune to fire weapons, but not corrosive ones. His shield can be rapidly depleted with shock damage, and Slag is equally effective against him as most common enemies. The ledge overlooking Terminus Plateau provides a convenient position for a sniper as Wilhelm doesn't go up there.
At the beginning of the fight, Wilhelm has a tendency to stand or walk in a small area, focusing on digistructing his surveyors. This leaves him vulnerable to corrosive cloud grenades. Because he remains standing in the grenade status effect cloud for a lengthy time, this tactic can drain his health faster than his surveyors can heal him.

At Lt. Davis's urging, a freshly acquired Hyperion power core is installed in the shield generator, but it turns out to be a trap by Handsome Jack. The core catches Davis in an explosion and kills him before Jack makes Angel shut down Sanctuary's shields and make it exposed for bombardment.
The only recourse is to get the city airborne, and to this end Scooter requests assistance with cycling two of the city's three ignition primers. Lilith's siren talents are also required, but before Roland can bring the Eridium she needs, one of the blasts hits the Crimson Raider headquarters, forcing any other Vault Hunters to make the run to the store room.
Once Lilith has the Eridium, she phases the entire city to a new location, but in doing so, her power also accidentally teleports the Vault Hunters to a location a short distance outside the Sanctuary walls. From there they must make their way overland to Sanctuary's new location, and to that they need to gain entry to The Fridge.

With Sanctuary having vanished after the events of Rising Action, Angel contacts the Vault Hunters and expresses regret for her betrayal. She goes on to explain that Sanctuary has relocated some distance away and in order to reach it, the Vault Hunters will have to access a particular Fast Travel terminal closer to its current location, and then urges them to enter The Fridge.
Progress through the Fridge is not easy as the place is heavily populated with a thieving and cannibalistic bandit group known as the rats. They may not be the most sophisticated of Pandora's human dangers, but they make up for their moderate technology with tenacity and viciousness. The Rats have many fast-moving units, some of whom will stop to pick up loot drops that might otherwise be a much-needed source of supply.
Emerging into The Highlands - Outwash, the Vault Hunters are hit with a new problem: Sanctuary is no longer on the Fast Travel network, and this means an increasing series of objectives as each new destination becomes a momentary stop and a discovery of yet another objective.
Continuing through the area, the Vault Hunters reach a Hyperion-operated dam teeming with loaders and combat engineers. Upon reaching the main bridge, an EXP loader will attempt to block the crossing by destroying the bridge controls, if it is not destroyed before it can do this, then the river crossing must be done in an empty container.
Once on the other side, and through a gate, the next objective is to procure a lunar supply beacon, although this plan is deferred when a giant thresher appears and swallows the device. The Gluttonous Thresher's Shield can present an issue, but behaves similarly to other threshers, burrowing underground to reach targets with the same critical hit zones at the eyes.
The fight is made even more chaotic thanks to the presence of Hyperion forces within range. The three-way struggle can be controlled somewhat by using the Hyperion units as a distraction, while the thresher is targeted frequently in order to prevent it from regenerating its shield. Nearby buildings are also available for limited cover. As the buildings and large crates in the vicinity do not provide adequate cover from the thresher's close-range attacks, a retreat to safer ground may be appropriate for some characters. If lured back to the bridge, the thresher will only advance so far and will be limited to firing spikes at range
Once the thresher is killed, the beacon can be obtained, and the next phase is to reach a friendly settlement called Overlook, where the beacon can be safely deployed.
Again the situation changes when waves of loaders are dispatched to interrupt the beacon's deployment. Initially, a wave of basic loaders will march on the beacon in an attempt to destroy it, and then this is followed by heavier units in a second wave. A constructor is then deployed in a third phase of the attack. Each time the beacon is damaged to the point of failure it must be interacted with to repair it and resume the timer. The Hyperion forces are as much focused on the beacon as they are on the Vault Hunters, and will march on it incessantly, only pausing to engage in combat when coming under heavy fire.
Character-controlled vehicles positioned at the bottom of the slope have a clear line of fire up the main street, almost to the beacon. With multiple characters, the beacon can be defended with a constant barrage of vehicular weapons and even solo characters can benefit immensely from periodically mounting a vehicle to decimate waves of loaders marching up to the beacon.
By the time the loaders are destroyed, Jack is still denying the requisition order. Angel responds by cutting off the Hyperion satellite's life support. Fast Travel access is hastily arranged, putting Sanctuary back on the network. With that done, the Vault Hunters can return to Sanctuary.

Upon entering the Wildlife Exploitation Preserve, several groups of stalkers block the way to Mordecai. As with all stalkers, shock weaponry is very effective. At Mordecai's perch, he explains that Bloodwing has been captured and that the Claptrap upgrade was with Bloodwing. He lends aid by providing sniper support from his high vantage point.
The gate into the Hyperion complex is initially blocked, and to get it to open, some loaders will need to be damaged, but not destroyed. Otherwise, after a certain amount of time, the door will open. Once three have been reduced to half health, the gate will be opened for reinforcements to respond. It remains open from this point on and the remaining forces can be decimated.
Along the dock, a variety of loaders and Hyperion personnel will attack, along with surveyors, which should be prioritized. Corrosive weapons are a valuable asset when dealing with the high concentration of loaders. Beyond the dockyard is a spacious skag pen with only two exits: a ladder in a corner near the dockyard, and a broken pipe that has to be climbed to continue into the complex. Badass skags can randomly spawn in this area, making it a hazardous area to get through. There are more stalker and skags in the grassy region beyond, before reaching the next Hyperion structure.
Eventually, the battles with Hyperion forces and Pandoran fauna give way to the Specimen Maintenance facility. At this point, Jack releases a number of penned creatures. Two badass elemental skags will spawn here.
The remaining encounters consist of more Hyperion personnel and rogue creatures until these give way to the endgame boss fight. It's at this point that it is revealed how Bloodwing has been experimented on and become a giant Slagged Bloodwing. She now possesses various elemental damage types, and the first one unveiled is fire.
Slagged Bloodwing has a few forms of attack. In flight, she will either dive bomb prey (which can be avoided by evading when Mordecai shouts an alert), a claw attack (which can be avoided by running perpendicular to the bird), or breathe elemental projectiles (which can be outmaneuvered or blocked by cover). Sometimes Bloodwing also lands, where she can still perform powerful elemental and melee attacks. She also has a seldom-used defensive action by shielding herself with her wings. Bloodwing's critical hit location is her head, which can prove impossible to target most of the time when she's airborne.
After being reduced to 50% health, Jack imbues Bloodwing with shock. Bloodwing retains the same attacks, except with shock damage this time, and is also healed to 75% health. After being further injured to 25%, Jack imbues her with corrosion and again heals her to 50%. Reducing her health to 0% prior to the corrosive phase does not defeat her.
When the battle concludes, the bird is tranquilized by Mordecai in the hopes of healing her. Jack reveals the last power to be explosive and kills Bloodwing by detonating an explosive collar, enraging Mordecai. Bloodwing's defeat signals the end of the mission, making Claptrap's software upgrade available for retrieval and installation.

Upon reaching Thousand Cuts, the Vault Hunter is greeted by numerous bandits as well as buzzards. The buzzards provide a frequent source of harassment that causes a negative impact on shield recharge and are therefore a priority target. The section right before Brokeface Bridge often has a few badasses and goliaths. Goliaths are particularly useful if their helmets are shot off, allowing Vault Hunters to pass while they fight other enemies. Eliminating all opposition is not mandatory, as enemies outside will not follow into the king's stronghold.
Once inside, the Slab King takes the Vault Hunter as new a recruit and sends in a welcoming party: a 4-5 wave bandit assault. The King will not intervene in the fight and is accompanied by 2 passive Badass Goliaths, which will join the fight either when their helmets are shot off or during the last wave. Common bandits will appear, which are all easily dispatched with incendiary weapons. Occasionally, a Goliath can spawn, which can be used to distract the bandits. Alternatively, Vault Hunters can choose to enrage the Badass Goliaths early and dupe them into fighting other bandits, which can potentially finish all waves with minimal effort.
The Slab King reveals himself as Brick once the Vault Hunter has survived the initiation, and inducts them into his Slab gang.
After Brick agrees to help Roland and he’s in, Handsome Jack launches a surprise mortar attack on the Slabs, along with loaders. To halt Jack's attack on Thousand Cuts, the Vault Hunter and Brick must destroy the mortar beacons guiding the mortars. Upon approaching each mortar beacon, red targets appear where a mortar will soon strike. Brick approaches each mortar beacon in turn and breaks the shield, leaving them vulnerable to gunfire. Each destroyed beacon will unleash progressively tougher waves of loaders. Brick is invincible and can do massive melee damage to every enemy, so Vault Hunters should mostly leave the fight to him, though beware he doesn't distract enemies well.

Strategy[]
It is generally a good idea to get some powerful corrosive weaponry, as there are many loaders in Opportunity. Jack's Body Double has a relatively strong shield, so shock weapons can be helpful as well.
The body double is wandering a lower-level fountain plaza near Opportunity Square, and is remarkably oblivious; he will not react to any combat occurring around him (including bullet impacts only a few feet away from him) unless he actually takes damage or a Vault Hunter runs into his line of sight. Snipers may wish to hang back and pick off any engineers and loaders in the area before attempting to assassinate the double.
When he is finally triggered, Jack's Body Double will try to make a run to the nearby base (close to the nearest info kiosk). If he succeeds, he will occasionally launch a flare of a Hyperion logo to the sky, summoning reinforcements and prolonging the fight. The double has Badass-level health and a shield of nearly matching durability but is otherwise an unremarkable opponent.
When the body double is killed, a pocketwatch is dropped. Angel will then request some audio samples from kiosks scattered around the city. They are marked on the minimap, and all that needs to be done is to press the button. Once all the samples have been collected, the data can be uploaded to Angel.
The upload station entrance can be hard to find. It is located to the southwest of its marked location - approach East from Waterfront District or South from Hyperion Office Complex. The room with the upload station in it is located in a downstairs corridor. When nearing the correct door, a HOT Loader or a pair of Hyperion Snipers will open the door and walk out. The upload station console is inside on the right.

Strategy[]
Preparation of strong corrosive weapons and a moderately powerful shock weapon would be advisable, as almost all enemies encountered during this mission are armored foes with shielded Hyperion soldiers and surveyors. The only flesh targets are Hyperion snipers.
The first objective is to meet with Claptrap in Sanctuary and convince him to help in the fight with Handsome Jack. Follow into the Thousand Cuts, break through the attacking Hyperion forces, talk to the Claptrap and it leads the way through the ""Container Containment Field"". It will deactivate the field and allow the Vault Hunters to proceed.
The hill climb beyond the Containment Field is guarded by Hyperion personnel and loaders, with some automated gun turrets and air support from surveyors. Arrayed against them, Slab Support Buzzards also provide some air cover of their own. While not overly dangerous to the Hyperion force, the buzzards do present a distraction to help reduce fire on the Vault Hunters. At the end of the hill before the left turn, a constructor will always appear, and must be destroyed to proceed. When the gate opens, several Hyperion Soldiers will spawn.
Further up the hill, Hyperion commences a mortar bombardment, which Brick will warn the Vault Hunters of as the shells drop. The next gate can be opened by destroying the two turrets attached to both sides of it. At this point, more Hyperion loaders will appear, as well as more Hyperion soldiers and potentially a Hyperion sniper. The last barricade can be lifted by destroying the badass constructor, which should not be tough with the ample cover nearby. Vault Hunters should clear out the other enemies to prevent either them or the constructor from easily crippling them. After the badass constructor is destroyed, three more Hyperion soldiers will appear, which can be then dispatched with ease. The Bunker is straight ahead, while to the right is an empty area containing multiple Hyperion chests.
Upon entering The Bunker, Brick instructs the Vault Hunters to destroy the autocannons. A total of twelve must be taken down. These armored guns unleash strong bursts of heavy damage, though they usually target the buzzards instead and have easily accessible critical hit locations behind them. After the first is destroyed, loaders will begin spawning (only EXP, JET, GUN, and HOT loaders will appear) constantly. Destroying the autocannons will also result in the laser countermeasure activating for approximately 5~10 seconds, dealing damage when it comes into contact with the Vault Hunters. Lasers are not installed on the staircase as well as the lower levels. Alternatively, Vault Hunters can utilize elevated locations to avoid the lasers.
Brick's buzzards will occasionally drop ammo and health vials, and Brick will inform the Vault Hunters about the drops' location and type when this happens.
When the autocannons are destroyed, Handsome Jack reveals the real bunker, a giant robotic aircraft called the BNK3R. It is an armored target with the following attacks:
Launching a volley of homing missiles.
These can be avoided by hiding on the lower platforms or staying away from its line of sight, resulting in most of the missiles missing.
Firing powerful energy blasts from its mounted gun.
Brick will warn the Vault Hunters when this attack is about to be used.
This weapon has a large splash radius but low accuracy. The spread can be observed when hiding in cover as the bolts will hit random spots around its intended target.
This attack is only used after its health drops to around 70% or lower.
Projecting a volley of mortar shells.
These do explosive damage and are indicated by a red dome each. If not triggered, they will explode after a few seconds. They also drag a red tracer when airborne.
Brick will warn the Vault Hunters when this attack is about to be used.
Digistructing two autocannons on its body, which attack independently from the boss itself.
These autocannons are much weaker in health and can be shot off for second winds. If not destroyed, they will despawn when the boss retreats.
BNK3R soars around the arena from a distance and will only close in at fixed intervals, meaning that unless it is stationary, where most of its dangerous attacks are unleashed, it is practically invincible. While cruising, it will throw mortar shells. The rest of the attacks are only utilized when it strafes the Vault Hunters from either the left or the right side of the arena. When its health is extremely low, it will instead fly to the front of the area and stay there until defeated.
BNK3R has two readily accessible critical hit locations: A camera at the chin, and a cluster of optics in its front. Both are exposed for the entire duration of its strafing session, though dodging its attacks can be tricky in that case. Weapons that trade accuracy for power, such as shotguns, will be able to inflict significant damage even from the top area, where protection is offered against almost all of its attacks for most of the fight. Vault Hunters should mostly stay there unless their ammunition is running low, in which case a quick run through the supplies dropped by the Slabs or from ammo crates will keep the fight up for a little longer. Vendors are also available at the bottom of the structure, at the entrance to the map. This location is a good spot to both recover health and attack from, as mortars usually fall short of the railing, and loaders rarely venture down below the ring around the central platform. However, in Singleplayer, this may occasionally lead to the boss respawning unintentionally, resetting the fight progress as it recovers all lost health.
Once BNK3R is defeated, it will flinch in mid-air for a few seconds, then crash and drop loot. The barrier blocking access to Control Core Angel as well as to a Hyperion chest at the back of the area will be both deactivated. As ammunition supply is not plentiful in the next fight, Vault Hunters might consider restocking, as well as selling excess loot from the boss.
Angel summoning ammunition
Control Core Angel lies deep within the Hyperion installation and is reached by a deep elevator shaft. Angel remains captive in the middle of the expansive chamber, and asks that the three Eridium injectors be destroyed. The injectors are soon revealed to be shielded and further protected by stationary turrets digistructed from overhead supports, Shock Field Generators on the floor that deal damage in lightning discharges, and waves of loaders. The shock field generators are armored (despite the red health bar) and can be easily destroyed via gunfire, after which they do not respawn. The ironclad core defense turrets do devastating incendiary damage and should be taken out quickly before they inflict serious harm. Loaders, on the other hand, are the main sources of damage and the primary opponents within the area. The loaders that appear will consist of Angelic Guards, GUN, ION, SGT, WAR, and badass loaders.
The floor of the chamber presents a dangerous place to fight with all of these hazards but also provides room to move and dodge. The only source of cover is the dome where Angel is kept captive – it separates the arenas into a ring and can be utilized to block most attacks. At various stages, Angel will also summon ammunition crates, and restock the oldest ones. The ledge at the door is a much safer place to fight, and much of the damage from the loaders can be avoided by crouching, but the drawback to remaining in this position is the lack of ammunition resupply.
Roland enters the chamber soon after the fighting starts and proceeds to disable the shields protecting the injectors. At later stages, he also deploys his Scorpio Turret and helps with the actual fighting. Lilith, against all advice, also teleports in to join the fight. Once the pair of them are fully engaged, the fighting becomes easier, although tougher enemies will appear during the closing stages of the fight. When Roland disables a shield, Vault Hunters should keep their distance from the injector before destroying it as the resulting liquid flow can slag them, though this does not affect Roland, Lilith, or enemies.",Borderlands_2

Marcus's Store Room brings an end to the failed attempt to recover the Vault Key, and also provides a number of lootable objects. There are several weapons chests and various ammo crates to restock from here. Upon returning to Sanctuary, Marcus himself will emerge from his fortified booth and lament the sudden appearance of any Vault Hunters exiting his store room.

Strategy[]
The preliminary targets are to get to the Arid Nexus bridge in Eridium Blight and then proceed to Sawtooth Cauldron. The bridge to Arid Nexus has been raised and Brick needs explosives to lower the bridge.
Arriving at the place, Vault Hunters need to reach The Buzzard Nest at the top of Inferno Tower to neutralize the defending buzzards and prime the Odomo crates for pick up. Along the way are various location objectives and a lot of hostile bandits.
Jump down, go into the ""Smoking Guanno Grotto"" and follow across the cave to the lift. Once reaching the elevator's base and trying to call it down, the Sawtooth leader, Mortar, keeps the elevator locked and summons an ambush on the Vault Hunters. This attack is fronted by four Ambush Commanders (who are Nomad Taskmasters) spawning at both sides of the elevator and attacking at once, making this a particularly intense fight.
The second objective entails passing through a reservoir and Cramfist's Foundry. This means passing through areas teeming with hostile bandits, but also a lake area populated by several threshers. The usual base units of tadpole threshers are present, but encounters may well include a wormhole thresher and sometimes a badass Pyre Thresher.
The ultimate goal is for Boombringer, Mortar's buzzard. While destroying the buzzard is a simple task, the path to reach it is protected by two automated Gatling turrets, several buzzards and a number of bandit units. An optional objective, prompted by Brick over the ECHO, is to turn away from the Boombringer's explosion to ""look badass"" and to scare Mortar.
""Cool guys don't look at explosions.""
Upon returning to the Foundry, Mortar descends in the elevator to exact retribution. The area should be clear by this point, and without backup, he is only a slightly tougher bandit with a powerful gun and some explosives. Killing him is optional.
The elevator leads to the top of Inferno Tower, which is an open deck with minimal cover. More bandits appear and are reinforced by five buzzards. Once the bandits and buzzards have been cleared, the four Odomo crates can be tagged for pick up by four Slab Support Buzzards. Brick will then tell the fastest and most badass way possible to get back to the fast travel station: jumping off the tower.
After Brick's buzzards bombard the bridge to lower it, the mission is turned in at the Arid Nexus - Boneyard Catch-A-Ride.

The objective is to reach the Hyperion Info Stockade through the Eridium pipeline, but on approaching it the ladder breaks down, denying entry to the pipe. Mordecai suggests visiting a nearby Eridium pumping station, which is guarded by a few loaders and Hyperion personnel. Once the initial resistance has been overcome, more loaders are sent by moonshot when Vault Hunters approach the inner perimeter. After they are dealt with, the two valves can be turned on to raise the pressure of the pipe. Mordecai ECHOs again about visiting two more Eridium pumping stations nearby and following the same procedure, each protected by the usual Hyperion loaders and personnel. Once the valves in all three pumping stations are turned on, Vault Hunters can crash any vehicle with the pipeline at the spot of the ladder to make a big hole through which one can reach the upper deck and gain access to the Badlands.
The Hyperion Info Stockade is built above Fyrestone but requires an elevator to ascend to the overpass which is located near the bus stop, and the path there is guarded by multiple JNK Loaders. On approaching the bus station, Saturn is sent by a moonshot from the Hyperion moonbase, and guards the elevator. Saturn has several devastating attacks, including dive-bombing surveyors, homing missiles, and an electric cannon barrage. Although defeating it is not a requirement, Saturn will still pose a significant threat if left alive. Halfway into the overpass, more loaders are sent by moonshots followed by a Badass constructor.
Once inside, a few EXP Loaders will try to stop intruders taking advantage of the uneven stair structure. At the upper floor is the panel which stores the whereabouts of the Vault as well as Lilith. On interaction, two more constructors are sent on each of the extended platform which can be destroyed with ease due to the cover provided by the building. Once the information is obtained, Mordecai reveals the Vault's location in Hero's Pass.

Before going to the final fight, talk to the characters around the Sanctuary. Each of the key NPCs completes its monologue with the donation of an item; Tannis gives a relic, Zed a shield, Scooter a Grenade Mod, Hammerlock a Sniper Rifle, Moxxi a Submachine Gun, and Marcus an Assault Rifle. Most of these will be blue rarity, although other rarities (especially purple) are also possible[1]. Each of the mission objectives to talk to them will be checked off the list when the item is taken. The Vault Hunters must then travel to the Eridium Blight to meet Claptrap and defend him while he opens the gate to Hero's Pass.
In Hero's Pass, the Vault Hunters must fight through a multitude of Hyperion robots and personnel to reach the Vault of the Warrior. Mordecai and Brick assist until their drop barge is shot down by JET Loaders.
The final confrontation takes place between the Vault Hunters, Jack, and The Warrior. Jack is armed with dual wrist launchers that fire energy bolts and sustained incendiary beams. He begins the battle utilizing a cloaking device, while continuously spawning weak holographic decoys that triggers kill skills and second winds. Once his non-regenerating shield is depleted, Jack becomes vulnerable to incendiary damage and will call in Hyperion Loader reinforcements and switch his combat style to deploying turrets and corrosive grenades while calling in personal shield surveyors to protect him (which has stats similar to a Badass Surveyor, but cannot attack). He will also occasionally use an extended area of effect special attack in which he bombards the area around him with mortar-like energy blasts, or sweeps the area in a 360-degree angle with his energy beams (these attacks often have the effect of destroying his reinforcements, including his own shield surveyors). Jack's durability is above average (with a shield almost 2-3x tougher than a boss of a similar level and three times the health of a badass psycho). Shots to his head will yield critical hits. Jack may also sometimes run to a console and use it, which provides an opportunity to deal extra damage. After Jack is defeated, he will force the Vault Key into a fitted slot below and summon The Warrior.
The Warrior uses fire and its tail to attack from one of three positions; it can also walk across the stage to inflict major damage from stepping on Vault Hunters, before diving into the lava and launching them into the air with its tail. Upon emerging from the lava, the Warrior will occasionally climb one of the massive statues, rip a chunk of rock from it, and throw it as a weapon. Most of the Warrior's attacks can be avoided by taking cover behind rocks and statues. The central island provides several excellent places to do this, with two rocks to the north of the console providing overhead cover which can also prevent characters from being knocked into the air. The first ammo console will block most of the Warrior's attacks, as well as those from volcanic crystalisks, except for the fire breath by the Warrior when emerging from the side. The ammo console on the right is also a viable choice, as the Warrior's attacks barely even reach there.
The Warrior takes reduced damage from attacks hitting it anywhere but the four volcanic scales on its chest, and a critical hit spot in its mouth. The Warrior is resistant to incendiary, explosive, and slag damage. The scales can be broken for a second wind and to reveal a critical hit spot, but will regenerate when the Warrior dives into the lava.
The Warrior dives down into the lava at various times during the battle, offering around 3 seconds when characters can reposition, or restock with ammunition. This happens randomly or if it takes a large amount of damage in a short period. If the Warrior dives into the lava head-first then it will use its tail to hit the central area three times, which can knock characters high into the air with the risk of landing in the lava. If The Warrior enters the lava tail first by backing in, the lava rises faster but this is the best time to go for more ammo. The Warrior is a large target, so it's usually not hard to reacquire when it resurfaces, but checking the red blips on the radar can also help to narrow down the options on where to look if the Warrior resurfaces completely off-screen.
Four to five volcanic rakks fly around the central platform, providing an easy source of second winds. Additionally, a volcanic crystalisk spawns whenever the Warrior dives into or emerges from the lava. It is best to kill the crystalisks promptly, as their explosive crystal bombs can easily launch an unfortunate Vault Hunter into the lava. These enemies will be hostile to the nearby loaders, should they remain alive when the Warrior is summoned.
Once the Warrior is destroyed, the Vault Hunters may endure an angry speech from a dying Jack about the impossibility of his defeat, then killed him with no mercy. His diatribe can be cut short with a gun or melee attack, or have Lilith deal an energy blast.

The mission begins with Zombie T.K. Baha instructing players to defeat the Pumpkin Kingpin, who is harassing the inhabitants of Hallowed Hollow. Upon making their way to the gate leading to his lair however, the gate slams shut and a magical lock prevents the Vault Hunters from passing. T.K. Baha then asks them to round up three pieces of the skeleton key, which can be used to unlock the gate. The pieces can be collected by finding and killing three enchanted skeletons hidden in graves throughout Necropolis, the Church of the Dead, and Lavashore Village. Enchanted skeletons have slightly more health than normal reanimated marauders and attack with multiple magical spells, most of which deal only minor damage.
Once the three enchanted skeleton bones have been collected, T.K. Baha tells of a friendly blacksmith who will forge the key. West through Lavashore Village and The Colony is a long valley swarming with spiderants, followed by the Infested Forge. It is here that Sully the Blacksmith makes his appearance, but as an enemy rather than an ally, and has high health, fire resistance, and a very powerful hammer throw attack. Once the hammer is collected from Sully's body, the enchanted bones must be placed on the anvil, where the hammer is then used to forge the key.
With the key assembled, the next phase is to return to Necropolis to unlock the gate and face the Pumpkin Kingpin. Upon exiting the Infested Forge there will be a red chest to the right of the door. After Vault Hunters reach the Pumpkin Kingpin's lair, T.K. Baha remembers that the Pumpkin Kingpin is slumbering underground, and will need to be lured out by flooding the Pumpkin Patch with blood. However, the windmill that runs the pipeline is not working, and Vault Hunters must shoot six skrakk nests to unblock the blades, all the while being assaulted by swarms of skrakk. A valve is then activated to release the blood and flood the Pumpkin Patch.
With the Pumpkin Patch awash with blood, Pumpkin Kingpin claws his way out of the ground. He has several different attack methods: 1. Short range melee attack which can be avoided by keeping distance or dodged by running backwards quickly. 2. Sometimes he sprints a short distance to run into the Vault Hunters. 3. He throws pumpkins which stuns the Vault Hunters on impact or explods after being on the ground for a while.  4. He also has a power attack which he need to charges before attacking. While he's charging the power attack there is a large circle on the ground which shows the influenced field. 5. An energy beam or a flame beam. 6. Homing fire balls. Besides that, he can also summon minions from time to time. The minions can attack the Vault Hunters as well as heal Pumpkin Kingpin after they climb on his shoulders. If there are several minions on his shoulders Pumpkin Kingpin could be healed very fast so it'd be better to deal with the minions on his shoulder first. When he's defeated, Pumpkin Kingpin's head pops up and begins to bombard Vault Hunters with powerful blasts of fire while flying around rather slowly. His head is much weaker than his body and can be killed easily. Upon his defeat, the Pumpkin Kingpin will drop a custom head for a random character along with average loot and an unusually high number of vehicle skins.

In the snowy mountains overlooking the town of Gingerton, Marcus is in a grinchy mood. The townsfolk bought a big shipment of guns from him so that they can pass them around as Mercenary Day gifts, and if there's one thing Marcus can't stand, it's charity. That said, the train carrying the guns hasn't arrived yet, so Marcus wants the Vault Hunters to check it out. Follow the mountain path and shoot out the Bullymong-like Yetis to reach the gates.
Upon arrival, Marcus finds that all the citizens are frozen. As much as Marcus wants to revel in not having to hear any Mercenary Day carols, he can't make money from frozen customers. Head up the path to the furnace and check it, then follow the trail of coal to a group of seemingly-innocent snowmen. Nothing innocent about them at all, however, as they are the minions of Mister Tinder Snowflake and they are out for blood.
Further along the path, bandits are lurking around, and a bunch of them are looting the train of its cargo. Kill them all, then use a fire weapon to melt the ice on the gears and lower the bridge. Pull the lever to signal Conductor Rankin to start the train. A snowman ambush occurs after the bridge, followed by a bandit attack. Once the train is at the station, pull the lever to feed some coal into the furnace and hit the switch to light up Gingerton. Smaller-than-average Timothy thanks the Vault Hunter for saving him and Mercenary Day.
The last task is to reduce Mister Snowflake to slush. Head to the frozen lake in the northeast corner of Gingerton and ring the bells to wake Snowflake up. The snow-made miser has multiple attacks with a wide range, such as throwing giant snowballs, throwing a wreath-lasso, throwing giant breakable candy canes that remain stuck in the ground or using his icy breath to briefly ruin gun stability. He will also summon other snowmen to aid himself, but they are handy for Second Winds. Tinder Snowflake is weak against incendiary damage, but resistant to corrosive and slag while being immune to slag himself, with his hat and head being critical hit locations. Once Snowflake is defeated, pull off his hat to finish him off. When the Vault Hunter returns to the town, the gun shipment is delivered in two chests on the side of a train and contains loot and Eridium.

Strategy[]
Mad Moxxi and Innuendobot 5000 explain the objective at Innuendobot's Rectory. Moxxi wants the Vault Hunters' help in bringing a truce between the warring Zaford and Hodunk clans by marrying a pair of goliaths (one from each clan), though Ellie chimes in from the ECHO saying that it will be a bad idea since two united clans will only kill them faster.
Moxxi decides to spice up the romance by mixing up a love potion, but she needs ""something new, something old, something borrowed, something gold"". Ellie marks the location of something that will cover half the things on the list.
Near the couple, there is also a white-colored fish in a bucket next to a fishing pole. Taking the fish and using it with the fishing pole will pull up a large Feeler Thresher named Sigmand. This is part of an optional mini-mission to fish for five unique threshers and mount their hides to open a red treasure chest (which is just across the bridge).
Ellie's waypoint goes into Moedown Motel, where the Hodunk clan is guarding the couple's baby, a Midget Goliath. The clan turns hostile once the baby is ""borrowed"". There is also green thresher bait in a bucket next to the baby's van, which is used to fish for a Thresher named Ikaroa.
Moxxi now needs something old, and some aged whiskey from the Zafords' The front gate is locked and a JNK Loader named Ed yearns outside for his lover Stella. Talking to Ed encourages him to bust open the gate. The Zafords will not be pleased and will attack until Ed reaches a crack in the wall and busts it open. Samples are then sipped from the caskets to locate the one that Moxxi needs.
Ed opens up a door heading deeper into the distillery, where a pot of gold sits. After following the left and heading upstairs past an Ammo Dump machine, there is a large fuel tank where blue thresher bait (to catch the thresher Moby) is hidden. As soon as the pot of gold is approached, it turns into a BLNG Loader and runs off into the distillery. It must be destroyed to drop its head and the purple bait (for catching Fire Crak'n).
The collected ingredients are then taken to the mixer, and once the love potion is mixed, the baby is left with Moxxi at the Rectory. After a trip to Love's Lookout, the goliaths are found still arguing, but once they take a sip of the love potion, their moods improve and they take off their helmets to kiss before attacking everybody in sight.
Like all goliaths, the Happy Couple will keep getting stronger as they kill more enemies, so they must be killed quickly. When one of the newlyweds is killed, the other will run up and revive them, and then they will both upgrade, so they must be killed within a very short time frame of one another or the fight will never end, and becomes harder until they reach the GOD-liath stage. Once all is done, their dropped orange bait (to summon Rue, The Love Thresher) can be retrieved and the mission can be turned in.

Mordecai tells the vault hunters that they can use varkids to track Hammerlock with a syringe of his moonshine, so they will need to inject a varkid, which eventually dies from the alcohol.
Mordecai tells the vault hunters to repeat the same thing, but with less alcohol, but the varkid sobers up and the vault hunters need to kill it.
The next pod is a badass pod and the vault hunters will need to inject the alcohol into, which wears off from the badass varkid but it takes them near Hammerlock so they don't need to repeat the process again.
In the battle against the Son of Crawmerax, the fight will be in a waterfall-like area, the combat of the Son of Crawmerax is almost the same as Crawmerax's from the previous game, but it spawns crabworms and craboids and it mostly takes damage from its critical points.

Find a bullymong-riding-midget
Defeat Midgemong
Strategy
Midgemong is found in Southern Shelf - Bay at the top of the buildings along the shore. His location is marked by a $ sign as he is in a room with some vending machines. To reach the top, Vault Hunters must to traverse the length of the camp and ascend a ramp found on the far side.
The duo attack when a roller door opens, granting access to their room on the top level. They have separate health bars and critical hit spots, and are further backed up by two Badass Marauders that exit a door nearby.
Midgemong jumps to a predetermined series of locations whenever he is targeted. One way to kill Midgemong is to position a character adjacent to the doors of the room Midgemong originates from. From this location the Vault Hunter can target Midgemong at all the locations he jumps to but he will not jump to the Vault Hunter's position. As his gunfire is rather weak compared to his charge, defeating Midgemong from this location is comparatively easy, and possible even if the mission is tough. Vault Hunters can also purchase health kits and ammo from nearby vending machines at this location and it will not be necessary to clear the area of bandits on the way to him if this strategy is used.
Killing the midget first will result in the bullymong throwing debris and jumping around. Killing the bullymong first will cause the dismounted midget to shoot from a static location but otherwise move in the same manner as a Midget Goliath.

https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Assassinate_the_Assassins,Side,"""Roland suspects that four Hyperion assassins are hiding out in Southpaw Steam & Power. He's asked any Crimson Raiders in the area (that means you) to find the disguised assassins and kill them.""","Objectives[]

Pick up ECHO recorder
Kill Assassin Reeth
Assassinate Reeth with Melee (optional)
Pick up ECHO recorder
MDK Assassin Rouf
Assassinate Rouf with a Shotgun (optional)
Pick up ECHO recorder
Strategy[]
Once the mission is accepted, the next stop is in Southpaw Steam & Power. Each of the assassins is marked by an objective waypoint, but concealed behind a closed door until approached. In order for the assassin to show themselves, a number of nearby bandits must be killed, after which they emerge with even more minions. In some cases a door to the next assassin will be closed until the immediate one dies and drops an ECHO Recorder, only to automatically open when the recorder has been played.
The first target is Assassin Wot, a marauder. He appears in the company of a badass psycho. The psycho can be led away from Wot, and if he is led down into the pit, he will be trapped there and resort to throwing axes. Wot defends himself both by wearing a shield and by frequently hiding behind cover. He is also resistant to shock damage.
The second target is Assassin Oney, a nomad with a rectangular metal physical shield worn on his back. Oney poses a substantial threat in close to mid-range combat with his shotgun, grenades and four suicide psychos but the bonus objective of assassinating him with a sniper rifle can help to maintain the fight at a comfortable range. He also has a very devastating charge attack which will do significant damage but can be easily dodged. He will only use this attack when the Vault Hunters are sufficiently close without any obstacles in between. He is also resistant to explosive damage.
The third target is Assassin Reeth, a burning psycho that either throws or swings a flaming axe; both forms of attack are capable of dealing incendiary status effect damage. Reeth is accompanied by a Nomad Taskmaster and will not pursue the Vault Hunters if they leave his area.
The final target is Assassin Rouf, a fast-moving rat accompanied by a pair of nomad taskmasters. He quickly moves ahead of his men, but his quick movements can prove to be a hazardous distraction if chasing him leaves the slower duo to move closer unnoticed unless the nomads are taken out first. He attacks with a shotgun, and if the bonus objective is attempted this can become a tough fight with predominantly close range weapons on both sides, with the character being faced with a fleet-footed opponent.

The first objective is to search bullymong piles. These can be found marked by waypoints in Three Horns - Divide, and are opened either with the action key or with a melee strike. While in these areas, killing nearby bullymongs also counts toward a bonus objective of killing bullymongs.
Hammerlock will ECHO and call them ""primal beasts"", then requests killing one with a grenade. The game will change the bullymongs' names to ""primal beasts"". After killing a primal beast with a grenade, Hammerlock will ECHO again, saying he can't use ""primal beast"" because his publisher hates the name. He will then call them ""ferovores"", and requests that their projectiles be shot out of the air. The game will change the primal beasts' names accordingly.
When enough projectiles have been shot, Hammerlock will ECHO again, saying that ""ferovore"" is trademarked, and he then calls them ""bonerfarts"" before giving up and suggesting that some bonerfarts should be killed. After five bonerfarts are dead, Hammerlock will ECHO in a final time, saying that he can't use ""bonerfart"" either.

Shooting the shoplifter with a second weapon must be done after Marcus has finished his explanation and before the slag effect wears off. If the target is shot prematurely, the objective simply fails to update. If the slag effect wears off before the target is shot again, he will need to be re-slagged and shot again. On console versions of the game, it does not matter if the shoplifter is slagged as long as he was first hit with the slag pistol, and then a different gun.
The shoplifter can be killed, but Marcus will bring in another shoplifter if the character killed him without slagging him first.

After taking the injector from Sir Hammerlock in Sanctuary, the next step is to find varkids. Although the default location is Tundra Express, the mission can be continued in Caustic Caverns as well as the Natural Selection Annex. When a larval or blood varkid changes to adult pod, interact with it. Once the pod is injected, it creates a Mutated Badass Varkid instead of a regular adult varkid, which is a strong version of a varkid and can deal and resist corrosive damage. Sir Hammerlock remarks on how hideous the abomination is and requests that it then be killed. In order to study it further however, he then sets a task to repeat the process with four more varkids.
If these enemies prove too hard to take down, a good place to fight them is inside the Varkid Ranch Observatory, past the ""Caution"" signboard. It is best to disable the electric fence then take out all the bandits in there first, although this step might not be necessary. The Mutated Badass Varkids cannot get inside the tunnel, while their ranged attack is blocked most of the time and is easy to dodge otherwise. On rare occasions, they can get inside the Observatory by flying and clipping through the upper wall of the tunnel. This can be avoided by keeping distance when they are stuck at the tunnel entrance. Also, one problem that might occur is that the sample they drop might get stuck inside the tunnel wall if they are killed when clipping through the wall, making the item impossible to retrieve. This can be fixed by saving and reloading the game.

The mission is started by talking to Tannis, who speaks of a group of bandits who became mutated. The first step in the mission is to retrieve the pizza from Moxxi's Bar. Once obtained, the pizza is then taken to Bloodshot Stronghold. After two rooms is a room with two bridges and a short drop down into some water channels around the edges. One of these channels meets with a sewer tunnel leading away from the chamber, and this opens out into several rooms populated with Rats. The walk through the sewers ends at an intercom, which can be activated to get buzzed in. The pizza is then left on a table in the centre of a room, and once it is placed the Splinter Group will spawn.
The Splinter group will initially arrive one by one and will attempt to flee if hurt by approximately 50% of their maximum health. It is possible to kill the individual rats before they are able to leave. When Mick has been sufficiently weakened, all remaining rats will appear at the same time. Players attempting the Challenge Cut 'Em No Slack may wish to avoid dealing too much damage too quickly to avoid killing the group out of order.

The mission takes place at Mount Molehill Mine, where an ore extraction plant is being used to mine Eridium. There are various bandits in the area, including tunnel diggers that will disappear into the ground and resurface without warning. Ten miners need to be killed in order to complete the first objective, although there are more than just ten at the base of the mine.
Once ten miners have been dispatched, the next objective to kill Prospector Zeke arises. He can be found on a higher level accessed via a pair of conveyor belts in the middle of Mount Molehill Mine. The conveyor belts pass three rock crushers that can be dodged by waiting for each to rise or timing a sprint. The damage the crushers deal is not particularly heavy.
Prospector Zeke is a tough nomad, but the optional objective to kill him with Slag can make the fight easier. His shots are not especially powerful, but he also throws grenades, which are a more substantial threat. An escape by dropping back to the base of the mine area is a viable tactic as he does not follow. When killed, he drops an ECHO detailing his past association with Hyperion.

Find weapon cache
Clear ice: 0/3
Kill 10 midgets (optional)
Strategy[]
To get the mission, one must complete Bright Lights, Flying City first and then The Cold Shoulder before the Goliath appears near the exit toward The Highlands by the crystalisks. The Goliath may appear prior to leaving the zone to turn it in. Killing him without enraging and he'll drop the ECHO recorder needed to start this mission. It states that the location of a cache of weapons hidden somewhere in The Fridge. However, sometimes a One-Armed Bandit will spawn instead of the Goliath and killing him will not cause the ECHO recorder to drop.
The cache is inside the Crystal Claw Pit which is reached through the Rat Maze. Numerous rats fill the area presenting a hazard on the approach to the chest. To open it, one has to clear away the blocks of ice on top of it, turn in the mission, and only then would the chest becomes accessible. At this point, the mission ends, but Smash Head spawns and attempts to defeat the Vault Hunters. Smash Head carries multiple Midget Boners, a rocket launcher, and a large Dahl sign as a makeshift shield.
A good strategy against Smash Head is to open the chest and immediately back off to the center of the arena using the shipping container as cover. The container is tall enough to block all of Smash Head's rockets but allows the vault hunter to score easy headshots. Rocket Launchers are highly effective against him as the splash damage can ignore the shield and take out his midget boners as well.
It is possible for Smash-Head to spawn with an E-Tech launcher, including during the first playthrough, but he will not spawn with a Norfleet.

Ellie has a mission to pit the Hodunks and Zafords against each other. The idea is to pick up some explosives from her garage, and emblems from each clan from some derelict vehicles out the back, then use these to destroy an icon of each clan and frame the other.
The first is at the Hodunk Speedway, where the Zaford emblem is left behind as evidence to upset Jimbo Hodunk. The second is the distillery at Overlook, where the Hodunk emblem is left behind to draw the ire of the Zafords. There is little resistance to contend with - merely a few minor encounters near the speedway that are easily eliminated with vehicular weapons, or ignored altogether. Moving between the areas can be done via the zone connections, or by ignoring the objective markers at the connections and using the Fast Travel at Ellie's Garage instead.
Once the distillery is destroyed and their truce is broken, Mick Zaford puts out a call for all mercenaries to meet him in the nearby pub The Holy Spirits.

He is a Hodunk grunt with a shield and a shotgun, and will remain non-hostile until he is hurt. At that point he attacks, and can pose a minor threat to anyone on his platform with him, but is a vulnerable target to others.
The murder of the pyrotechnician becomes the trigger for the start of the race. Three Hodunk Racecars then circuit the course endlessly until they are destroyed. The objective is to trap and obliterate all with a well-timed blast, then finishing them off via other methods should any survive.

Strategy[]
The Hodunks send the Vault Hunters after the Zafords' cash stash hidden in Ale Wee Cavern. The objective is to follow Peter Zaford, the bagman, down into the cavern while remaining undetected. Shooting or getting too close in proximity to him will cause the mission to fail. Once the bagman has reached his destination, it's time to bag the bagman and snatch the cash.
The bagman is a midget armed with a corrosive Oberkil! shotgun. He also drops corrosive grenades and wears a version of the Pot O' Gold, a booster shield that drops money when damaged. He can teleport short distances and uses this tactic in conjunction with his corrosive grenades to leave a live grenade behind when he vanishes.
Whenever the bagman teleports to another spot, and often whenever shot, he drops a quantity of cash. After a few teleports and/or shots, however, he will cease to drop cash.
Phaselocking the Bagman before he notices offers a great advantage as he will be unable to teleport for the first few seconds, during which significant damage can be done to him easily.
There are ten ammunition crates in Ale Wee Cavern that are packed with money. Locating and opening all of these will complete the optional objective. The chests must be opened before the key is inserted into the final lock for the mission completion, or the supplementary objective will become unavailable.

Strategy[]
The Zafords and Hodunks all start out as targetable, but non-hostile. Vault Hunters side with either group by firing the first shot at the enemy they choose to eradicate, at which point the other group becomes allied.
On True Vault Hunter Mode and Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, Mick can be a fearsome opponent. He can make himself nearly invisible and deals extensive damage with his SMG, and while his Zaford Grunt minions can provide a Second Wind, they tend to flee for cover quickly. When fighting the Zafords it is best to eliminate Mick as soon as possible, and not allow his shield to recharge. Using Law and Order can be quite effective, as Mick's melee is slow and not too strong.
Tector & Jimbo operate as a single entity with Jimbo perched on Tector's shoulders. Tector fights with a shotgun, while Jimbo throws grenades. If Jimbo is killed, Tector becomes ""Grieving Tector"" and in this form is able to both lob grenades and use his shotgun.
The added firepower of a vehicle is very useful in this fight. However, it is very easy to lose the vehicle if it gets too close, especially when fighting the Zafords.

This is reached by two separate ladders, the first being at ground level on the tower building itself, and the second on the next building accessed by leaping across the gap between the two buildings. Once the power supply is in hand (despite complaints from a local man named Dave), it can be used to restore the local med vendor where the first of the skull-shivers medicine can be purchased.

The bodyguards are WAR Loaders, while the Requisition Officer is a tough version of an Engineer with a med vendor strapped to his back. He has a powerful shield to help protect him and will attempt to rush into melee range to attack.

The first ECHO is on a dinghy in Old Cranky's pond. Aside from some light skirmishing with a few loaders and stalkers to reach the pond, a Badass Pyre Thresher will spawn when the hut over the pond is approached. The hut can provide some cover when dealing with the thresher. The perimeter warning will be triggered some distance from the ECHO, but it is within reach and can be retrieved safely.
The second ECHO is located under Blake Bridge. There are stairs leading underneath to a precarious jump from one beam to another to reach an isolated room. While falling from the beam is not hazardous, there are threshers in the sand below. The ECHO also happens to be physically close to some lootable objects on the other side of the wall, so it may be sucked through the wall if ammo is collected by group pick up before any attempt is made to collect it directly.
The third  ECHO is in a room with an electrical fence located in Aggregate Acquisition. The fuse box for the fence is on the tower directly above the room and the room is reached by dropping down from the dirt path after a constructor is encountered.
The fourth ECHO is in a moonshot container located in Frothing Creek Mill. The stalker piles holding a side panel has to be broken for the ECHO to be accessed.

The general procedure with Animal Rights is to follow the waypoints and flip switches at each one. This releases captive creatures that turn on their captors, yet will not attack Vault Hunters. This leaves players free to assist or simply stand back and watch as the animals get to work.
The first objective is at the Preserve Dockyard where some needle stalkers are penned in some containers (map point #2). Once released, they quickly set upon their former handlers. One in particular, named Willy the Stalker, presents a more formidable attacker than his brethren, and otherwise they will quickly overpower the Engineers arrayed against them, before diving into the water when they are done.
The second objective is on the way to Specimen Maintenance where a control room switch opens three wall grates securing a number of alpha skags (map point #3). One of the skags is named Willy the Skag and is tougher than the others. Once they have chewed through the guards, they depart through a darkened doorway that closes behind them.
The final objective, near the Observation Wing (map point #6), is to release Stinger, a bad ass stalker that also has an appetite for Hyperion's game keepers. Stinger may take some time bringing down all the prey running around, but they also bunch on the stalker, presenting a convenient target for area effect attacks. Seeing as Stinger takes no damage from player actions, a grenade or two can help to speed the fight along.

After picking up the mission from the Opportunity Bounty Board, Claptrap says to go forth into the city and destroy all likenesses of Handsome Jack. A mission marker will then point to the closest statue. Shooting it a couple of times will reveal that the statues are actually bulletproof, so Claptrap then updates the plan with the objective to locate an inactive constructor.
The constructor, nicknamed the Overseer, can be found in an open garage within the Orbital Delivery Zone. Activating a panel on the side will cause it to activate, and head towards the first statue.
The remainder of the mission is spent guiding the Overseer through the city and protecting it while it uses its lasers to dismantle Jack's statues. There are four statues to be destroyed in total, and each statue will be guarded by more Hyperion forces.
If the Overseer's health drops below 50%, a transfusion grenade or Maya's Restoration skill can be used to heal it. If it is healed above 50%, the objective will remain completed even if the Overseer takes further damage.
Once all four have been destroyed, the Overseer will make its way to the western exit of Opportunity. Finally, Claptrap will issue an order to make the Overseer dance, which causes it to do so briefly before exploding. The mission can then be turned in to Claptrap.

Defend supply crate (failable)
Strategy[]
The objective of the mission is to protect a Hyperion Supply Crate from an assault by loaders. At the start of the mission, the Vault Hunter is given three beacons to position Slabs in preparation for the impending assault. It is worth noting that when the previously friendly goliaths get their helmets shot off, they will not only begin attacking friend and foe alike per their usual behavior, but they will attack and destroy the cargo that is meant to be protected. For this reason it is advisable to place the goliaths on the front lines, furthest away from the cargo. However, when the Badass Loaders arrive, they will land in the Slabs camp, not far from the crate. If the raging goliaths are around, they can knock back and stagger the loaders with their powerful melee attacks, providing extra time to the Vault Hunters.
Once the beacons are set, loaders will start their attack run. A bandit turret at Bloody Knuckle Point can be commandeered to help whittle away their ranks as they march in from No Man's Land. The turret is very fragile, however, and is usually destroyed instantly if it is used. Slabs will also pitch in, their buzzards providing air support while various ground units attack and slow the Hyperion advance.
Since the enemies are loaders, strong corrosive weapons will come in very handy throughout the fight, notably: the Bad Touch, the Lady Fist, the Hornet, the Sand Hawk, the Teapot, and corrosive rocket launchers. Area of effect and Bouncing Bettie corrosive grenade mods can be used to great effect on the bridge as well as other narrow sections that the loaders have to go through.
Once the loaders' attack has been routed, it's time to investigate the supply crate that they wanted so badly.

""The Hyperion corporation is offering you a unique gun if you kill the requisite number of bandits for them. Though you would be wise not to trust Hyperion, a reward is a reward, and a dead bandit is a dead bandit.""
Strategy[]
The objective of the mission is to fill the quota of bandit kills, 100 in total with bonuses achieved for every 25 of a given element type. The mission is complete once 100 are killed, and will forfeit any incomplete bonus objectives.
Some major areas in the game have a high concentration of bandits, and are ideal locations for completing the main objective. These include Bloodshot Stronghold, Southpaw Steam & Power, Lynchwood, Frostburn Canyon, and The Fridge.
All bandit deaths are recorded on the main counter. This includes any bandit killed by other enemy types and deaths from various other sources such as explosive barrels. Despite the optional objectives saying ""weapons"", the source of the damage does not matter. A bandit killed by a shock barrel will count as a shock kill, and so on.
Destroying Bandit Technicals or Buzzards must be avoided if the optional objectives are pursued. Destroying a vehicle will only credit the objective summary with one kill towards the appropriate optional objective if a qualifying weapon is used, but a total of up to four kills will be added to the main kill counter.
Bandits that get run over by the Lynchwood train count as explosive kills.  Since such kills are hard to avoid, it might be advisable to leave a few explosive kills at the end.
Alternatively, to complete this mission quickly, the Southern Shelf is ideal as the whole area contains almost enough bandits to get the 100 kills.
To complete all four optional objectives, there is an easy and reliable, albeit slightly long-winded way to accomplish this. The small bandit camp in Three Horns - Divide next to the Sanctuary Hole map connection will always have exactly five bandits. Aside from a Stinging Cactus some distance to the south, there are no other hazards that could pose a problem. As there are only five bandits, the camp has to be visited 20 times.
Also, a good idea when pursuing the optional objectives is to kill bandits with various element types at the same time so that the optional counters go up more or less at the same rate, instead of focusing on one single type until the corresponding objective is completed. This way there is less risk of accidentally killing a bandit with the wrong element.

Place the bomb cart, causing it to trundle off into the tunnel, and triggering a new objective in the north-west corner of the area.  Reach the detonator on a raised platform at the indicated location.  After arriving at the detonator, the train will come from the right, while the bomb cart rolls in from the left on a slightly lower track. The train will stop in the center of the track from a few seconds to load Eridium, then start moving again to the left.  When the bomb cart is under the train, hit the detonator to blow up the train and the track it is on.
Note that the final detonator is in the same area as Mad Dog is found for the Breaking the Bank mission.  This can allow the two missions to be progressed concurrently, but beware Mad Dog's knockback attacks while on the raised platform, as being punted into the chasm will most likely fail the mission.

Confront The Sheriff
Kill her with a pistol (optional)
...and do not shoot the deputy (optional)
Strategy[]
The Sheriff, Deputy Winger, and a handful of marshals can be found at the bend in the road halfway up Gunslinger's Corner. Some of them will be on the rooftops, creating an awkward dynamic to the fight. As with the rest of Lynchwood's inhabitants, all of these units are level scaled (to a maximum of 30 in Normal Mode).
The Sheriff is the only real objective, while the others provide interference. She has slightly more health than an equal-leveled Bruiser, and also possesses an almost equally tough shield. She comes armed with a pistol and tends to stick to the rooftops, but will jump down to street level to pursue if the action moves away from her, even chasing Vault Hunters down to the lowest part of Gunslinger's Corner if led that far.
Deputy Winger and the marshals are slow-moving and easily outrun. They do not seek cover, but are inherently tough, and those on rooftops are often in difficult targeting positions. Unlike the other Marshals, Deputy Winger is equipped with a shield and has more health.
Two bonus objectives make the fight even more awkward. Killing the Sheriff with a pistol limits the weapon options used to deliver the final shot, although other weapons can be employed in bringing her health down without nullifying the bonus objective. Avoiding shooting her deputy further pressures player choices towards precision armaments. Any damage from the character, such as grenade splash damage, will cause the objective to fail. Skills such as Cloud Kill, Helios, or Ruin tend to hinder Maya in achieving this objective. On the other hand, Axton's Sentry Turret and Gaige's Deathtrap can kill the Deputy without causing the objective to fail ().
To achieve the optional objectives more easily, one can run past the marshals before the fight starts and reach the upper platform of Gunslinger's Corner. After jumping over the trunk chest, the Sheriff can be shot (with a Dart so shots home in on the Sheriff) while the roof blocks the view of the marshals as well as the Deputy.

Question Lindy (optional)

Only one member of the group will speak the truth; the others are lying.
Their statements are:
Sam: O'Cantler stole the money
Lindy: Sam stole the money
O'Cantler: Sam is lying
Jim: I didn't steal the money
There are a few ways of deducing the thief.
Simple deduction:
If Sam is the thief, Sam is lying, and Jim, O'Cantler and Lindy are telling the truth.
If O'Cantler is the thief, O'Cantler and Lindy are lying, and Jim and Sam are telling the truth.
If Lindy is the thief, Lindy and Sam are lying, and Jim and O'Cantler are telling the truth.
If Jim is the thief, Jim, Sam and Lindy are lying, and O'Cantler is telling the truth.
Paradoxical relationships:
Both O'Cantler's and Jim's statements form a paradox if both are lying based on Sam's statement, so one must be telling the truth. Since there is only one truth-teller, Lindey and Sam are both lying. If Jim is lying, his statement only accuses himself, while both Sam's and O'Cantler's statements exonerate O'Cantler. Furthermore, if Jim is telling the truth, O'Cantler would have to be lying about Sam lying, again creating two truth-tellers.
Observation:
Each of the potential culprits is carrying something on their back. Jim is wearing a large backpack with a dollar sign on it. From this evidence, one may assume that Jim is the thief.
If Jim is shot, a fair amount of money will drop from his corpse. Shooting anyone else will cause Jim to reveal that he was the culprit and run away, though the mission reward will still be given.
Solution:
Jim is the thief

Find giant skag
Kill Dukino's Mom
Strategy[]
The mission begins at the Sanctuary Bounty Board with an ECHO recording of a bandit who has been murdered by Dukino's mother, and immediately leads to The Old Mine in Lynchwood. Heading back down the elevator into the mine where Dukino has found a new home, Vault Hunters will discover Dukino's Mom attempting to devour him.
Dukino's Mom has three main attacks: a leap that will generate a large shockwave, her laser beam, and electrical orbs flying in an arc pattern from her mouth. Her energy beam sweeps quickly and can switch to different targets instantly. Her mouth is an open critical hit location while she is charging up this attack. She can also destroy the rock columns that provide cover in the arena, making it more difficult to take time to heal or revive crippled characters. Her footsteps also disrupts shields from recharging.
At certain points in the fight, bandits will appear and attack her. These serve as a distraction for Dukino's Mom and as a potential source of easy kills for a Second Wind.
As Dukino's Mom is an armored skag, powerful corrosive weapons are extremely helpful in this fight. Failing this, explosive weapons or rocket launchers may have to be used, although some rockets will simply bounce off her hide.
Cover is limited in The Old Mine. While hiding behind the elevator switch is possible, the narrow profile leaves characters exposed to the arching shock attacks. The rock formations provide cover from the skag and the bandits, although Dukino's Mom can remove them from play by obliterating them with physical attacks.
The safest (though slowest) strategy is to trigger the elevator and immediately jump off, shooting down the shaft whenever Dukino's Mom comes within view. Only her electrical attack will damage a character from this position, and it can be more easily avoided or recovered from.

The swarm of skrakks (skag/rakk hybrids) can be found in Arid Nexus - Boneyard. It is a difficult fight as the monsters can fly like rakk, have the durability and damage output of skags, and tend to have a high level. Skrakk are hostile to Hyperion forces. They are vulnerable to incendiary damage, whilst being resistant to corrosive attacks, presenting an incentive to have both damage forms available on weapon switches in order to deal with the skrakk enemies and nearby loaders in the same battle. Using the Bandit Technical's catapult is another valid option.
Once 20 skrakks have been killed, the objective will change to ""Kill Zed's Abomination"". The abomination in question is Spycho, a fusion of a psycho and a spiderant, that can be found in Frostburn Canyon. It moves quickly and has a ground slam attack that is both damaging and knocks targets back. Spycho can also initiate a long pounce attack to quickly close distance to melee range. It has a critical hit location on its thorax.
Other units in Frostburn Canyon can provide further interference while fighting Spycho, although these have minimal threat value in Normal Mode due to their low levels compared to Spycho itself. Additionally, Spycho is hostile to the bandits, but allied with the spiderants, and so can be easily distracted by being lured to bandits.

The flags may be placed in any order but the generators used take some time to raise the flag and have to be defended from multiple waves of bandits. If the Vault Hunter dies or the generator takes too much damage, the generator has to be restarted, though the flag-raising progress is not affected. Once the Slab flag is fully raised, the generator must be destroyed.
The Sawtooth Stilts flag is at the back of the valley, requiring a fight through bandits in order to reach it. Once the generator is activated, the bandits attack in waves from all sides. The close proximity of the attack ensures that damage to the generator is highly likely.
The Scalding Remnants flag is in an exposed location well out in the Scalding Remnants. The area is only sparsely populated by bandits, but there are also some threshers that might attack if anyone strays into the water. The enemy waves consist of buzzards, which approach from the direction of the Buzzard Nest, and these will disgorge pairs of Marauders who proceed to attack from the ground. Cover here is limited, but there is a low fence that offers moderate protection from the marauders.
The Reservoir generator is beyond the reservoir, well away from the bandit's homes. Bandits will emerge from the street when the generator is activated, and buzzards may also attack from the Buzzard Nest. Most targets here will be at long range and approaching in the open, so long-range weapons are ideal for picking them off before they get close enough to damage the generator.

Find the lost treasure of Old Haven.
Collect clues: 0/4
Under the acid-soaked railway
In the warehouse on the shore
In the digger's shadow
Within Dahl's bloody sixth
Access top floor of facility
Find Treasure
Strategy[]
After finding the ECHO recording, players are given the objective of finding the four pieces of the map. The map pieces have a chance to be dropped after killing various bandits. Upon picking up a map piece, Brick will make contact, giving some back story on Old Haven and the treasure.
Once the map has been assembled, Brick announces that the next objective is in the Caustic Caverns. The clues point towards four switches. Excluding the acid-soaked railway objective, all switches can be found through normal traversing of the Caustic Caverns:
The switch under the acid soaked railway is on the middle support pylon holding up remnants of the old rail above the caustic lake.
The switch in the infested warehouse is on a wall actually outside the facility on the shore of the acid lake, facing a broken concrete slab with a green weapon chest.
The one in the digger's shadow can be found on the side of a transformer directly under the front of a bucket wheel excavator near the Guardian Ruins.
The last switch is on a wall in a corner of Dahl Deep Core 06.
Once four switches have been activated, ascension to the top of the facility is gained by way of an external service elevator between the Nether Hive and Rumbling Shore. The Varkid Ramparts above is an area predominantly populated with spiderants, plus the occasional varkid. An open area in the upper reaches of the Varkid Ramparts holds a hatch with a switch, and accessing this completes the mission.

Retrieve stolen Hyperion beacon
Place beacon for Ulysses
Pick up Ulysses' pet (optional)
Strategy[]
The Hyperion supply beacon is located under The Buzzard Nest, in Smoking Guano Grotto. From the bottom of the elevator, and continuing down the walkway towards Sawtooth Stilts, there is a hole in the floor with a ladder leading down. Descending at this point allows access to a pile of debris at the location of the supply beacon.
Alternatively, the beacon can be accessed by jumping off the east end of The Buzzard Nest, then north down into Sawtooth Stilts where there is a cave opening into Smoking Guano Grotto. The ladder to the supply beacon is just inside and to the left.
The optional objective is Frederick the Fish, and is located near the bottom of the elevator. It is placed up high on a shelf, and to reach it requires either climbing a nearby ladder, or jumping on some boxes.

Find radio station
Silence Hunter Hellquist
Strategy[]
This Just In takes place at Hunter Hellquist's elevated broadcasting station, a small structure located just a few dozen meters from the Boneyard's fast travel station (see mark #2 on map). To reach him one must first access an elevator platform on the ground, and then open one of two doors at either end of his booth.
Hellquist is a badass-level opponent with a matching energy shield. He is equipped with a submachine gun, and can also use the boombox-like apparatus on his back to launch an explosive energy mortar. Additionally, robot reinforcements will descend to help him out. Shock damage is a valuable asset to assist with depleting his shield, and corrosive is effective against any accompanying loaders. Rakk can also be found circling near the broadcast station, and may intervene in the fight.

Mail blueprints to Hyperion
Strategy[]
Upon reaching T.K. Baha's House, Una will make contact and say to look for a switch to get into her uncle's old lab. The chain on the ceiling fan inside the house opens a trap door leading down to the basement.
The evidence Una wants is stashed in one of the boxes. Opening all of them uncovers a series of ECHO logs chronicling T.K.'s story - how he came to Pandora, and his involvement with Hyperion. The last log is a message from Mr. Blake claiming Hyperion ownership of his weapon designs, and suggesting that he and his wife leave their home planet before Hyperion assassins reach them. Una will state that it's the evidence she needs and that she'll offer the first gun T.K. gave her.
Pulling the switch on the left side of the vending machine reveals the blueprints for T.K's Wave. Upon claiming them, a Hyperion representative will make contact, countering Una's offer with a Hyperion offer. Mailing the blueprints to Hyperion via the mailbox by the Boneyard connection awards the Tidal Wave for the mission, while mailing the blueprints to Una at the bounty board awards the Lady Fist.

Strategy[]
First candy is located in a vehicle submerged in lava just before the entrance to The Pumpkin Patch. There is a path leading down to the vehicle.
Second candy can be found in a nest sitting atop one of the pipes drenching The Pumpkin Patch with blood. Walking down the partially collapsed wooden walkway connecting two parts of the Hallowed Hollow Farms, a large reservoir can be seen to the right just before the walkway ends. Dropping down onto the reservoir and following the pipe going out of it, will lead to the nest with candy.
Behind Church of the Dead, there is a tree where a skeleton with a candy is hanging on a rope. Candy can be acquired either by jumping and meleeing the skeleton or simply shooting at it until candy falls down on the ground.
On the western side of a wooden platform and just before the collapsed bridge in The Lava Bluff, there are ladders leading down to some houses precariously hanging over the lava river. Candy can be found on a porch of the last house.
Running through the collapsed bridge from The Lava Bluff side and jumping on top of the bridge on the other side leads to the last candy.

Innuendobot 5000 has apparently watched too many romantic comedy vids on the ECHOnet, and now he wants to know true love. For his first request, he asks that some cigars be taken from the Hodunk bridesmaids located near Moedown Motel. He then asks for a blonde wig, which can be taken from the head of Stella the loader near the distillery. She and her lover Ed won't be happy, so they will both have to be destroyed. The final item to collect is some grease, which is found inside the distillery on the path to the pot of gold's former location.
The items are then returned to Innuendobot just outside the distillery, so that he can make gift bundles from them. The blonde wig is then taken to Lilah Ann Hodunk, but she does not respond nicely to Innuendobot's come-on. The cigars are taken to Innuendobot's second suitor, Nathaniel Lynn Zaford, who also declines. The final gift is taken to Moxxi, who responds by requesting that Innuendobot be killed, despite his attempt to sweet-talk his way out of it.

As Sir Hammerlock prepares to give the Vault Hunters a new task following the death of The Invincible Son of Crawmerax the Invincible, an ECHO from Sparky Flynt (the son of Captain Flynt) cuts in and demands that the Vault Hunters face the members of his assassination and support group, Victims of Vault Hunters. All the members seek vengeance against the Vault Hunters for various personal incidents. Follow Hammerlock out of the arena.
The first assassin is Sergeant Jarter, who served with Axton in the Dahl army until Axton deserted his post. There is a small canyon in the northern section of Privilege Pavilion to the left of the bridge leading to the arena. The Vault Hunters need to investigate the wall at the end of the canyon to find a bomb, which blows up the wall and reveals Jarter. After investigating the remains, it turns out that Jarter was blown up with the remote bomb.
The second assassin is Grill Holloway, uncle of Marcie Holloway (Gaige's school rival whom Deathtrap accidentally killed). He hides behind a door to the east in the Sanctun of the Sacred Insect that only moves when a Witch Doctor's mask is placed before a totem altar. Simply search the nearby huts for a Witch Doctor and kill him, then take his dropped mask and place it on the altar. Inside lies the splattered corpse of Grill, whose transport apparently malfunctioned, causing him to fall to his death.
Cross through the underwater tunnel back to Wam Bam Resort to meet the third assassin Mordo Sophis, who seeks revenge on Maya for her murdering of his son, Brother Stephen Sophis, on Athenas. Climb the resort and enter the waterwheel area, then immediately turn left to find a switch that turns on a steam piston. Use this piston to reach a ladder leading to a patio where Mordo sits motionless. Someone poisoned his beer, saving the Vault Hunters the trouble yet again.
Proceed to the southernmost part of the island where the Retirement Cottages are. Sparky now introduces Blendo, the last surviving bandit of the Chung clan that Salvador single-handedly wiped out. Go to the cottage at the southernmost point and open the door to see Blendo's corpse hanging from a tree.
At this point, Sparky's hopes for victory have been dashed, but he reluctantly introduces Clements, a Hyperion scientist who wants Krieg. Simply follow the map to a glowing door and enter to see Clements impaled with needles. After Sparky rants about the death of his assassins and introduces Zer0's assassin, search the house for a switch and activate it to open a passage where Zer0's assassin lies impaled on poles.
Sparky is now fed up with all the incompetence and demands that he fight you himself. Follow the passage until you reach Sparky Flynt's Clubhouse, where he will immediately attack. Outside of high health, he packs little punch and will quickly die to concentrated fire. Once defeated, Hammerlock will call to tell you that ECHO messages have been sent to each of the Vault Hunters. Simply meet Hammerlock at the place where you first found him on Wam Bam Island to turn in and receive your message.

If his opponent is some distance away, he may perform a ground pound, splitting the ground open and sending a fissure toward them. This attack deals moderate damage as well as some knockback. It can be dodged by jumping over or to the side.
If an opponent is nearby, he may perform a spinning attack that deals moderate damage and knockback. This attack has a short wind up and can be avoided by moving out of the way.

Captain Traunt has one bar of non-regenerating shields and one bar of health. During his first phase (when his shields are above half) he uses cryo attacks, creating ice walls and cryo pools as well as launching large cryo orbs that will travel around the perimeter of the arena. When his shields are below half, he will switch to incendiary, creating pools of lava and launching incendiary orbs. When his shield is depleted, he will alternate between both elements.
Like any Maliwan Heavy, Captain Traunt's critical hit location is the large pack on his back, and well-aimed shots with a shotgun or sniper rifle can quickly kill him.

The Maliwan forces are not too much different from previous missions. Prolific use of shock and incendiary weapons can help to wear them down, with corrosive ones used on the Nullhounds and non-elementals for Elemental Heavies (specifically incendiary and shock varieties).
Contrary to most bosses, Katagawa isn't too durable, with a very weak shield and above average health. Finding him among a number of his clones would occupy most of the fight, as the sheer number drastically reduces the chances of finding the real one. One should take note that Katagawa's clones are incapable of deploying smoke screens. Avoid shooting the targets as the water may create shock elemental pools and deplete shields, while Katagawa rarely even wanders into them. Cover is sparse, so Vault Hunters should keep on the move to minimize the chances of these clones hitting them. If Katagawa does appear alone after his clones vanish, quickly inflict some burst damage. After losing most of his health, Katagawa would usually spawn near the entry point of the arena and will no longer spawn clones, allowing him to be easily finished off, though beware of his dangerous katana, as he can inflict extreme damage at close range.
When Katagawa is killed, simply find Rhys and Zer0 to reclaim the Vault key fragment.

Vault Hunters are instructed to progress to Neon Arterial, where a Maliwan squad will be blocking the way along with an energy Barrier. Rhys will inform them that he sent Zer0 and some Atlas infantry in an allied Technical. The enemies are fairly generic (Flash Troopers and Assault Troopers) although one heavy may spawn. After they are all defeated, Zer0 will destroy the energy barrier, allowing them to proceed. The Atlas reinforcements will no longer follow after this point.
The next part of the mission involves driving Ellie's provided vehicle (Project DD) to clear out bandits and enemy vehicles. This specific technical has the flak cannon front weapon and a unique paint job. Maya will occasionally launch energy blasts, which can instantly defeat most enemies. The COV will have rocket turrets and these can be dispatched with the technical's catapult as Maya will struggle to defeat these. There are minor checkpoints where Vault Hunters need to park their vehicle right on it, and Maya will destroy the obstruction with another energy blast.
Apollyon Station's enemies initially consist of nothing but COV units such as Enforcers, Psychos and Tinks. However, as Vault Hunters progress, Guardians will appear in the older parts of the facility. Guardians are purely energy-based foes and are weak to shock damage. If a shock weapon is unusable, non-elemental weapons can still be used. Some guardians may come with armor, which is easily dissolved with corrosive weapons. They do not be defeated for progressing to The Forgotten Basilica.
After entering the Vault and inserting the key, The Rampager appears as the mission's boss.
The Rampager is capable of the following attacks:
Claw Attacks - Attacks with its paws.
Bolt Spew - Spits out up to five slow projectiles.
Pounce Blast - Jumps and produces heavy blast on impact.
Nova - Produces a circle of projectiles.
Volley - Produces a volley of projectiles from its arms.
Seismic beam - Shoots a white beam out of its mouth at the ceiling while spewing a series of projectiles. The beam causes a rockfall around the point of impact.
Rock Throw - Smashes a piece of the arena (usually a pillar) and throws the detached piece at its target.
Ground Pound (Phase 1 only) - Slams the ground repeatedly releasing volleys of projectiles.
Barrage (Phase 3 only) - Pounces throughout the whole arena, launching a volley of projectiles.
The volleys of projectiles may be slid under or jumped over, depending on the player position during attacks. The most reliable strategy however is to be on a different level as they all aim at the center of the Vault Hunter model and are not homing.
The fight with The Rampager is divided into three phases and it is imbued with an element for each phase:
Phase 1 - Chest open, Irradiated.
Phase 2 - Second head, Corrosive.
Phase 3 - Wings, Incendiary.
Whenever it becomes imbued with a specific element, it becomes resistant to it, similar to most elemental enemies. The Rampager is also a flesh target, so incendiary weapons are powerful for the first two phases while non-elemental ones function best in the third.
The Rampager's critical spot is its chest opening and it is exposed when a seismic beam is fired. When sufficient damage has been dealt, the Rampager will briefly collapse and damage can be unleashed onto it. After several seconds, it will stand up again.
During the fight, Maya may revive crippled Vault Hunters. Floating on both sides of the arena are glowing wisps which can be destroyed with a single shot for an easy Second Wind. Eridian Guardians will also spawn (most commonly in the third phase), dropping health and ammo when killed.
When The Rampager is defeated, it drops loot, which can then be collected. The Vault ahead provides more loot though the most important item, the Eridian Resonator, must not be missed - With it in the Vault Hunter's arsenal, they can now shatter Eridium piles scattered across the game. Four chests will be available (two covered in Eridium), as well as many scattered eridium clusters. With everything collected, Vault Hunters can then follow Tannis's prompts.
The rest of the mission is simple as all remaining objectives are interacting with other characters. When the optional objective of talking to Ava appears, Vault Hunters should accomplish it for an extra reward. The mission is finished when Sanctuary III sets a course for Eden-6.

Wainwright will contact the Vault Hunters as soon as the drop pod lands, and asks for them to meet at his place. The path to him is clogged with unshielded COV infantry of all types. After conversing with Wainwright, he asks them to head to The Anvil, where Hammerlock is being held.
The Anvil is a a heavily infested location flooded with high quantities COV units. Care must be taken at any given moment to avoid being suddenly taken down. When the metal gate is opened, Brick shows up and helps the Vault Hunters until after the ambush phase (1-2 Badass enemies will always spawn here), whereupon he leaves after all the enemies are defeated. Brick will instruct them to meet Tina, who asks them to venture though more infested areas and take bomb components before delivering it back to her. The assembled bomb, however, can't be planted, as Mordecai watches over the prison's entrance and warns them that all units in the area must be defeated. With that done, the bomb can be planted and detonated.
Warden, the mission's final boss, has the following attacks:
Melee: Leaps to a vault hunter, then attack with fists, similar to a goliath.
Shock Grenades: Fires a volley of shock projectiles which splashes the area upon impact, quickly depleting shields.
Warden initially carries armor, and after it's destroyed he becomes vulnerable to Incendiary damage. Note that sufficient armor depletion will result in him gaining invincibility for several seconds. After this short period ends, his attack patterns become significantly more aggressive.
When Warden is defeated, shoot the chain on Hammerlock's cage to free him. The mission ends from there.

Troy's health is entirely comprised of flesh, and so a strong incendiary weapon should be used. He will go through several different phases, between each of them, he will fly back to Tyreen to power up; during this time, he is immune to all damage.
His primary attack involves him slamming down his sword, creating rings of phaselock orbs as he does. These will radiate outward from the point of impact and can be jumped over or dodged between. As the fight progresses, he will summon tinks and rakks to assist him in the fight. Due to their weak attacks and small health pools, they are best used as a way to gain a Second Wind.
During his final phase, Troy will surround his sword with a large pillar of rock before slamming it down. During the charge-up for this attack, he stays still, so his head is exposed. Additionally, his attack will not track, so it can be dodged if one moves fast enough.

Tyreen the Destroyer can be a very easy fight if the right precautions are taken. It is recommended to have a shield with the Brimming buff (+5% health regeneration when shields are full) so that when Tyreen ducks under or around the arena, the Vault Hunters can have some effective form of health regeneration. She will start the fight by rearing her mangled body and some quick damage can be dealt, the most being with shotguns.
Tyreen has four forms of attack in the initial phase:
A single beam that can deal massive amounts of damage and quickly cripple characters.
Rows of eridium shards launched from the ground in 3 directions
These can be outrun or jumped over.
Multiple bombs launched around the arena.
When her first portion of health is gone, the arena will turn purple and she will be immune for some time. Characters must climb on her back (as instructed by Lilith) and damage the Eye of the Destroyer that rests on her head so that she becomes vulnerable again. The fastest way up is behind the monster, while the critical hit location is Tyreen's head. If the eye is shot and the character backpedals, they can stand on her head to deal more damage. Weapons with massive burst damage (Hellwalker, Mind-Killer, etc) or those that regenerate ammo (The Butcher, King's Call, Queen's Call, or Lucian's Call,) will be useful in depleting her health. The character will be knocked off Tyreen if they are still on her when she gets up.
Her next set of attacks include a massive rotation cylinder of lasers, a fireball that shoots out in several directions, and an incendiary laser blast that comes from 5 directions in a cone. When she hits the final portion of her health bar, she will fly up and shoot out 20 or so lasers in 2 cone patterns that will deal a massive amount of damage if it hit the character. When she lands to stop and recharge, the killing blow can be dealt.
A different strategy to fighting Tyreen is to stay at the entrance of the arena. The majority of her attacks cannot reach there, and the ones that can are slow and very easy to dodge.
When Tyreen is killed, the Vault can be looted.

Kill The Holy Dumptruck.
Shoot 'em in the ass (Optional)
Open the trap door.
Find red chest.
Strategy[]
There's a bounty poster outside Ellie's Catch-A-Ride shop offering a bounty for a bandit known as The Holy Dumptruck. The Holy Dumptruck can be found at the top of the bandit outpost indicated by the mission marker, and to reach him requires fighting through a number of Children of the Vault fanatics. He carries a shield that will block most attacks, but using melee attacks or grenades can overwhelm his guard and open him up to gunfire. Occasionally, he will bend over to taunt by ""mooning"" and at this point he can be shot in the rear for the bonus objective to be completed.
When the Holy Dumptruck has been eliminated, Ellie messages to point out a nearby trapdoor. This can be opened by shooting two targets, one on an overhead water pipe and another on a power supply unit to the left of the pipe. This causes water burst free and form a puddle that completes a circuit through an otherwise broken power cable. With the trapdoor open, the mission is completed, allowing access to the final room in the bandit enclave where a red chest can be found.

Although an Outrunner can not be driven into the camp, it can be placed on the road just a short distance away facing the camp entrance. From there, and using Outrunner's mounted weapons, it is possible to take down Under Taker with little to no danger.

As Killavolt is immune to shock damage, non-elemental or radiation weapons should be used to deplete his shield. If the Vault Hunter has a sufficiently damaging weapon, they can aim for his physical shield in his left hand; after sufficient damage has been dealt, Killavolt will drop to his knees and his head will be exposed. Once his shield has been broken, incendiary weapons should be utilized for maximum effect.
The majority of Killavolt's attacks also deal shock damage, so The Transformer wil greatly trivialize the battle.
After Killavolt receives sufficient damage, he will teleport out of the arena and 2 to 4 enemies will spawn, consisting of fanatics and psychos. Killing these enemies quickly is recommended as Killavolt will perform a charging attack and swing his shield when he isn't targeted.

Due to their placement, all required items can be collected without fighting any of the enemies. Following the objectives markers Vault Hunters can rush through groups of enemies before they are able to inflict any serious damage.
Private Beans is a Badass NOG and can be found in the Dido's Remorse cemetery where he is backed up by a large group of Maliwan soldiers. To avoid being surrounded, Vault Hunters should be constantly on the move. If in danger of being killed, they can retreat outside the cemetery to replenish shields and health.
A strong shock weapon helps to strip down Private Beans's shield. With no shield, he will start using bullet-deflecting energy shield and blasting powerful waves. Vault hunters can then use their action skills to distract and force him to expose his vulnerable rear.

The fast travel network can be used to quickly warp around the map.
A Cyclone can be driven across the bridge and all the way to the remote delivery point at The Lonely Pillar on the far east side of the map. Characters can begin the mission at Roland's Rest, immediately teleport to The Lonely Pillar, and then teleport back to spawn a new vehicle and complete the remaining deliveries.

Strategy[]
Mordecai has been training a young girl on Pandora to become a new Vault Hunter, and he wants the Vault Hunters to visit her on her birthday as special guests. He first asks that they pick some flowers for Grace's party. Waypoints should be followed to pick them up, then meet with Mordecai at The Lonely Pillar as he stands over Grace's grave with her father Hirschim.
After placing the flowers on the grave, Hirschim explains that Grace was killed by varkids, but he's determined to celebrate the party in her memory regardless and leads the Vault Hunters up to his home. First up is some birthday cake. Hirschim brags that Grace's best cake-eating record is 11 slices. There are twelve slices scattered around the area but only two have to be eaten to progress the mission. Eating all twelve slices will make Hirschim and Mordecai surprised at the Vault Hunters selfishness.
Hirschim then leads the Vault Hunters over to the grenade range where he has ring targets set up. The Vault Hunters get to throw grenades into the rings for points. Only five points have to be earned and breaking Grace's record of 50 points makes Hirschim even more upset.
Next is the shooting range. The Vault Hunters and Mordecai will compete to shoot as many Rakk as possible. A time limit is given for the challenge and Grace's record is 30.
After talking to Hirschim, he asks for the Vault Hunters to break the piñata.
Once the party's over, Hirschim will give the Vault Hunters Grace's gun, the Amazing Grace, as his way of keeping her memory alive. If the Vault Hunters broke all of Grace's records, he'll give the gun but will be colder in attitude.
Completion[]
Turn in: Hirschim
Notes[]
An ammo vending machine is placed next to the grenade range if breaking Grace's record is intended.
If Zane has invested into two action skills, he cannot throw grenades for the grenade range objective. This can be circumvented by the ""Manage Loadout"" option for skill trees to make grenades usable.",Borderlands_3

This mission primarily consists of exploration and listening to Angel's memories. After locating the entrance to the area, Tannis asks for a stuffed bear to be found. It is located on a couch on the left side of the room.
Next, Tannis asks for an old vending machine to be found. It is located behind a barred gate on the north side of the room. The switch to open it is next to the gate. After interacting with the vending machine, it will dispense random guns and play the next memory. After listening to Tannis, a power fuse next to the vending machine has to be collected.
The collected fuse has to be inserted into a fuse box on the second story. Follow the route from the vending machine to an area behind the main room. This will lead to the second floor. There will be varkids along the path that can be either fought or avoided. Once at the fuse box, insert the fuse and shoot the switches to reveal a Hyperion turret below.
After listening to the memory, the turret will attack the character and must be destroyed. Once the turret is dealt with, enter the turret's room and look at the ceiling. There will be a ladder with a wooden pallet blocking the top. Shoot it and proceed up the ladder. Interact with the Hyperion satellite and listen to the final memory. Afterwards, return to Roland's Rest and interact with the water purifier.

Strategy[]
Vault Hunters are tasked with entering an ECHOnet game through VR simulation, and must escort Lana and destroy portals. Along the way, Lana will be attacked by various prototype enemies which are very weak and can be destroyed with minimal difficulty. Should Lana take enough damage, she will be incapacitated and must be revived.
After speaking to Mickey Tricks, Vault Hunters will escort Lana through a ""Portal Hotspot"" to destroy three portals. En route to each portal, she will be blocked by a wall that forces them to purchase a ""Wingshoe upgrade"". Each of these are available for $1, but will allow the mission to proceed. Once Lana reaches a portal, it must be destroyed. Guardians also pose a threat to anyone passing through the area.
Once the first hotspot is cleared, Vault Hunters must proceed to the second hotspot a short distance away. They are then tasked with collecting 100 energy sources while also being presented with another 'upgrade'. Unlike the previous 'upgrades', these do not need to be purchased and can be collected manually. However, the 'upgrade' reduces the required energy sources to 10. Once collected, the fourth portal must be destroyed.
After proceeding to the fifth portal, Vault Hunters are confronted by ""Rak’nagob, Destroyer of Worlds"". Like the other ""in-game"" enemies, Rak’nagob presents no threat. However, he does posses a large health pool. Another 'upgrade' is offered that gives a substantial damage boost against Rak’nagob and it too can be ignored in order to kill Rak’nagob without it. Once he is dead, the final portal  must be destroyed to end the mission.

Once the energy trap is placed, guardians will continually spawn.  When killed, they will appear to ""glitch out"" momentarily before turning into a slow moving red orb that flies towards the trap.  This orb can be accidentally destroyed with direct or splash damage, and will only appear if the guardian was not killed with sufficiently strong damage to ""gib"" it, which is especially likely if the player is using weapons with high damage per shot, or if the player is overleveled for the mission.  If difficulty is encountered getting the red orbs to spawn, it is recommended to avoid splash damage, to avoid critical hits, and to use the lowest-damage weapon available to avoid ""gibbing"" the guardians.

About three days after reaching the requisite number of murders, you will receive a letter: A young street urchin presses a letter into your hand. As you attempt to question him, it becomes obvious that he is both deaf and mute. With a wave of frustration you send him on his way. or You feel a letter slip into your hand and hear the sound of footsteps scampering away. There is no other sign of the mysterious courier.

Poor bastard. You have shown you can kill with care and not just with a bared blade. You are now a full member of the Dark Brotherhood.

Return it to the agent in time to learn the location of Lysandus' Tomb.","...wishes to meet in secret... ...to ask you to retrieve a cursed item... ...from Castle Llugwych, stronghold of the Blades Another Mysterious Letter[edit] Once you have reached level 8, are not actively disliked by the Agents of the Underking, and have found the Wayrest Painting for Queen Akorithi, the following will soon occur: A young courier drily hands you a letter and then stalks off without saying a word. Check your inventory to find an interesting letter: Dear (player's name), Queen Akorithi of Sentinel spoke highly of you as a brave, able, and unprejudiced (player's race). Her actual words were 'a hero.' For some time, we have been looking for someone like that. I will not lie to you about our loyalties. We serve the Underking. If you are a believer in fairy tales and consider the Underking the ultimate force of evil, we apologize for misjudging you. Otherwise, we need your help. You can find me at (building) of (town) in Sentinel. I will wait one month. -- (Agent's name) Note: your quest log will not list the town where the Agent of the Underking resides; the town is only named in the initial letter. Since you must return to the agent later to complete the quest, be sure to remember the name of the town or keep the letter safe and easily accessible. The specified rendezvous point is always located in a town in the Kingdom of Sentinel. If you are in a far-flung region, be prepared to travel rapidly as your contact will only wait a month. Travel to the town and find the target building. The door may be locked, so have an Open spell handy if you do not want to pick the lock or force the door. Enter the building and speak with the agent, who will greet you: ""Good day, (player's first name). My name is (agent's name). I must admit that I am surprised to see you. Are you perhaps able to help the Underking in an endeavor against the Necromancers? We will reward you liberally for this service, and provide information you will probably not be able to find elsewhere."" Agree to help, and the agent will reply: ""You will. Hmm. Remarkable. The Necromancers have taken an item of ours, a (magical item) of some value. The value is of secondary concern. The true problem is that they cursed this item and gave it to the Blades. If you are unaware, the Blades were once the honor guard for Tiber Septim. Today they are loyal to the empire and Tiber's code, but not always to the current emperor. The Underking has reason to not wish harm upon the Blades. We want you to infiltrate Castle Llugwych in Ykalon and remove the (magical item). Please have this done in (time limit) days if you want your information and reward."" Ykalon is far to the north, so gather what you need and set off without much delay. Castle Llugwych is not far from the City of Ykalon if you want to rest or resupply before or during your exploration of the dungeon. When you are ready, head for the castle and enter it. Finding the Item[edit]   From the entrance, head west into the dining hall. Kill the enemies in this room and go through the west door. Go up the hallway and through the door to the west.   Head south up the hallway, turn west, and go through the door. Leave through the door on the west side of the room and continue west past the intersection in the next hallway. Keep following the hallway south until you reach the door at the end.   Leave the small room through the eastern door. Walk up the hallway and turn south at the intersection. Continue heading south until you see a door on your left.   From the door, either continue south and head east at the intersection or go through the room and exit through the door on the south side. Either way, continue on this hallway and through the door at the end.   Follow the new hallway to the end and go east through the door. Enter the first room on your right in this new hallway and leave through the south door. You will arrive at an inactive elevator platform. To unlock the elevator, head east from the shaft and pull lever 1 in the tiny room. This will unlock a door to another room, where you must pull lever 2. Go back to the elevator and ride it up.   After stepping off the elevator, turn east at the junction. There is a vampire ancient in the next hallway. If you do not have any means of resisting shock damage and paralysis, your only chance is to run past it. In the room beyond is a pedestal with the enchanted item on top. If you did not kill the vampire ancient, grab the item quickly and run out the way you came immediately. Otherwise, you can take your time gathering the other treasures in the room. Backtrack to the castle's entrance the same way you came in.  Answers (and More Questions)[edit] The castle's denizens won't make things easy for you  Return the item, and the Agent of the Underking will say: ""Well done, (player's first name). Let me cast this spell upon the (magical item) ... there. The (magical item) is now safe and yours to keep. Not even death can hide a true descendant of Tiber Septim from the Underking. King Lysandus did not die in the battle of Cryngaine. He was slain by treachery before it. The monument to him in Hammerfell [sic] is an empty tomb. His remains were secretly taken to an ancient tomb in Menevia, which I will now reveal to you. I do not know who betrayed Lysandus, nor why his spirit haunts the city of Daggerfall and not the battlefield of Cryngaine. I have kept my part of the bargain, and you have earned the gratitude of the Underking.""

You can enter freely between 10:00 and 18:00, but will have to pick the lock at any other time. Find your target within; there is a 25% chance each that this will be a burglar, a healer, or a rogue.

Meet the client and hand over the ivory.","The scene of the crime The Ivory in question, stashed in a closet The owner hired rogues to guard his property from thieves like you The shirtless goons with the big swords are the archers sent to kill you (they also carry bows) The client behind the heist  A Valuable Stash[edit] Speak to the quest giver, who says: ""(Player's first name), a simple game. An item in a house that needs lifting. Are you up for it?"" Accept[edit] The quest giver goes on: ""That's the spirit.  As I said, nothing complicated about this job.

You have two days to bring it to me, for a finder's fee of (random gold) gold."" Decline[edit] The quest giver answers: ""You'll go far in the Thieves Guild with that attitude. Sure you will."" The Heist[edit] Ask around town to locate the residence where the ivory is being stashed. Go there and gain entry. The door will be locked, so be prepared to pick the lock or cast an Open spell. Find the ivory inside and grab it; you will then receive a message: This looks like the piece of ivory (quest giver's name) sent you to steal. Needless to say, the ivory's owner does not want it stolen, and the guards will descend upon you soon after entering. You may flee or fight; if you choose to fight, hitting a guard elicits a taunting response: ""(Oath), you're a feisty one, aintcha? Better get outta here before I have to really hurt ya."" If you kill a guard, another screams: ""This (player's race) scum killed (guard's name)!"" Reward (or Pursuit)[edit] No matter how you escape, return to the guildhall and speak to the quest giver. What happens next depends on how you handled the burglary. If you bring the ivory to the quest giver without hurting or killing any of the guards, he will say: ""Excellent work, (player's first name). Just the way I like these jobs to go, no fuss, no muss. Here's the (random gold) gold, and congratulations on a job well done."" If this is the case the quest is over, having successfully been completed. However, if any of the guards were injured or killed, he will instead be angry: ""(Player's first name), what are you doing here? I don't know how you could botch such a simple job, but if you don't get yourself and that blasted ivory out of town, we're all going to end up in the slammer, or worse. I don't give a damn about your skin, but the Thieves Guild has a reputation to uphold, and we promised our client that item.  Get over to (second town). (Client's name) will meet you in (client's residence) there. Don't screw up again."" Head to the client's location. You will need to take care, as there will now be a large posse of archers tracking you down. They want the ivory back from you; if you did not kill any guards during the burglary, they will be willing to trade it for your life. Upon being hit, the first archer you attack will say: ""Don't move, or I'll cut you down where you stand!  Give us the ivory you stole from (residence) and I'll let you go."" Giving away the ivory will cause you to fail the quest, but the archers will let you escape, saying: ""You're smarter than you look.  Now run along before we decide to turn you over to the (first town) guard."" Refuse the offer and be met with: ""Then we're just going to have to take it off your dead body."" If you did kill at least one guard during the burglary, then the posse will be out for your head, no quarter given: ""We know how to deal with murdering scum like you. (Archer's name), just be careful not to get any blood on (ivory owner's name)'s ivory when you cut this (player's race)'s throat."" Delivery[edit] Assuming you haven't surrendered the ivory, flee or fight your way to the client's home. Enter and deliver the ivory, and listen to the client rant: ""Well, if it isn't (player's name), the Inept Catburglar?  At least you managed to get through with the item. Says something about your brawn, if not your brains. You didn't actually expect to still get paid, did you?"" As the client implied, you will get no reward. In fact, you will actually lose a small amount of reputation with one subgroup of the Thieves Guild. If you don't deliver the ivory, the quest counts as failure and you will lose two reputation with the Thieves Guild, which is pretty little compared to the fuss that has been made about this whole situation.

Surrender or face the consequences."" or ""I heard you were smuggling (weapon)s for the Thieves Guild. Give them to me and I will spare your life."" or ""We want those (weapon)s. Turn them over and we won't rough you up too bad."" If you surrender the weapon, you are told: ""Now get out of here before you get hurt."" Naturally, if you hand it over you will fail the quest. If you refuse the offer, escape or fight your way to your destination. Find the correct building, enter and speak to your contact, who greets you by saying: ""Well done, (player's first name). I couldn't have made it here as easily carrying that (weapon). Here's a sample of what I've stolen so far ... a (gem). Bring it back to (quest giver's name) and let (him/her) know I'm fine.

Decline[edit] The Guildmagister answers: ""Oh, too bad. Now, where was I? Mmm, the azimuthal vectors, right. Let's see..."" The Arcane Artifact[edit] This quest is primarily a series of dungeon crawls. Depending on your choices, you may end up exploring as many as three separate dungeons, so plan accordingly. You do not yet know the location of the magical item in question, but you have two leads you can follow. Choose how you want to approach this quest: Path I: The Catalogue[edit] This note is all that is left of the Catalogue If you want to search for the catalogue, travel to the dungeon named by the Guildmagister and find it within. Once you have found it, pick it up and read it. The note will read one of two ways: Scenario 1[edit] In this scenario, the note will read as follows: Item No. 476-A-LCX-08  Type: (magical item) Creator: (item maker's name) of (item maker's town)  Description: This (magical item) is one of (item maker's name)'s lesser works, ranking below (his/her) famous Wand of Verbosity in craftsmanship, and not even close to a masterpiece of sheer audacity like (his/her) Scissors of Styling. Still, this (magical item) shows (item maker's name)'s distinctive style in the many small touches (he/she) puts on all (his/her) work: the embossed brass fittings with (his/her) signature stamp, the unusual choice of an enameled finish, and especially the mellow amber sparking along its exterior flow lines.  (on loan from (magical item's dungeon)) Head to the dungeon named in the note to continue your search. Scenario 2[edit] Other times, the note may read like this: Item No. 476-A-LCX-08  Type: (magical item) Creator: (item maker's name) of (item maker's town)  Description: This (magical item) is one of (item maker's name)'s lesser works, ranking below (his/her) famous Wand of Verbosity in craftsmanship, and not even close to a masterpiece of sheer audacity like (his/her) Scissors of Styling. In the years since (item maker's name)'s death, this piece has dropped out of sight, perhaps held by some private collector. By the extant descriptions of it, this (magical item) showed (item maker's name)'s distinctive style in the many small touches (he/she) puts on all (his/her) work: the embossed brass fittings with (his/her) signature stamp, the unusual choice of an enameled finish, and especially the mellow amber sparking along its exterior flow lines.  (not on display) In this case, the note is a red herring. Instead, you must find and talk to the scholar. See Path II to proceed. If you have already done this and did not learn the location of the item, see this section. Path II: The Scholar[edit] As it is often the case with the quests, the scholar can be male... ...or female The second approach involves finding the expert you were told about. Travel to the scholar's dungeon named by the Guildmagister, enter it, then find and speak to the scholar. Scenario 1[edit] In this case, the scholar is immediately helpful and says: ""Hullo. (Item maker's name)'s (magical item) you say? Yes, I believe I ran across a reference to that very thing just last week. Where did I put those notes ... Here we are, mmm- hmm, ""mellow amber sparking"" -- that's vintage (item maker's name) for sure. Looks like it was in (magical item's dungeon), at least it was when this was written. Good luck!"" Travel to the dungeon the scholar mentioned and search for the magical item within its depths. Scenario 2[edit] The Alchemist  Sometimes though, the scholar doesn't have all the answers. In this case, you will be told: ""Good morning! Did (alchemist's name) send you with those supplies that I ordered? Oh, (Guildmagister's name) said I might know where to find (item maker's name)'s (magical item)? I'm sorry, but that seems to have disappeared shortly after (his/her) death, and hasn't been heard of since. A real shame. But could you do me a favor since you're here? I need a few things for my work here, and if you could fetch them for me, I'd be most grateful."" If you reply that you don't want to run errands, the scholar will be disappointed and say: ""Too busy, eh? Well, it was nice talking to you. I won't walk you to the door, if you don't mind. Good day!"" There is no use in staying any longer in this dungeon. If you have not already done so, travel to the dungeon where the catalogue can be found as in Path I. If you have, and the note was of no help, see this section. Instead, if you reply that you are willing to do the scholar's errands, you are told: ""Excellent. Here, let me jot down what I need. Take this list to (alchemist's name) of (alchemist's store) in (town). (He/She)'s the only one I trust to give me the exact ingredients I need. I'll expect you back here within (scholar's time limit) days. Please be prompt."" The scholar's shopping list reads as follows: (Alchemist's name) --  Please send me: 3 doz. newt's tongues (dessicated [sic]) 4.25 oz. powdered unicorn horn (pure northern ONLY!) 1 (ingredient) (FRESH this time, for (random god)'s sake) A jar of basilisk eyes  Charge to my account.  -- (Scholar's name) Travel to the town where the shop is located, enter it and speak to the alchemist, who will say: ""Another shopping list from (scholar's name), eh? I swear, if I send another shipment out to (him/her) without getting paid ... ""Charge to my account"", ha! That's rich. Listen, I'll give you the (ingredient) (he/she) asked for, but the rest will have to be special ordered, and I'm not doing that until (he/she) pays me for everything else I've sent to (him/her). I'm sorry, but that's the best I can do."" Once the alchemist gives you the ingredient, return to and speak with the scholar, who responds: ""Oh, it's you. Did you bring me the supplies I asked for? What, (alchemist's name) would only give you this (ingredient)? That crusty old goat! I'll give (him/her) a piece of my mind when I get out of here. Well, it's better than nothing I suppose. Listen, are you still looking for that (magical item)? I ran across a reference to an old catalogue from an exhibition of (item maker's name)'s works. This catalogue is in (catalogue's dungeon). In fact, I can teleport you to the very spot, if you like. You'll have to find your own way out, of course. Shall I teleport you to (catalogue's dungeon)?"" If you agree, the scholar will see you off by saying: ""Hold on to your hat! By the way, before you go, take this (random magical item). I really do appreciate you fetching the (ingredient) for me. Now, away to (catalogue's note dungeon)."" If you don't want to be teleported to the note, then the scholar will say: ""As you wish. By the way, before you go, take this (random magical item). I really do appreciate you fetching the (ingredient) for me. I hope you find the (magical item)."" If you agreed to be teleported to the note, you will emerge in the dungeon with the note right at your feet as if you had followed the first path. Pick it up and read it. If the note reveals the name of the dungeon where the magical item can be found, head there and retrieve it. Note that the scholar may not actually teleport you to the loot pile containing the quest item. He may instead teleport you to another random loot pile within the same dungeon, which can result in you ending up in another room or even underwater. Recovering the Item[edit] Once you know which dungeon holds the item you seek, the remainder of the quest is simply to head there and find it within. When you have found the item, a notification appears: This is undoubtedly (item maker's name)'s (magical item). Return to the Guildmagister and deliver the item for your reward. Dead Ends[edit] This scenario only has a 25% chance of occurring. In this case, the catalogue note says nothing about the location of the magical item. Additionally, when you meet the scholar, you are told that the whereabouts of the item are also unknown to them, and you will be asked to run the errand. If you found the catalogue first, you already know the note says nothing about the magical item, so doing this will not help you find it. Since neither the note nor the scholar know the location of the magical item, you cannot find it. In this case, your only option is to return empty-handed to the Guildmagister, so running the errand is up to you. If you refuse the scholar's offer, simply head back to the Mages Guild. If you wish to run the scholar's errand anyway, you are free to do so (and you will still receive a random magical item for your trouble). But there is nothing to gain by being teleported back to the note's location. Your only option is, again, to return to the Guildmagister and report that the search was in vain. Reward[edit] Upon returning to the Guildmagister with the magical item, he will say: ""Who are you? Oh good heavens, I remember now. (item maker's name)'s (magical item), of course! And here it is. Well, as it happens, while you were gone, I had quite a breakthrough in my research.

I don't know if you are worthy of such favor. In fact, I doubt it very much. I suppose that if I demanded that you murder a priest who has been saying very, very rude things about me, you would refuse even that small, simple request. Would you do that for me?""

Return the book to either Gortwog or Barenziah for a reward.","Queen Barenziah needs your help Gortwog has an offer for you as well  Barenziah's Other Biography[edit] After you have met the quest requirements, you will receive a message: A page wearing the colors and pale yellow rose of Wayrest appears silently at your side. He hands you a letter and disappears as quietly as he arrived. Check your inventory to find the letter, which reads: Castle Wayrest Dear (player's name), My beloved son has brought your name to my attention, and suggested that we might have some business to discuss. I understand that we have a mutual interest. Please visit me at Castle Wayrest at your earliest possible convenience. Yours, Barenziah Queen of the Kingdom of Wayrest Travel to Castle Wayrest for an audience with the queen. Barenziah can be found on the throne room dais next to Eadwyre and Morgiah. Speak to her and she will say: ""Thank you for responding to my letter, (player's first name). It is very difficult for a queen of a powerful nation, and a queen whose home is far away, to trust any mercenary. That is why when my dear child Helseth told me about you, I was so quick to write. There is a rather sensitive situation brewing, and I need someone I can trust to correct some wayward revolutionaries. For (random gold) gold pieces, will you perform such a service for me? I am also prepared to reward you with information as well as gold."" Accept her offer, and she replies: ""I am glad to hear it. Some years ago, a disgruntled, and possibly deranged, scribe of mine wrote a biography of me which my worst enemy would call cruel and defamatory. Because the book was also excessively critical of the Empire and Septim Imperial family, it was wisely suppressed and its author executed. Unfortunately, chapters of the book resurface from time to time. I have reason to believe one chapter of the book has been purchased by the orcs of Orsinium, who are attempting to publish it. I need it removed from their stronghold, also named Orsinium. Time is of the essence. I'm sure Gortwog will not wait long. Once the chapter is safe, we will talk further about your ambitions."" The Stronghold of Orsinium is found in the Orsinium Area region and appears on your map as a dungeon. Head there to retrieve the offending manuscript. The time limit for this quest lasts several months starting from when you receive Barenziah's letter, but you may still wish to hurry; if you don't get it within six days of speaking with the queen, the manuscript will be stolen by the Necromancers. If You Beat the Necromancers to Orsinium[edit]  Upon entering the stronghold, you will find yourself in the main hall together with Gortwog and three orcs. The warlord will not attack you unless provoked, but the soldier will attack you as soon as he detects you. Go past Gortwog and through the left door at the back of the great hall. Once you open the door, the orc shaman will attack you. Follow the hallway up and go through the door. Beware of the various orc warriors and shamans you will encounter along your way. In the bowels of the stronghold you may even encounter some Daedroths.   Follow the hallway further upward.   Follow the hallway until you come to an intersection, and from there go south.   Follow the hallway until you come to a sort of dining room. Leave the room through the west door.   Go down the hallway and through the door.   Walk down the hallway until you come to a door. Go through it and you will find yourself in a huge chamber with a hollow truncated pyramid.   The manuscript you seek is in a room down at the base of the pyramid, but the doors are magically locked. To unseal them, you need to reach the upper level. However, if you have an Open spell and can cast it a few times, you can go directly down and open the doors with your magic. Otherwise, you must unlock them first. If you cannot Levitate to the level above by yourself, jump into the fountain in the northeast corner of the chamber and it will teleport you to the platform right above the pyramid. Alternatively, you can take the staircase behind the south door, which will also lead to the upper level.   From there, take the west staircase up. At the first intersection, head east, then go south to reach a second intersection. Head east again past a third intersection and turn north at the fourth intersection. If you follow this way to the end you will encounter an orc warlord standing just in front of a handwheel. Kill him and turn the wheel; it will unlock the doors down in the truncated pyramid.   Go back and down to the bottom of the pyramid – either jump or use magic. Take care of the various orcs that are waiting at the bottom and enter the east room. The manuscript you seek is just in front of you on a pedestal. To get out of the pyramid, either levitate or pull the lever in the east room. It will assemble some stairs that you can climb to reach a handwheel. Turning this wheel will teleport you to the platform above the pyramid. Return the manuscript either to Barenziah or Gortwog. The manuscript which you seek  If the Necromancers Beat You to the Book[edit] If you haven't retrieved the book within six days, you will receive a vision: A misty shape forms in your mind. An orc shaman! It gives way to a regal orc, wearing a crown. "" [sic]The book you are looking for is no longer in Orsinium. The Necromancers have stolen it from us. If you are available, we are interested in pooling our resources against this mutual enemy. Please do not be so foolish as to assume that the orcs are your enemy, simply because we are orcs. If you are interested, come to me at Orsinium Hall in Orsinium. The face vanishes, leaving you with only a memory. If you wish to answer his bidding, head to the Stronghold of Orsinium and enter. Take care of any attackers and speak to Gortwog, who says: ""Hello, (player's name). It would seem that we have a mutual antagonist in the King of Worms. I am Gortwog, King of the Orcs and Lord of Orsinium. I am willing to give you a (jewelry) if you would retrieve the chapter of Barenziah's book from Scourg Barrow in the Dragontail Mountains, where the King and his Necromancers have taken it. Agreed?"" Agree, and Gortwog sends you off by saying: ""Very good. Off with you then."" Reject his offer, and he says: ""What a shame. Ah well, we'll hire some other mercenary then."" Note that even if you refuse his offer, you can still go to Scourg Barrow and retrieve the book. Travel to Scourg Barrow in the Dragontail Mountains. It will be easiest to leave this place if you drop a Recall anchor near the entrance.   In the first room of Scourg Barrow, open the second coffin from your left to reveal a secret pitfall.   Drop down and follow the passage to a room with eight doors and two zombies doors, go through the door immediately to your left.   Follow the hallway until you reach a fork.   Instead of turning left, which would lead you to the King of Worms, turn right and go up, past a grizzly bear. Open the door at the end of the hallway and descend into the rift. There is no path leading down, so you must either jump down or use magic.   Follow the rift south, engage the animals along the way and then turn east.   Follow the rift further south, but beware of humanoid enemies along the way.   Turn west and you will eventually reach a spot with four passages. The first passage north leads to the book, but it is blocked by a closed portcullis. There is a hidden passage to the south. Although it is well hidden, it is clearly visible on your map. Clicking the wall of the cave will open this passage; follow it.   When you reach a small circular cave, kill the foe there and turn the handwheel on the ground. This will open the portcullis.   Go back to the rift and enter the now open passage to the north.   The manuscript which you seek Follow the hallway and you will reach a room with two mummies and a lich. Destroy them all and pick up the book's page lying on a pedestal. Return it either to Barenziah or Gortwog.  Returning the Book[edit] The manuscript in question is a copy of The Real Barenziah, Part VI. You are free to read it if you wish so. You have the choice of either giving the book back to Barenziah or to Gortwog. If you give the book to Gortwog, he rewards you with a random piece of jewelry (see bugs), and says: ""Very well done, (player's first name). Here is your (jewelry). Nevermind what I will do with this chapter. However, I would steer clear of Queen Barenziah for a while if I were you."" If you give the book to Barenziah, the reward will be a random amount of gold (plus information if you snatched the book from the Necromancers). Return the book to Queen Barenziah and she will say: ""Very well done. Prince Helseth did not exaggerate your virtues. Here is the (random gold) gold pieces I promised."" If you recovered the book from Scourg Barrow, the queen also offers up some information (see bugs). She says: ""Thank Boethiah you found it before those horrible orcs could retrieve it again. I heard all about them losing the chapter to the King of Worms. (Random god), what a crisis it would have been if they had published it. Here is (random gold) gold for your services.

Choose how you want to approach the quest.","Once your character has reached level 5 you can begin with your second task, finding out what has happened to the emperor's letter. First you must have a little conversation with Cyndassa, a maid at Castle Daggerfall. In the course of this conversation, she will offer you a deal; If you can manage to kill a werewolf for her, she will tell you everything she knows about the letter. She doesn't mention why she wants this werewolf dead though. She also reveals the dungeon where this werecreature can be found, the Tristore Laboratory on the Island of Betony, so set sail to reach the island. Finding the Werewolf[edit] The Tristore Laboratory Although the werewolf can be found very easily, the monsters that inhabit the dungeon are rather tough. You will come up against spellcasters, including Ancient Liches (even at lower levels), as well as Daedroths and Atronachs. The werewolf is very close to the dungeon's entrance, in fact it is only a few steps away from it.   From the entrance, walk south until you come to an intersection, head east following the hallway, then go through the door at the end.   You have reached a huge room and the werewolf will be in the northwestern corner of this room. Jump down the ledge and kill it. There is a treasure pile on the top of the ramp in the middle of the room. Return to Cyndassa after you have accomplished the task.  The Alternative Way[edit]  Cyndassa's friend, the witch The other way to complete this quest, which doesn't involve killing the werewolf, is broken as mentioned in the opening statement, unless you install the third party patch. If you have done this you can complete the quest via this alternative path. For the beginning collect two diary entries, that can also be found in the Tristore Laboratory, and read them. The locations of these diary entries are shown in the image to the left. Once you have read them, exit the Tristore Laboratory and travel back to the mainland of Daggerfall. Travel to the town mentioned in the brother's diary and ask about Cyndassa's friend, the witch, until you know the town she is currently staying; by the way, you can ask in any settlement in the Daggerfall region for her whereabouts. Once you know the town, travel there and if you don't know the tavern she is staying at already, ask further until you come up with its name. When you have found her and talk to her, there are two possibilities: When your reputation with Br'itsa, The Daggerfall Witches or The Sisters of The Bluff is smaller than 4 the witch will join you to capture the werewolf. When your reputation with Br'itsa, The Daggerfall Witches or The Sisters of The Bluff is at least 4 the witch will give you a magical item you must carry with you to capture the werewolf. Capturing the Werewolf[edit] Going with the witch[edit] After the witch has joined you, travel with her back to the Tristore Laboratory on the island of Betony. As soon as you enter the dungeon the witch suggest that you both split up to reach the werewolf. Go to the location the werewolf can be found and the witch will already be there. Hit the werewolf once with a silver or better weapon to draw blood, but don't kill it. Once it has been injured, the witch will cast a spell, paralyzing the werewolf. Wait for an in-game-minute until the spell has shifted the werewolf back to its humanoid form. Once this has been accomplished. the witch will thank you for helping her and basically tell you the same story Cyndassa would have told you, had you killed the werewolf for her (Cyndassa told her everything after a glass of wine). The witch will ask one more favor from you, escort her and the transformed brother to the Coven on The Bluff in Daggerfall, she will mark the coven on your map. Escort both of them there before the quest's second time-limit has run out and wait at the coven for two in-game minutes until the witch starts speaking to you again. She will once again thank you and tells you you are always welcome to visit there. Going without the witch[edit] Travel back to the Tristore Laboratory on the island of Betony and enter the dungeon. Once you have reached the location of the werewolf, hit it once with a silver or better weapon to draw blood but don't kill it. Once the werwolf has been injured, the magical item in your inventory will paralyze the werewolf and within an in-game minute it will shift it back to its humanoid form. Take the transformed brother back to the witch. When you bring the brother back, the witch will thank you for your help and basically tell you the same story Cyndassa would have told you, had you killed the werewolf for her. You may also keep the magical item she gave you as a reward. Special Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] You will gain reputation according to the table below if you either bring the brother back to the witch or both of them to the Coven on The Bluff before the quest's second time-limit has expired: Faction/Person Reputation Gain   Daggerfall +10   Court of Daggerfall +10   Associated Factions +5   The Sisters of The Bluf +12   Br'itsa & Julianos +15   School of Julianos & associated factions +8 (Allies/Enemies affiliations for listed factions are not considered) Depending on your actions during this quest you may also lose reputation with the Sisters of The Bluff as seen below: Action Reputation Gain   Reporting back to the witch after killing the werewolf -10   Reporting back to the witch after a failed capture but without killing the werewolf -5"

Talk to her and she will say: ""Hey, if I told you I could give you a bit of information, let's say, about that letter of milady, would you be innerested there, (player's first name)? I thought so. Now, mind you, I ain't givin' it away. Before I scratch yer back, you gotta scratch mine. Deal?"" Accept her offer and she will elaborate: ""Me name is Cyndassa. Daggerfall. I'll tell you everything I know, but I don't need to remind you that there ain't no such thing as free info, do I, (player's name)? I'm just a maid to her highness, nothing but a fleck to the world, and my needs ain't big. I need this werewolf done in. I know just where it is -- some (random god) forsook hole called (dungeon). I can't tell you why, but it's important to me that that werewolf gets put outta its misery. I'll wait here for (time limit) days for you -- that oughta be plenty of time."" Slaying the Werebeast[edit] Travel to the dungeon Cyndassa named, find the werewolf inside, and kill it. There may be more than one werewolf depending on the type of dungeon and your character's level, but you must slay the specified target creature to successfully complete the quest. When the werewolf dies, you receive the following message: The body of the werewolf begins to transform before your very eyes. In just a few minutes, it has become a young man who seems to bear a strong resemblance to Cyndassa. Cyndassa's Story[edit] Return to Cyndassa after killing the werewolf and she will say: ""It's dead then, is it? Poor thing. He used to be my brother. If you ask me, he died long ago, when he first got bit. He hated himself when he became that beast. I wish there'd been another way to help him. I promised I'd tell you about that letter yer lookin for, didn't I now? Of course, I remember that letter, (player's name). It's not every day that you gets a letter from the Emperor himself, especially seein' as the King ain't too fond of him. 'Fact, that's the only letter I ever seen from him. I give it to her majesty, and she's all excited and she rip it open and says ""this isn't for me, this is addressed to Mynisera."" Then... boom! Her jaw fall open and her eyes get real wide. She say she'll make sure the Queen Mother gets it and that I don't have to worry myself none about it.""

If you didn't give the sister her ""present"" head back to your employer. Give your employer the item within the time limit and collect your reward.","A Special Gift[edit] Speak to a Merchant or Innkeeper, who says: ""Excuse me? (Employer's name) is the name. I don't know how I feel about you, but I do need a favor. My sister, (sister's name), is having a birthday next month and I could really use some (item) for the celebration. It's worth (random gold) gold pieces. What do you say?"" Accept[edit] The merchant or innkeeper goes on: ""Excellent! You are a smart one. This is easy gold. Go to (local store) and find (merchant's name), (He/She) has the specific (item) I need. Remember, there is only a month 'til the celebration."" or ""Very good. This is easy gold. You'll have to go to (local store) to find the exact kind I need. Talk to (merchant's name), (he/she) runs the place."" Decline[edit] The merchant or innkeeper answers: ""Just as well, I suppose. Good day."" ""Sorry I asked."" ""Then we never talked, I'd hate for you to spoil the surprise."" ""Whatever, it was easy gold you know."" ""Leave me then, I have a celebration to plan."" Buying the Ingredient[edit] Head to a local shop to find the item The merchant requires gold Your employer's sister spends her time at home  Head to the local store mentioned by your employer. Find the merchant, who says: ""Hello. Yes, I am (merchant's name). Some (item)? Yes I have it. I'll take your 20 gold pieces and you can have the (item)."" Depending on whether or not you have the gold, the merchant finishes with: ""Thanks for stopping by."" Or, ""Oh, I'm sorry. You don't seem to have enough gold to pay for that."" Buying the requested item, an ingredient, costs 20 gold. Note that you must pay with gold pieces, letters of credit will not be accepted. Once you have the item, you have two choices; you can simply return to your employer and deliver the item for your promised reward and complete the quest, or you can show the item to your employer's sister. If you wish to show the ingredient to the sister, you must first find her by asking around in town. Once you know where she lives, enter her home and speak to her. The quest can then proceed in one of two directions: Spoiling the Surprise[edit] When you show the item to your employer's sister, she says: ""Hello? Why are you here? You say, (employer's name) wants some (item) for my birthday celebration? Oh, what a wonderful idea! I promise not to spoil the surprise!"" You then have the option of giving her the item. If you choose to do so, she says: ""I'll take it, I guess. But doesn't this ruin the surprise? You are a strange one, (player's name)."" Note that if you give the item to the sister, you cannot deliver the item to your employer anymore, and thus cannot complete the quest successfully. If you keep it, deliver it to your employer for your reward. Spoiling the (Deadly) Surprise[edit] When shown the item, the sister may instead say: ""Hello? How did you get in here? What? (employer's name) asked you to bring (him/her) some (item)? Oh my ... do you have any idea what he plans to do with it? I do. (Item) is part of a potion that my loving brother likes to make. A potion that kills. You must not give it to (him/her)! Please! Bring the (item) to me. You must do this, or I may be killed!"" If you choose to give her the item, she says: ""Thank you, my brother cannot use it now. You have done well. Thank you."" Again, if you give her the item you cannot complete the quest. However, the choice is yours to live with, and you will lose reputation regardless of your choice (see below). Reward[edit] When you return with the item and hand it over, your employer says: ""Very good, (player's name). Here's the gold I promised.""

Helseth can be found Castle Wayrest, sitting on a table in the dining hall behind the throne room. Speak to him, and he gets straight to the point: ""I need a courier, (player's first name), but no common, jelly-armed, gas-headed pox of a mercenary will do. I have a letter of utmost importance to be delivered to a high dignitary who will be defended against unwelcome intrusion. In return for this, I will not only reward you with a (magical item), but also put in a positive word for you with the king and queen of Wayrest, but I will give you some information on the affair with Daggerfall I doubt you would receive elsewhere.

After a day has passed, return and speak to Helseth again. He greets you by saying: ""Ah, hello again, (player's first name). Here is the letter. It is to be given to Lord Castellian, the head of the elder council, who is currently at his house (residence) in (town). I need the letter delivered and you back here in no later than (time limit) days -- that is essential. Like I mentioned before, Lord Castellian values his privacy to an excess. Be prepared for some resistance at your arrival in (residence). I would ask that you not read the letter as it is private correspondence. If word of its contents gets out, I will blame you."" At this point, you have several options: proceed with the quest as instructed, read the letter, or you may alternatively deliver it to King Eadwyre instead of Lord Castellian. Once the letter is in your possession, you can ignore Helseth's instructions and take a look at it. The letter reads as follows: My Dear Lord Castellian, Sorry about the necessity of delivering this letter by the roughest possible service, but it would be unthinkable to approach you at the castle on such a delicate matter. I have long admired your loyalty to the crown and neutrality in internal affairs. Understand that I only want to save your dignity from a possibly embarrassing scenario. The problem rests in your sister, the Lady Pasipha, who though she resides abroad still communicates regularly with members of court. I understand and respect the depth of your sibling love and affection for one another, for, in response to a curious inquiry of mine, Lady Pasipha sent me several touching letters penned in your hand. ""Have you ever espied with delight a red berry half-drowned in cream? So I dream of you, my dearest love, pouring my soul into you, sweet, for your touch, dear, my soul is quite forfeit."" While your and I know the innocence of your fondness for the lady, the more prurient minds at court, as you are aware, are inclined toward grotesque misinterpretation. Her husband, I understand, is famous for his jealous rages. I am of several minds on the matter, how to best avoid possible negative reaction, and would appreciate your response at the soonest possible opportunity. I will await you at Castle Wayrest. Helseth, Prince of Wayrest The missive is an obvious attempt at blackmail. Note that if you decide to read it, your reputation with the nobles of Wayrest will fall, and you will not be able to successfully complete the quest. If you wish to expose Helseth's scheme, speaking to Eadwyre at this point will deliver him the letter (regardless of whether or not you read it). The king grows incensed at his stepson: ""Why that conniving, manipulative weasel. You did well by bringing this to my attention, (player's first name). Thank you."" This will earn you some reputation with King Eadwyre and Wayrest, but also means you fail the quest (see below); you will not receive a reward from the prince. Speedy Delivery[edit] The Lord prefers nondescript lodgings To continue the quest, travel to the city where Lord Castellian lives and locate his residence. Enter and deliver the letter to him, which triggers the following: You wait while Lord Castellian reads the letter. His skin grows pale and his hand begins to shake. ""I see. Please wait while I pen a response to Prince Helseth."" It only takes him a minute to write the response, which he then hands you. Return to Prince Helseth with this letter to receive your reward. Be aware that reading Lord Castellian's reply will cause your reputation with Helseth and Wayrest to drop precipitously (though the prince will still give you the reward he promised). Lord Castellian's response reads: Prince Helseth, I appreciate your kindness, and I will meet with you very shortly at your convenience."" [sic] Lord Castellian Two of Lord Castellian's minions, a battlemage and a knight However, if you have read Helseth's letter before delivering it to Lord Castellian, he will realize something is amiss: ""This letter has been opened.

Lord Castellian will speak no further on the matter, but he will send several knights and battlemages after you who speak for him, saying: ""Lord Castellian has ordered your death. He wanted me to tell you that you know too much."" He will not give you a reply letter in this case, and you will not receive a reward from Prince Helseth. You also have the option of delivering Lord Castellian's response to King Eadwyre, for the same reputation gain as with Helseth's letter. This also means you fail the quest and miss out on the prince's reward, however. Reward[edit] Deliver Lord Castellian's response to Prince Helseth. He gives you the promised magic item and the information he promised: ""Anyway, here is the (magical item) I promised. Never let it be said that Prince Helseth is not a man of his bond. Oh yes, I promised to tell you something of the situation in Daggerfall. I suspect my family has more to do with it than is commonly known.

The Holy and Unholy Paths[edit] Take the holy item and head to the town mentioned by the noble. Until you have delivered the item, a group of vampires led by a vampire ancient will pursue you every day from 17:31 to 05:49, unless you are in fast-travel mode for the entire night.

Report your findings to Aubk-i and receive your reward from the queen.","Queen Aubk-i needs you to check on Nulfaga... ...in far-away Castle Shedungent A Queen In Need[edit] After reaching level 3, speak with Queen Aubk-i in Castle Daggerfall. She tells you that Nulfaga the sorceress (Gothryd's grandmother) has not been the same since the death of her son Lysandus: ""My husband's poor grandmother, Nulfaga, is rumored to be in very frail health, her once brilliant mind almost utterly destroyed. She has locked herself in her castle in the Wrothgarian Mountains and experiments in magical studies with no regard for her own safety. I would know of her condition, but few possess the bravery to face the horrors of her castle and speak with her. My reward for a report on her health is a (magical item). Will you be my champion in this?"" If you accept your offer, she will thank you: ""(Oath), I am glad to have found a champion. The name of her castle is Shedungent, and it should not take more than 150 days to go there. If she is insane, Shedungent may be a very dangerous place indeed. Be very careful. May Kynareth and Mara protect you.""  Castle Shedungent[edit] Travel to Shedungent in the Wrothgarian Mountains. The entrance is up a small flight of steps on the south side of the central tower. Once inside, immediately ahead to the north is a door. Beside it, the wall is adorned with a tapestry bearing the colors and crest of Daggerfall. This is the entrance to Nulfaga's throne room. Unfortunately, the door is magically locked. If you lack the ability to cast Open spells, you must find an alternate means of entry. The most obvious way to get into the throne room is through the dungeons.  Go west from the entrance and follow the passage; go up some stairs.   You will come to an intersection. Go west and then south at the next branch, than once again west. You will pass under a portcullis.   Continue down the corridor and through the door to the south, go down the precipitous stairs.   Go north past the two intersections to the west.   Go further north and through the door, head west a few steps and go through the door to the north. You will find yourself in a huge grotto.   Go north across the rope bridge spanning the abyss.   Once across the bridge, go north through the door than east until you reach the end of the hallway. Turn south.   Head further south and up the ramp. Follow the hallway east until it ends, then turn south.   Go further south until you reach the throne room of Castle Shedungent. Go up the stairs and you will find Nulfaga on the second level.  The Throne Room[edit] Castle Shedungent's throne room is a large hall flanked by staircases, with banners of the Kingdom of Daggerfall draped from the ceiling. Small living and dining areas are accessible to the east and west, and the magically locked door from before is in the south wall. Both the hall and adjoining rooms may be occupied, so be prepared to fight or sneak past any enemies within. Head up the stairs on either side of the room to find Nulfaga standing before the throne. Speaking to Nulfaga is not productive, as she rambles on in madness. Her dialogue has several iterations, but the common thread in each is a line including the words ""door"" and ""shut up"" in some manner.

I obviously must retrieve those bricks before they discover that the gold is foscarium, which may be in (time limit) days or less.

Decline[edit] The merchant or innkeeper answers: ""No? Really? Very well. Someone else will be more agreeable, I'm certain of that."" Gather the ""Gold""[edit] Regardless of what your employer said when giving you the quest (and what your logbook will tell you), you will only get paid for one specimen of foscarium, regardless how many you retrieve altogether. This makes successfully completing the quest much easier than it sounds as you only need to find and return with one of the four bricks. As your employer stated, the four samples are located in a bank, a dungeon, a palace, and a residence, all across the region. The time limit for this quest is not very forgiving, but given that you only need one sample for a successful completion it shouldn't be much of an issue. The simplest brick of false gold to retrieve is the one in the bank; when you visit the building during its regular business hours you won't even need to pick the entry door's lock. Sometimes the bank will be guarded by a pair of battlemages, and more guards may appear after you have picked up the false gold, but they shouldn't be too much trouble. Fight or escape after picking up the false brick and bring it back to your employer (or go after more foscarium if you wish). The palace and the residence are much the same, but guarded by knights and spellswords, respectively. Additionally, the residence may be locked at all times so be prepared. The dungeon is a simple dungeon crawl; the false gold will be at a random quest location within. When you are ready to complete the quest, return to your employer for your reward. Reward[edit] Upon returning with an exemplar of the false gold, your employer says: (Oath), well done, (player's first name). I was afraid I hadn't given you enough time.

However, unlike most quests, the burglar will not vanish after taking the item.

It is a letter, addressed to you in an elegant flowing script. How did that get there? Check your inventory for the letter and read it: (Date) Dear (player's name), Or should I call you ""(monster's name),"" as you are known to the common folk of (region), who bar their doors against you in fear each night? Yes, I know who and what you are, and your days of terrorizing the Iliac Bay are numbered. I offer you a simple choice: renounce your lycanthropy, or be hunted down like the wild beast you are. Let no one say that (hunter's name) lacks compassion. I offer you one last chance to save yourself. Go to (priest(ess)'s name) of (temple) in (town) if you wish to live. (He/She) is wise in the ways of lycanthropy, and if anyone can help you, (he/she) can. I will wait (time limit) days before sending my hunters after you. Use the time wisely. (Hunter's name) The Priest and the Lycanthrope[edit] The priest If you want to cure yourself of lycanthropy (and avoid being hunted), travel to the town named in the letter, find the temple, and speak to the priest(ess), who will say: ""You must be (player's name). (Hunter's name) said you might be coming to see me, although (he/she) doubted that you would heed (his/her) warning. Sadly, most do not, already too befuddled by the Beast within to save themselves. Yes, the curse of lycanthropy can be lifted, although I hesitate to speak of it, as the cure may be worse than the disease. We must lower our voices. You may not be aware that lycanthropy is an [sic] hereditary condition, passed on in certain families, although it can lie dormant for generations before reappearing. This is why the great crusades against lycanthropes led by those like (hunter's name) are ultimately futile, unless the families who carry this bloodline are exterminated as well. You now understand why I am reluctant to share this knowledge. As you know, the bite of a werebeast can pass the infection on to a new victim. However, if you can pass the infection to a latent lycanthrope, the curse will be lifted from you due to the intensity of its blossoming in the victim. My studies have recently uncovered a family which I am sure carries the disease. If you still wish to proceed on this dark course, I can tell you where to find the last survivor of this ancient, cursed bloodline."" You are then asked: Do you wish to seek out a victim in order to cure your lycanthropy? Your answer determines how you will approach the quest.  Finding the Cure[edit] Approach I[edit] The Alchemist[edit] The alchemist The blood of a beast (you) If you answer ""Yes"", the priest(ess) answers: ""Very well. I cannot blame you for wishing to live. I comfort myself with the thought that (father's name) is the last of a doomed family, best ended before the curse renews itself. Yes, he is the one. As far as I know, he still lives in (family town), the family home for generations. But first, you will need to see (alchemist's name) in (alchemist's town). (He/She) has assisted me in such matters before. The surest way to pass on the disease is for the victim to drink the blood of the lycanthrope. (Alchemist's name) will ask no questions and tell no tales at your strange request. May (random god) guide your steps."" Travel to the alchemist's town, ask around to learn the location of his or her shop, and enter it. When you speak to the alchemist, you will hear: ""So, another visitor from (priest(ess)'s name). Yeah, I know what you want, but it ain't cheap. 1000 gold up front. Take it or leave it."" The alchemist requires 1000 gold coins, letters of credit will not do. If you have the gold, the alchemist draws some of your blood and gives it to you, adding: ""Alright then, hold still a minute. There you go, didn't hurt a bit, right? Now get outta here before one of my respectable customers sees you."" If you don't have the required gold, you will instead be sent away until you can come up with it: ""Sorry pal, you haven't got enough cash. Move it before I call the guards."" With your blood in hand, the next step is to find the individual from the lycanthropic bloodline.  Locate the Last Latent Lycanthrope[edit] A friend of the family Travel to the town where the father of the family is said to live and ask for him in town. You will learn that he died some years ago, but he left behind a child. Asking for rumors might tell you where the child can now be found. You may also learn of a former friend of the father living in town. Seek out and speak to this friend, who tells you: ""You're looking for (father's name)? I'm afraid that he died three years ago. Killed himself, actually, although very few know that part of it. I'm not sure what happened, but he became very moody, and began disappearing for days at a time. Left a note saying something about he couldn't live with himself, and didn't want (child's name) to find out the truth about it. I never figured out what it was all about. Yes, (child's name) was his only child. (He/She) was taken in by a family from (child's town) after (his/her) father's death. I'm afraid that's all I know.""  The Orphaned Child[edit] The child before... ...and after the transformation Travel to this new town and locate the target residence by asking around. Once you know where to go, enter the house. Speak to the child while carrying the werewolf blood, and you will be asked: ""Hello. Are you a doctor? I haven't been feeling very well today. Is that medicine you have there for me?"" You are then prompted: Do you give the blood to (child's name)? At this point, it is still possible to back out and leave the child be. If you choose ""No,"" you can then return to the temple, speak to the priest(ess) again and embark upon Approach II (or simply abandon your search and face the hunter's wrath). If you choose ""Yes,"" your portrait appears, showing your once again non-lycanthropic self. However, something terrible also happens: As (child's name) drinks your blood, you feel your mind clear for the first time since you were afflicted with lycanthropy. But (child's name) cries out in agony as (he/she) changes form right before your eyes. With that, you are no longer afflicted. Unfortunately, the cure comes with a cost: in addition to awakening the child's inner wereboar, your Regional Reputation will drop by ten points. The shapeshifted youngster will immediately attack you in a mindless rage. You may fight or flee, it makes no difference as the quest is now complete. However, killing the wereboar will lower your Regional Reputation an additional twenty points.  Approach II[edit] A Long Shot[edit] If you answer the priest(ess)'s question with ""No"" you will hear: ""I understand. In fact, I am almost relieved that you shun this road to salvation. It shows that the Beast does not yet wholly dominate you. I would not offer false hope, but if you still wish to try to cure yourself ... Well, this is no more than a legend, but supposedly there is a coven somewhere which can cure lycanthropy. The best lead I can offer is an ancient text, ""A History of the Daedric Sects."" Unfortunately, the only existing copy disappeared in the sack of (book dungeon) over a century ago. Perhaps it remains hidden somewhere in the ruins there. If nothing else, the search might help you keep the Beast at bay, at least for a while. May (random god) guide your steps."" Finding Answers[edit] The cure Travel to the dungeon the priest(ess) mentioned to search for the legendary tome. Most of the book is lost to the ages, but eventually you will come across a scrap of paper. Pick it up and read it: This appears to be a page torn from a book: ...""reputed to have the ability to raise the dead, although as yet the Conclave has not unearthed any evidence of this beyond the usual legends and anecdotes. By contrast, the existence of the Glenmoril Coven is firmly rooted in history. In fact, this coven is of such antiquity that its very origins have been lost. The Circle of Seven, as it is often called (the Glenmoril Coven regards thirteen as a newfangled corruption of the original seven Initiates plus six Acolytes -- one for each of the Circle except for the Mistress, who is considered above such apprenticeship duties). As usual, legend mixes with fact in the popular belief that the Glenmoril Coven possesses the cure for lycanthropy. Complete documentation of these legends may be found in the library of (map dungeon). The Iliac Bay region is also home to another of..."" This is apparently the text you were looking for, and it provides another lead. Travel to the new dungeon mentioned on the book's page, and search within to find a map, which reveals the location of the Glenmoril Coven in the Ilessan Hills. Acquiring this information does not provide any immediate benefits. However, you now know the location of one of the fourteen Witch Covens in the Iliac Bay. To cure yourself of lycanthropy once and for all, you must travel to the Glenmoril Coven and obtain the quest A Special Mixture from the beldam. It might take a couple of tries to get this quest. Once you have the ""Pure water"" from that quest, use it and it will cure you of lycanthropy. This ""potion"" also works also for Vampirism.

Meet the second vampire in time and obtain the location of your bloodline's bloodfather. Travel to the dungeon where your bloodfather lives. Destroy your bloodfather within the time limit to be cured of vampirism.","Becoming the Hunted[edit] If you are a vampire, you will notice something one night: An unfamiliar object in your pack catches your eye. It is a letter, addressed to you in an elegant flowing script. How did that get there? Open your inventory and read the letter: (Date) Dear (player's name) of (bloodline),     Let me introduce myself. I am (hunter's name). You may have heard of me -- the renowned vampire hunter? Do not be hasty in your judgment of me, however. I am not your enemy, at least not yet. While I abhor vampirism with a passion, and have devoted my life to stamping out this dark plague from Tamriel, I understand that many are innocent victims like yourself. The will to live is not of itself evil, and I always try to offer my quarry one chance to prove that their bloody work is based on necessity, not love for killing.     I am sure that your ""kinfolk"" have not told you this, but vampirism can be cured. To do so, you must kill your ""bloodfather"", the ancient evil that created the line of vampires leading to you. In doing so, you will not only free yourself, but rid (region) of a cancer at its heart.     I myself do not know where to find your ""bloodfather,"" but my sources have revealed the name of one high in (bloodline) who should have this information, (first vampire's name) of (first town). I will wait (time limit) days before moving against the vampires of (region), to give you a chance to save yourself.     Consider my offer well, (player's name). You have (time limit) days, then you and the rest of (bloodline) will be hunted down like vermin. (Hunter's name) Matters of Life and (Un)Death[edit] The First Vampire[edit] The Fighters Guild colludes with many vampire tribes Proof of your trustworthiness Head to the town named in the letter. Ask around to determine your contact's location, enter the building, and speak to the vampire. If you are still carrying the hunter's letter, a prompt appears: Do you want to show (first vampire's name) the letter from (hunter's name)? If you choose ""Yes"", you show the letter to the vampire and hear: ""You have done well to bring this to me, (player's name). (Hunter's name) has been the bane of (bloodline) for years. With this advance warning, we can save the lives of many of our kinfolk. Do not underestimate the danger you are in, (player's first name). (Hunter's name) is ruthless and competent, and (his/her) spies are everywhere. (he/she) would make an excellent addition to (bloodline) -- perhaps (he/she) will yet. Be that as it may, (he/she) knows your name, and do not doubt that (he/she) will attempt to make good on (his/her) threat. May the night keep you safe."" Do this and you will fail the quest. If you wish to remain a vampire this is no real loss, save for being harassed by the vampire hunter's legion of knights for some time afterward. If you answer ""No"" (or are not carrying the letter), you are told: (Player's name), isn't it? I have heard good things about you from the rest of (bloodline). So, you want to find your bloodfather. An understandable urge, although this is a privilege not usually granted to one of your youth. However, you have made such progress in (bloodline) already, I believe I can make an exception. Let me see, he must be either (first elder's name) or (second elder's name). You can find them at (first dungeon) and (second dungeon), respectively. I would advise against intruding on an elder's seclusion lightly, however. It would be best if you looked up (second vampire's name) of (second town). (he/she [sic]) is the Keeper of the Bloodline, and will be able to tell you with certainty which of (bloodline) elders is your bloodfather. Take this bracelet to (him/her) so (he/she) will know I sent you."" Time is of the essence, so decide if you want to meet the second vampire or explore the possible dungeons on your own. Choose wisely, as the wrong dungeon will still hold a Vampire Ancient (just not the one who is your bloodfather) and he will not be happy at your intrusion: ""Stripling, do not disturb my mediations [sic]! Begone, or my hunger will force me to slay you!"" When this incorrect elder dies you receive a notification: You have slain (elder's name), Elder of (bloodline). You will not, however, be cured of your vampirism. In addition, the Elder's demise will significantly damage your reputation with his vampire bloodline. The Second Vampire[edit] The Keeper of the Bloodline To be sure which Elder is your bloodfather, head to the second town and find the second vampire there. Do so quickly, as you only have one to three days to make it to the meeting; if you miss the appointment, other vampires will discover your intention to destroy your line's bloodfather and they will start hunting you down. In addition, both your vampire contacts will henceforth be gone. If you hit one of these vampires for the first time, it will hiss: ""Bloodtraitor! We have learned of your treachery. You will never find (bloodfather's name), although your days as one of (bloodline) are about to end, do not worry. (Hunter's name) will not need to hunt you down."" Once you have located the second vampire, show the bracelet and be told: ""Hmph. You are very young to be entrusted with such information. However, since you carry (first vampire's name)'s token, I will reveal to you where your bloodfather, (second elder's name), resides. You will find him in his lair in (second dungeon). Be aware that at this time of year, the elders do not like to be disturbed by anyone. Intrude upon (second elder's name)'s solitude at your peril."" Breaking the Curse[edit] The bloodfather is not reaching out for a hug  Now that you know the location of your bloodfather for sure, travel to the dungeon and find him within. Being an Elder of the bloodline, your bloodfather will be a Vampire Ancient, so be prepared for a vicious battle. When you hit him for the first time he will hiss: ""(Player's name), your blood calls to me. Why do you strike your own father? (Bloodline) punishes patricide with death. Do not force me to carry out this sentence myself. Flee, my child!"" Destroy him for good, and your non-vampiric portrait appears, along with a notification: As (bloodfather's name) dies, you feel the curse of vampirism lift from your soul. You are no longer a vampire. Destroying your bloodfather will severely damage your reputation with his vampire bloodline, but this is likely a small price to pay for being rid of vampirism once and for all. Reputation Loss[edit] You may lose reputation during this quest with the first vampire's e.g. your bloodfather's bloodline depending on your actions.

If you refuse to surrender the book, the contact will curse you, you will lose reputation with Oblivion and the random Daedra Prince, and the Daedra will continue their attack against you. Head to the noble's contact to complete the quest. Naturally, if you gave the book to the Daedra's contact you can no longer deliver it to the noble's contact; this will result in a failed quest once the time limit has expired. But this is one of only two quests where you can improve your reputation with the Daedra Princes and Oblivion, so decide for yourself if the rewards outweigh the costs.

I hope the daedra didn't cause you too much difficulty. Ha! If they actually knew what I can use this little book for, they would have sent twice the number to stop you!

Travel to the Mad Wizard's dungeon, enter it, and locate the target. The wizard appears as a mage and will likely toss some powerful spells at you, so prepare accordingly.

To cement our friendship, I have agreed to arrange the death of a consistant [sic] threat to (him/her) -- some sort of monster. This foul parasite lives in a decrepit old place called (dungeon).

Accept[edit] The noble goes on: ""Recognize a good deal when you hear it, eh? I told (ally's name) that the monster would be dead in (time limit) days or (he/she) could go out and hire someone else.

Travel to the dungeon where the monster makes its lair, enter, and find your target. The monster can either be a battlemage, a giant, a wereboar, or a vampire; each type has a 25% chance of appearing. The target may not be the only creature of its type in the dungeon, but you will get a notification once you hit the correct one, as the creature screams: ""Who dares disturb (monster's name) the Terrible in (his/her) lair? Your skill will soon hang on my wall as a trophy!"" When you have killed the monster, the following message pops up: You have slain (monster's name). After the creature is dead, exit the dungeon and travel to the town where the noble's ally lives. Reward[edit] Once in town, you may need to ask around town to locate the noble's ally. The building where the ally is staying may be locked, so come prepared. Enter, speak to the noble's ally to get your reward and they will say: ""Yes, I've already heard word that our (monster type) pestilence is at an end.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Deadly_Knowledge","Receive a letter from a vampire of your bloodline. (Optional) Possibly receive a second letter from the Mages Guild. Meet and speak with the vampire. (Optional) Meet with the Guild mage who sent the second letter. Head to the dungeon named by the vampire or the mage. Find the sorcerer within, and retrieve the research notes one way or another. Return the notes to either the vampire or the mage within the time limit. (Optional) Collect your reward.","Notes on a Bloodline[edit] When your vampire bloodline needs you again, you receive a letter: A pale young boy hands you a letter and scampers away like a rat. Check the letter in your inventory. It reads: (Building) (Town) Dear (player's name),       Those doddering, unenlightened barbarians who call themselves the Mages Guild are involved in yet another rather pointless endeavor. This time, they may, though accidentally, be on a path toward breaking the shade and exposing (bloodline). It seems inconceivable that the Mages Guild actually accomplish anything, but we must make provision for such an eventuality.        Come see me as soon as possible at the address above. Yours in Death, (Vampire's name) The Scatterbrained Sorcerer[edit] There are two paths this quest can take; if your reputation with the Mages Guild is at least 15, an optional path will present itself. Meet the Vampire[edit] The vampires want the sorcerer's notes To follow the main path, head to the location named in the letter and meet its sender, a vampire, who says: ""Good evening, kin. The fools at the Mages Guild have blindly stumbled on a few bare facts in their aimless dissections. It is unlikely that they will get anywhere, but the mage who is leading the research is at least wise enough to hide. That, in itself, is enough for our concern. Of course, it is pointless to hide from (bloodline) anywhere in (region). (Sorcerer's name) is in (dungeon), a laboratory of sorts. I want you to get the notes for this research and bring it back to me. (Sorcerer's name), I understand, keeps the notes on (his/her) person under the laughable misconception that they are safe there. Go point out the error in (his/her) thinking, (player's first name)."" Head to the dungeon, find the sorcerer within, and attack. When hit, your opponent will scream: ""(Oath)! My precious notes! Away, bloodsucker! Away!"" Once your quarry is dead, loot the corpse to find the notes you were sent for. They read: (Bloodline) are the dominant  tribe of (region), though they are  by no means the dominant tribe of the  whole Iliac Bay region. (Fill in this  about the Montalion, Vrasethi, Ghulari,  Selenu, et cetera, blah, blah, blah  Different powers but basically same  internal structure, blah, blah, blah).  How is one cured of vampirism (find  that Vampires of the Iliac Bay book,  references to a society of former  vampires)? Slaying the preeminant [sic] member  of the same bloodline, from what I can  gather from personal interviews and  whatnot. (Note to me: that rather  (vampire's description) in (town) has  expressed interest in my work. Possible  interviewee or trap?) Vampires infiltrating  royal courts, Dark Brotherhood, even the  Mages Guild in (region) and else  where. Is the (ruler's title) of (region) under  influence of (bloodline) or perhaps  more than under the influence? Run the  standard test (pend that patent) and see  what's what. Need Nymph Hair, holy symbol,  et cetera, et cetera, fresh this time for  (random god)'s sake. Talk to (mage's name)  about increasing funding. Going nowhere. Return the notes to your bloodline contact to finish the quest. Help the Guild Mage[edit] The Mages Guild also wants the sorcerer's notes, for their own ends If your reputation with the Mages Guild is high enough, you will receive a second letter soon after the first: A courier dressed in deep blue robes hands you a letter and, with a bow, disappears. The letter reads: My Dear Old (player's name),     Whenever you might find yourself in the vicinity of (mage's town), your ubiety at (building) would be most efficacious to our present needs. In return for your support in an endeavor, I can offer you the gratification of personal economonic prosperity and the more sublime pleasure of aiding your Mages Guild compeers. I hope to see you very soon. Yours and all that, (Mage's name) You may speak to the Guild mage instead of the vampire if you wish, either one can provide you with the relevant quest details. Travel to the mage's town, enter the building named in the letter and find the mage, who says: ""Oh, oh, (oath), (player's name), is it? I, ah, understand that you are the right one for this, being sufficiently mettlesome, thewy, in short, puissant to aid (sorcerer's name), a sorceror [sic] who fears that (his/her) research has attracted the, ah, inquisitorial attention of a local tribe of vampires. Too much work had made the poor old sorceror [sic], well, oversensitive. If you would just pop on over to (his/her) lab, (dungeon), and get these precious notes, I would be very, very, ah, beholden. Just watch out for old (sorcerer's name) -- (he/she)'s a mite, ah, agitated, I understand."" Head to the dungeon and find the sorcerer the same as in the other scenario. You will still be attacked, but when you hit the spellcaster once, you will hear: ""Wait a minute! Are you the (player's race) I was supposed to give the notes to?"" Answer ""yes"" and the sorcerer will not only end the fight but also give you the notes, saying: ""My sincere apologies, (player's name). I've been very nervous lately. Here are the notes. Be careful, though. Trust no one. (Bloodline) vampires could be anyone."" If you answer ""no"" you must fight the sorcerer to the death. Search the corpse for the notes and return them to your Mages Guild contact for a reward. Reward[edit] No matter how you obtained the notes, you can return them to either contact to complete the quest. If you bring the research notes to the vampire, you are told: ""Lovely. Did you read this? Of course you did. What rot. There was another mage who had similar views of the vampiric tribes, I cannot recall his name. You've done well, young one. Very well indeed."" If you bring the research notes to the Guild mage, you will hear: ""Is this what (sorcerer's name) wanted to protect? The meandering drivel of a madman. Still, not your fault I suppose. Here's (random gold) gold pieces for your propitious conveyance."" Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] A successfully completed quest results in a reputation gain according to the table below.

Take it and read it: (Employer's name), My words will be quick. (Lover's name) is too much as you have said, and a little scare may be what is needed.

While this can be any random crypt on the Isle of Balfiera, there is a very high chance that this dungeon will be The Masoleum of Darkivaron. If so, click the link for a walkthrough. If not, carry out your search as any standard dungeon crawl. After locating and slaying the mummy, search its corpse to find a packet of midnight black powder wrapped in parchment.

You have done your part by delivering his funeral shroud which summoned us."" You can fight them off if you wish, but you ultimately cannot prevent the death of the lord. At this point, your task is complete. All that remains is to return to Elysana. However, you will be pursued by legions of Castellian's knights and spellswords, furious at you for your part in their patron's grisly demise. When hit, the first of these will shout one of: ""Death to the traitor that assasinated [sic] Lord Castellian!"" ""You shall pay for killing my liege lord."" ""Assassin! Lord Castellian was the best of men. You shall die for what you did."" Fight or flee, and return to Castle Wayrest. (Optional) Wearing the Robe[edit] So long as you have not yet delivered it, you are free to try on the robe. However, it means that you will be immediately set upon by a trio of Daedra Seducers, who when hit will say: ""Fool! Some enterprising soul has given you a robe that summoned me to slay you. How delicious!"" The robe will vanish if you slay all three Seducers, presumably returning to Oblivion with them. This makes the quest impossible to complete, as you now have nothing to bring to Lord Castellian. However, so long as one of the Daedra Seducers remains alive, you can proceed with the quest and deliver the robe to Lord Castellian as normal, though you will have to deal with three more Seducers once he puts on the robe. Reward[edit] Return to Castle Wayrest and speak to Elysana, who greets you by saying: ""Oh, how marvelous you are. Here, let me give you the (jewelry) I promised you. I hope Lord Castellian appreciates the extra work I put into the robe. It is a real attention getter now. Let me give you something more than the (jewelry), (player's first name). My father is very interested in a certain ancient relic called the Totem of Tiber Septim. He has spies all over the place looking for it. When they find it, my father will need someone to secure it. Obviously, whoever he chooses will be fabulously well rewarded. I'll give him your name. That is the least I can do.""  Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] If you successfully deliver the robe to Lord Castellian, you will gain reputation according to the table below. Faction/Person Reputation Gain   Wayrest +10   Princess Elysana +10   Associated Factions +5 (Allies/Enemies affiliations for listed factions are not considered) Enemies[edit] 3x One Daedra Seducer every one in-game minute (50% chance) if you give the robe to Lord Castellian 4x Two Knights every two in-game minutes (50% chance) as soon as Lord Castellian is attacked by the Daedra Seducers 20x Two Spellswords every fifty-three in-game minutes (15% chance) after Lord Castellian was killed by the Daedra Seducers 3x One Daedra Seducer every one in-game minute (20% chance) if you use the robe"

Find the Knights of the Dragon agent to get the name and the whereabouts of the emperor's courier. Meet the courier to talk about the letter. Report back to Mynisera.","The Dowager Queen[edit] After completing Cyndassa's quest, enter the room directly to the right of the stairs in the main throne room of Castle Daggerfall. Inside you will find the former queen, Mynisera. Speak to her, and she will say: ""Hello (player's name). I have heard much about you. Now you come to me with a very interesting tale of deception. So Cyndassa the maid says that Aubk-i opened a letter from the emperor addressed to me. I can tell you (player's first name), that she never delivered such a letter to me. I would like you to investigate this further, (player's name). It could be dangerous to poke into the affairs of Aubk-i without enraging King Gothryd, even though he is my own son. Are you willing?"" Accept her offer, and she will continue: ""Good. I have long had my suspicions about Aubk-i's loyalty to the emperor. She is a daughter of the late King Cameron [sic], who ruled Hammerfell from his citidel [sic] in Sentinel. My husband King Lysandus, (random god) rest his soul, died at Cryngaine, as did King Cameron. Lysandus [sic] body was not recovered, so he has a monument erected there rather than a true tomb. Ah...my mind wanders. The emperor uses (courier's name) as his messenger in Daggerfall. (He/She) could be anywhere in the region delivering missives. However, (courier's name) is a member of the Knights of the Dragon. Go to (knight's building) in (knight's town) and ask for (knight's name). (He/She) may know where to find (courier's name). Try to find out why a letter addressed to me was delivered to Aubk-i."" Mynisera will give you a signet ring to identify yourself to your contacts as one of her agents. Confronting Queen Aubk-i[edit] The queen seems rather abashed when questioned about the letter If you decide to question Aubk-i about the letter, she will say: ""The letter from the Emperor? Actually (player's name) this is rather embarrassing. The letter was stolen from me the same day I received it. I never did read it. I have been hoping that the letter would turn up, or the [sic] the Emperor would send another letter. If you find the letter, I would be most grateful if you would let me personally deliver it to Mynisera."" Questioning the Queen will severely lower your reputation with her and Daggerfall. She will also send nightblades after you periodically to prevent you from snooping any further. As a result, it is recommended that you avoid speaking to her until the quest is complete.  A Knight on the Town[edit] The Knights of the Dragon dispatcher serving as your contact Once you leave the castle, go to the town Mynisera told you about and ask around to learn the location of the building where your contact is waiting. Once you locate the building, speak to your contact, who will say: ""I am (knight's name). I would not normally tell anyone who is not a Knight of the Dragon where to find (courier's name). However, I am loyal to Queen Mynisera. I also know that (courier's name) disemboweled the last person that tried to ambush (him/her). In (time limit) days (he/she) is due to be at (palace) in (palace town). Try (him/her) there.""  Finding the Courier[edit] The Emperor's Courier Travel to the town your contact mentioned and look for the palace. The emperor's courier will arrive in the palace on the specified day and remain there for two days afterwards. Enter the palace and speak to the courier, who will say: ""Ho! You should be warned that I am a Knight of the Dragon in the service of the Emperor himself. If this is some ruse to ambush me, you will surely not live to regret it. Hmmm. Yes, I am (courier's name). This signet ring proves that you are indeed in the service of Mynisera. Some time ago I delivered a letter from the Emperor addressed to the Queen of Daggerfall. If I am not mistaken, Aubk-i is Queen of Daggerfall, not Mynisera. Tell Mynisera that I take my duties quite seriously. I would never knowingly deliver a missive to the wrong party. Queen Aubk-i gave me this (jewelry) in gratitude. Show it to Mynisera so that she may know I am a loyal servant and faithful to my Order.""  Report Your Findings[edit] Return to Mynisera in Castle Daggerfall and she will say: ""Ah! Now it makes sense. Uriel Septim addressed the message to the Queen of Daggerfall. When he sent it, I was queen. By the time it arrived, my dear Lysandus was dead and Aubk-i was queen. We must find out what was in that letter. I have never trusted Aubk-i. Yesterday I received a letter from Princess Morgiah of Wayrest claiming to know something of the emperor's letter. Now there is a family that seethes under the rule of the Emperor. Return to me if you find out who has the emperor's letter. For now, you have proven yourself to me (player's name). Keep the (jewelry) as a token of my gratitude.

There are four possible groups that can be after you: warriors from the Town Guards, Mages Guild mages, thieves representing the Thieves Guild, or assassins belonging to the Dark Brotherhood. Each has a 25% chance of appearing as the ambushing faction. Depending on which faction is after your employer, your attackers will say when hit: Town Guards: ""Halt!

We have learned that he is currently doing some kind of unsanctioned research over in (town), apparently oblivious to his danger. You have (time limit) days to dispose of this menace and report back to me."" Decline[edit] The Guildmagister answers: ""Perhaps you are not as loyal as I thought."" Find Baltham Greyman[edit] Head to the town the Guildmagister named and learn the location of Baltham Greyman by asking around in town. Once you know where he is, meet him and talk to him. When confronted, he will say: ""So, (Guildmagister's name) has sent another of (his/her) lackeys to bring me to heel. The old women who run the Mages Guild have no sense of adventure, take no risks, dare nothing, and learn nothing. I have never lifted a finger against them, except to repudiate their control.

Join me and we will defy them all!"" The choice is yours; either carry out your orders and kill him, or join him in his endeavors. Refuse the Offer[edit] Defenestration is not an option, you must fight the wily mage on his own terms Baltham Greyman takes the fight outside  If you decline Greyman's offer, he will attack you, shouting: ""Well then, I shall have to convince you the hard way. Defend yourself, mageling!"" If you fail to kill him quickly, eventually he will teleport outside, mocking you with: ""Perhaps we should take this outside."" Once outside, locate and engage Baltham Greyman. When hit, he will again give you the opportunity to join him: ""Stop this pointless attack, and join me instead!""

Finally, your opponent will draw the line: ""You are beginning to try my patience, but I will give you one last chance. Cease your attack, and I will let bygones be bygones."" Baltham Greyman is not lying; if you wish to change your mind and join him, this is your last chance. The sorcerer will stand and fight to the death upon your refusal. Once Greyman is dead, collect any loot from his body and report back to the Guild for your reward.

Do you remember the days when I dutifully learned at your knee, as if you had more to teach me than the stale repetition of past greatness? (Random name 1), the Archmagister (random name 2) -- in their day the Mages Guild was an institution worthy of respect.  No more.

Consider yourself warned. Your humble pupil, (Baltham Greyman) Return to the Mages Guild and deliver the letter for your reward. Reward[edit] When you report back to the Guildmagister after killing Baltham Greyman, he says: ""Very good, (player's guild title). The Mages Guild cannot survive if we do not enforce our own rules, harsh as they may seem."" If you instead agreed to let Baltham Greyman escape, the Guildmagister reads his letter and stammers: ""Why...that impertinent! I am speechless! You can now see why (Baltham Greyman) must be stopped at all costs, before (he/she) undermines everything the Guild stands for. It is unfortunate that you missed that miserable little sot, but I have no doubt that we will soon track (him/her) down again."" Regardless of how the quest ends, the Guildmagister then gives you a magic item as a reward, adding: ""I made this (magical item) myself as a token of my appreciation for your service to the Mages Guild.""

Join me and we will defy them all!"" The choice is yours; either carry out your orders and kill him, or join him in his endeavors. Refuse the Offer[edit] Defenestration is not an option, you must fight the wily mage on his own terms Baltham Greyman takes the fight outside  If you decline Greyman's offer, he will attack you, shouting: ""Well then, I shall have to convince you the hard way. Defend yourself, mageling!"" If you fail to kill him quickly, eventually he will teleport outside, mocking you with: ""Perhaps we should take this outside."" Once outside, locate and engage Baltham Greyman. When hit, he will again give you the opportunity to join him: ""Stop this pointless attack, and join me instead!"" If you (again) refuse and (again) fail to kill him, he teleports some distance away and calls out: ""Yoo-hoo, over here!"" Baltham Greyman will extend the offer and (should you refuse) teleport away again twice more before his patience runs out: Offer 3: ""Surely you are ready to concede my point. We could have such fun together!"" Taunt 3: ""Did (Guildmagister's name) forget to tell you about my skill in magicka when (he/she) was preaching about my disloyalty and insubordination?"" Offer 4: ""(Guildmagister's name) has taught you persistence, at least.  But why remain a slave to the rules and regulations of the hidebound? Join my merry band of Guild defiers!"" Taunt 4: ""Missed me again, my good Guild Drone. Why haven't your Guild masters taught you these tricks?"" Finally, your opponent will draw the line: ""You are beginning to try my patience, but I will give you one last chance. Cease your attack, and I will let bygones be bygones."" Baltham Greyman is not lying; if you wish to change your mind and join him, this is your last chance. The sorcerer will stand and fight to the death upon your refusal. Once Greyman is dead, collect any loot from his body and report back to the Guild for your reward. Join Team Renegade[edit] If you accept Baltham Greyman's offer at any time during the encounter, he will say: ""Wonderful! Just tell old (Guildmagister's name) that I was not here, but left this letter for (him/her). I must depart, but I will contact you as soon as I can cook us up a truly smashing adventure. Ta ta!"" Greyman gives you the letter and disappears to points unknown. The letter says: Dear (Guildmagister's name), So sorry I missed you.  I would love to catch up on old times with you. Do you remember the days when I dutifully learned at your knee, as if you had more to teach me than the stale repetition of past greatness? (Random name 1), the Archmagister (random name 2) -- in their day the Mages Guild was an institution worthy of respect.  No more. I cannot offer my allegiance to a Guild whose sole purpose is to quash all original thought. If you send more of your enforcers against me, I will be forced to defend myself.  Consider yourself warned. Your humble pupil, (Baltham Greyman) Return to the Mages Guild and deliver the letter for your reward. Reward[edit] When you report back to the Guildmagister after killing Baltham Greyman, he says: ""Very good, (player's guild title). The Mages Guild cannot survive if we do not enforce our own rules, harsh as they may seem."" If you instead agreed to let Baltham Greyman escape, the Guildmagister reads his letter and stammers: ""Why...that impertinent! I am speechless! You can now see why (Baltham Greyman) must be stopped at all costs, before (he/she) undermines everything the Guild stands for. It is unfortunate that you missed that miserable little sot, but I have no doubt that we will soon track (him/her) down again."" Regardless of how the quest ends, the Guildmagister then gives you a magic item as a reward, adding: ""I made this (magical item) myself as a token of my appreciation for your service to the Mages Guild."" Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] Whether you decide to kill Baltham Greyman or let him go, the quest will count as success if you return to the Guildmagister in time.

Most unusually, it is carrying an engraved card in its beak. It fixes you with one beady eye, tucks the card into your shirt, and flaps away. Open the letter. It reads: (Player's name): Greetings! I hope this note finds you well. Are you interested in a little adventure? If so, meet my messenger at (tavern) in (town). Your partner in Unsanctioned Magery, Baltham Greyman  Wonders Beyond Imagining[edit] Baltham Greyman's atronach  Meeting the messenger is optional; since the quest has not yet officially begun, there is no penalty for choosing to ignoring the invitation altogether. If you do wish to embark on this adventure, travel to the town named in the letter. This town will be always be located in the same region where you received the previous quest from the Mages Guild. This information does not appear in either the letter or your journal, however, so you must rely on memory (see bugs). Enter the tavern where the messenger awaits; as soon as you step inside, a message appears: A faint scent of brimstone greets you as you walk through the door. Is that an atronach over there? With a note pinned to its back saying, ""HIT ME""? Hit the atronach once with any weapon or your bare hands to hear: The atronach intones stonily: ""Hello (player's name). I am (atronach's name), humble servant of Baltham Greyman. he [sic] asks if you would like to explore Direnni Tower on the Isle of Balfiera with him. A magical place full of wonders beyond imagining. My master will meet you there in (time limit) days."" With that, (atronach's name) disappears in a puff of smoke. Travel to the Direnni Tower and seek out Baltham Greyman within. Finding Baltham Greyman[edit]   Kill the two skeletal warriors that attack as soon as you open the door to the main room and walk down the staircase. Destroy the pair of vampires waiting at the bottom, then climb the other staircase, killing any wraiths that attack as you ascend, until you reach the door at the top. This door is locked, so open it either by magic, lockpicking or brute force. Baltham Greyman will be waiting for you in the room beyond.  Baltham Greyman is back Once you have found him, Greyman will greet you by saying: ""(Player's first name), I'm glad you could join my little party. Listen, I'm looking for one specific thing, a (Large chest) which I believe is somewhere within Direnni Tower. You can keep anything else we find, all I want is that box. Well then, let's be on our way, shall we?"" He will accompany you on your search for the item in question, an ornate chest, within this large dungeon. Once in a while, Baltham Greyman may make amusing comments while you are fighting various undead monsters within the tower: ""Take that! and that! you moldy old thing!"" ""That's the spirit! How about a little of this, too!"" ""Bloody hell, let's get out of here! If I can just get this spell to work..."" When the mummies and zombies show up, he will use his magic on the very first creature in each contingent, but won't aid you in combat any further.  Finding the Box[edit] Location of the chest Baltham Greyman is searching for The box Read the walkthrough for the Direnni Tower to learn how to reach the huge room with the hollow truncated pyramid. The box will be on the platform extending out from above the pyramid's top.  Opening the Box[edit] Some boxes are best left unopened  When you have found the box pick it up, by clicking on it with the cursor, at which point Baltham Greyman will say: ""Ah, this is the (Large chest) I was looking for. Hmm, I was expecting there to be some kind of guardian... uh oh..."" A Fire Daedra appears and attacks as soon as you have picked up the box. Kill it or wait one in-game minute to let Baltham Greyman cast a Banish Daedra spell on the fiery monster. Exit the Direnni Tower afterwards. Once you both are outside, he will thank you for aiding him in his search, but will disappear without giving you any reward. If you pick up the box before meeting Baltham Greyman, he takes it from you and gives you a random magical item as a reward. Afterwards, he will disappear. Assuming you have also no business left in the Direnni Tower, you can exit the dungeon. Reward[edit] If you already found the box before meeting Baltham Greyman, he will say: ""(Player's first name), good to see you again! You seem to have started without me -- that chest you're carrying is exactly the thing I was looking for. You don't mind if I borrow it, do you? Thanks so much!"" He then gives you a magical item, adding: ""Here's a little something I've been working on. See how you like it. I'm off!"" If you exit Direnni Tower together, he says: ""Well then, it's been fun. Perhaps we can do this again sometime. Ta ta!"" Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] Whether you complete the quest successfully or fail to complete it within the time limit, you will always lose reputation.

A raven circles, cawing out harshly before disappearing into the west: ""No time! No time! (Tavern), (Town)!"" If you are interested, make your way to the town and tavern named in the raven's message. The town will always be located in the same region where you received the original quest from the Mages Guild. Head inside the tavern to find your old friend, Baltham Greyman, who says: ""It was good of you to come. I have a new project that I think you might be interested in. It will involve a little raid on our friends at the Mages Guild, however. What do you say?"" Accept[edit] Greyman responds: ""I knew you couldn't resist! Here's the plan. For some time now, I have been searching for the location of (item dungeon), reputedly the resting place of a hoard of magical objects, including one (magical item) that I need for my own purposes -- another story for another time. The issue at hand is that I have learned that the Mages Guild of (Guild town) has come into possession of a map to (item dungeon). I still have a few friends in the Guild, despite the official ban against me... The Guild has no idea what they have, so it is up to us to liberate the map so that it can be used to its full potential."" Decline[edit] The renegade mage pouts: ""Have it your way. I thought you and I were friends, that's all."" X Marks the Spot[edit] The dungeon map Travel with him to the town where the Mages Guild is located and enter the guildhall during the opening hours. Find the dungeon map within and grab it; your associate will exclaim: ""Yes, this is the map!"" As soon as the map is in your possession, some mages will show up to stop you from leaving. Take care of them and exit the guildhall. If this takes too long, Baltham will help out: Baltham Greyman raises his staff. ""Ladies, gentlemen, we really must be going now."" A sphere of light bursts from the staff, blinding you for an instant. Once you are outside, the renegade mage says: ""I think it would be best to separate for the time being, to let this hornet's nest calm down a bit. I have one more matter to attend to before we can enter (item dungeon) ... unless you would like to handle it for me?"" ""No""[edit] ""No matter. I will need, say, (key time limit) days to take care of this business. I will meet you back in (town), at (tavern), when I have acquired the key to (item dungeon). Good luck!"" Simply head back to the tavern where you and Baltham met to begin this quest and wait the specified time for your compatriot to show up. ""Yes""[edit] The magical key, in this case a Holy dagger  ""Very well. (Item dungeon) cannot be entered without the key, a (magical key) which I have learned is somewhere in (key dungeon). Once you get the (magical key), meet me in (tavern) in (town), say, in (key time limit) days."" You will not receive any additional reward for performing this task yourself; the only reason to do so is if you wish to do some dungeon crawling (and possibly acquire some random loot). To get the key, travel to the specified dungeon and find it within. This ""magical"" key will appear as a miscellaneous (and nominally non-magical) item; you will get a notification when you pick it up: This must be the (magical key), the key to (item dungeon). Return to the tavern and wait the specified time for you friend to show up again. Descent Into the Depths[edit] A battlemage is also after the magical item  Once either of you has found the key and Baltham Greyman has also returned to the tavern, speak to him. He exclaims: ""With this (magical key) in our possession, we are ready to brave (item dungeon). Lead on, my friend!"" The renegade mage will once again accompany you on this, the final leg of your quest to find the magical item. Read (use) the stolen dungeon map with the magical key in your inventory and the location of the dungeon will be marked on your map. Travel to this dungeon and enter it. Somewhere within lurks a battlemage, who has secretly been tracking your progress in order to get the magical item first. When hit for the first time, the battlemage will shout: ""You are too late, Baltham Greyman! It was a simple matter to follow you to (item dungeon), once you had found the (magical key) for me. The (magical item) is now mine, and mine alone!"" Since this interloper has already found the item you seek, you must fight to the death for it. Reward[edit] Once the battlemage is dead, loot the corpse to collect Greyman's item of interest, along with a few other magical items, gold, and any remaining loot. With the item in hand, exit the dungeon. Upon setting foot outside, Baltham Greyman asks for his prize, and a prompt appears: ""Well, friend (player's first name), an enjoyable little jaunt eh? I'll take the (magical item) and be on my way."" Do you give the (magical item) to Baltham Greyman? If you give Baltham Greyman the magical item, he will bid his farewell by saying: ""Until next time!"" If you refuse, Baltham will be very disappointed by your greed. He will then attempt to kill you to gain possession of his prize, growling angrily: ""So, your true colors at last. I only asked for one small thing, yet your greed apparently knows no bounds."" Defend yourself and kill him instead. Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] If you steal the dungeon map, you will lose reputation with the Mages Guild according to the table below.

Locating the Contact[edit] The spellswords are willing to attack in broad daylight on crowded streets to get your gold The noble's contact  Travel to the town where the noble's contact is waiting. You may encounter some spellswords along the way who want the gold you are carrying, and say: ""That gold bar must be quite heavy. How about I relieve you of it? Just hand it over and I'll let you go."" If you give up the gold, the spellsword mocks your cowardice: ""Such a brave little courier. I'll be sure to tell all my friends how helpful you can be to them."" If you hand the gold over, you will of course fail the quest. Fight your attackers or run away. Locate your contact by asking around town. Go to their location, deliver the gold, and be told: ""Ah, you must be the courier. Excellent, excellent. Now, take this (magical item) back to (quest giver's name) immediately, and (he/she) will reward you as promised. A pleasure doing business with you, (player's first name)!"" Bring the magical item the contact gives you back to the noble. Reward[edit] When you return with the magical item, the noble will thank you by saying: ""Excellent, (player's first name), you've returned with my (magical item) as promised.

There is apparently a fine involved for noncompliance. Frankly, I don't have the time for this; but if you wouldn't mind bloodying your sword a bit, I could use your help. The last mercenary I hired didn't make it, so I would understand if you're hesitant. I'd be happy to pay you, say, (random gold) gold pieces for your trouble."" Accept[edit] The merchant/innkeeper goes on: Would you? Marvelous. Now, the catch is that I must have proof that a serious effort has been made to clear out (dungeon) in (time limit) days.

Never could abide the stench of harpies myself."" Pluck the Feather[edit] The clan feather The mercenary is stuck in the dungeon Before setting out, keep in mind that your weapons need to be of dwarven or better make to harm harpies. Once you are ready, head to the infested dungeon and enter it. There may be many of harpies in the dungeon, but only one of them will have a clan feather on its body. After you have found and killed the wanted harpy, pick up the clan feather (which appears as just an ordinary gryphon's feather) from its body and a message pops up: You have found a clan feather. You only need this feather to complete the quest successfully. Return it to your employer for your reward. (Optional) Rescue Mission[edit] Sometime between seventeen hours to about two days after starting the quest, you will be approached: A young courier appears at your side, hands you a letter, and disappears without a word. The letter is from your employer, and reads: (Employer's building), (town) Dear (player's name), I am sorry to annoy you while I'm sure you're busy, but I received a caller from the Fighters Guild on the subject of (mercenary's name), that mercenary I first hired to clean out (dungeon). Without boring you with the details of the interview, let me tell you that I promised the Guildmaster I'd ask you to look for (mercenary's name) while you're in (dungeon).

Yours truly, (Employer's name) If you choose to mount a rescue, you will find the mercenary at the same location where you previously killed the clan harpy. This should make the task much easier, assuming you remember where this was. Another clan harpy will spawn there as well. When found, the mercenary will say: ""You're from (employer's name)? Thank (god's name) you arrived, (player's first name). Hope you don't mind if I join you. Take this (jewelry) as a sign of my gratitude."" The mercenary will now be following you. Exit the dungeon and head back to your employer. As soon as you arrive in town the mercenary will take their leave, saying: ""Thank you, (player's first name). I know my way home from here."" Give the gryphon's feather to your employer and collect your reward. You will gain a considerable amount of reputation with the Fighters Guild if you rescue the mercenary; who will also give you a piece of jewelry for your trouble. This makes the whole task of reentering the dungeon once again worth the trouble. However, if you take your time getting to the dungeon and wait around a bit before entering, you may receive the letter before you have even had a chance to enter. If so, you can kill the harpy, get the feather, and rescue the mercenary all in one go; however you must still find them within. If you don't wish to bother rescuing the mercenary, just travel back to your employer. Reward[edit] Upon receiving the feather your employer says: ""Well done, (player's first name).

I know of a case that might do the trick for you (player's name). Are you willing?"" or ""I am (quest giver's name). You aren't high in the hierarchy of (temple). I might be able to speak favorably of you if you were to find a way to cure someone I know."" Accept[edit] The quest giver goes on: ""(Cousin's name) in (town) is suffering from an unusual disease. I was about to dispatch a cleric to treat (him/her). I will delay them a day or so. If you can find a cure it would increase your favor with (temple). I can only give you (time limit) days."" Decline[edit] The quest giver answers: ""If you aren't even willing or able to do a simple healing, I surely can't recommend you to temple leaders."" A Pound of Cure[edit] The Alchemist has the cure  Travel to the mentioned town. Ask around until someone points you to the cousin's location, which may be a house or a shop. Enter the building and talk to the cousin, who says: ""I feel so weak. I don't know what is wrong with me. Have you come to help me? Yes? Do you have the cure? If so, please use it on me, so that I may heal."" With no other clues to go on, ask the locals about the cousin. Eventually, someone will tell you a rumor that a healer in another town might have a cure for the disease. When you speak to the cousin, there is a 50% chance that you will also become infected by the disease. If this happens, you may wish to get yourself cured before you go on with the quest. A visit to a local temple, a spell, or a potion can be used to cure the disease. Travel to the town where the healer, an alchemist, lives. Ask around until you know where to find their location, then speak with them. The healer says: ""Hello there. Yes, I have heard of (cousin's name) of (town) and (his/her) problem. Lunar Chills it is. Often mistaken for Gray Fever. Anyway, I do have a some Hoar Frost Root that will cure it. It can only be used once though. I'll sell it to you for 20 gold.""

Give the Daedra's heart to the alchemist. Return to the noble within the time limit and collect your reward.","Organ Donation[edit] Noble says: ""I have an acquaintance, an alchemist of some skill by the name of (alchemist's name). In order to complete a project of mine, (he/she) needs a rather rare item -- the heart of a daedra. I won't lie to you; the daedra want this heart back, and you may encounter some of them along the way. Are you willing to risk this, in reward for a generous fee?"" Accept[edit] Noble goes on: ""You will? Then good luck to you. Here is the daedra's heart. If it is not in my friend (alchemist's name)'s hands in (time limit) days, it will be too old to be used. After you have delivered it, return for your reward. Good luck and godspeed."" Decline[edit] Noble answers: ""I'm disappointed, but I can't say I don't understand. Volunteering for an assignment involving the daedra certainly requires more bravery and valor than is commonly seen in (player's race) adventurers."" Deliver the Heart[edit] The daedroth is furious - though not without reason This quest is more interesting than the usual deliveries one can make for a noble. You must deliver a Daedra's heart to an alchemist in time, but the problem is its brethren want it back. A Daedroth will pursue you on your journey to the town where the alchemist lives until you have either delivered the heart or given up. When you encounter the Daedroth, it will immediately attack: The daedra hisses, ""(player's name), you meddle in affairs beyond your ken. Yes, your name is now known to us. And we will not rest until the heart of our brother is back in our hands. Prepare to fulfill your destiny, mortal..."" If you choose to not deliver the heart, you will lose an enormous amount of reputation with the noble you got the quest from and their associated factions. If you deliver the heart to the alchemist in time, you will suffer a great deal of reputation loss with not only a random Daedra Prince, but also Oblivion and any associated Daedra Princes. Since it is very difficult to restore reputation with Oblivion or a Daedra Prince by means other than waiting for the reputation to increment back to zero, this decision is a more serious one than losing reputation with the noble. Be that as it may, the choice is yours to make. And do not forget, you need a mithril weapon or better to harm a Daedroth. To complete the quest, locate and enter the shop you were sent to. When you deliver the heart, the alchemist says: ""Oh marvelous. An outstanding aortas daedrae, with minimal decomposition. Hurry back to (quest giver's name) now, (player's first name). There's a lot on (his/her) mind, and if you're not back in (second time limit) days, (he/she) may forget you even left.""  Reward[edit] The time limit given by the alchemist may be very tight, so be prepared to travel speedily. When you return after completing delivery of the Daedra's heart, the noble will say: ""Outstanding job, (player's first name). I knew those daedralings wouldn't slow you down.

(Optional) Alternatively, find the priest(ess) in the dungeon mentioned to you. Learn about the prophet's lover and travel to their location. Meet and speak to the lover. Receive a letter or a denial from the lover. If you did not receive the lover's letter, wait for a courier to deliver a message (or two). Investigate one or both messages, and receive the lover's letter or a severed finger. Report back to the quest giver with either the lover's letter or the finger within the time limit and collect your reward.","The cleric... ...the priestess... ...the prophet... ...and her lover  A Possible Prophet[edit] Speak to a quest giver, who says: ""(Temple god) be with you, (player's guild title). You may have heard of (prophet's name). If you have not yet, you will. We are investigating (his/her) claims that (he/she) is a prophet. We are not, I think, censorious by nature, but we must ever be alert to the presence of heretical influences. Would you be available to assist in this important investigation?"" or ""It falls upon us to investigate the claims of (prophet's name) that (he/she) has seen the face and heard the words of (Temple god). Perhaps you have time to assist in this inquiry?"" Accept[edit] The quest giver goes on: Good. We have already sent one of the Temple, (priest(ess)' name) to the desacrilized (dungeon), where (prophet's name) asserts that (he/she) first witnessed the miracle. If (priest(ess)' name) needs assistance, I will send for you. In the meanwhile, I want you to find some more secular information on (prophet's name), by asking around in (his/her) hometown, (town). A loyal cleric of ours, (cleric's name) will meet you in (tavern). I want to see evidence of the true nature of (prophet's name) in no more than (time limit) days. I would leave immediately. May Great (Temple's deity) bless your enterprise, (player's guild rank). Decline[edit] The quest giver answers: ""That's a pity, (player's guild title). I hope you will find time in your busy schedule for the temple in the near future."" The Investigation[edit] There are two ways to proceed with this part of the quest; either one will lead you to the next step of your investigation. You may do both if you wish. Option I: Meet the Cleric[edit] If you wish to follow the quest giver's instructions, then travel to the prophet's hometown and meet the cleric in the specified tavern. The cleric has much to say: ""Ah hello, (player's first name). Welcome to (town). The whole town's in a buzz about that young (prophet's name). But (he/she) isn't even here -- (he/she)'s in (prophet's town) at a tavern called (prophet's tavern), working on a new tract about what this mysterious spirit of (dungeon) had to say about the moral disintegration of (temple). Here's a copy of the original tractate, so you know what this (prophet's name)'s all about. Dangerous character from what I've seen so far. I'm communicating with (lover's name), a (lover's description) in (lover's town) with whom (prophet's name) had some kind of relationship. It wouldn't be a bad idea for you to go to (lover's town) and see if you can't persuade (him/her) to talk to us. Hope all this is helpful information, (player's first name)."" Check your inventory for the religious tractate the cleric gave you, which reads: I scarcely remember my voyage to the place called (dungeon): I expect I was still partly dreaming. Deep within the stinking recesses of the profaned temple, I was met with a great fire and from the flames I heard the same voice speak: ""Welcome.""      ""Who art thou?"" I addressed the flame.      ""I am what (temple) doth proclaim to worship, but with every act and thought defile my divinity. To thee I called so that a new (temple) might be created, one led by truth and true insight, and understanding of my Being. The heathen need insight, and you shall be it.""      The God told me more that day, but while the wicked (temple) continues their policy of quashing any who dare to challenge their corrupted, contemptible theology, I must keep my tracts short. More will follow shortly hereafter. Option II: Find the Priest(ess)[edit] If, on the other hand, you feel like doing some dungeon crawling, you can seek out the priest(ess) instead of the cleric. Proceed straight to the dungeon where the prophet claims to have received these visions and find the priest(ess) within, who will say: ""(Player's first name), I thought that you were supposed to be investigating the situation in (town). Well, as long as you're here, I have something different for you to do. I've found some torn up letters, scraps really, about a (lover's description) somewhere in (lover's town) by the name of (lover's name). See if you can't find something on (him/her). I don't know if (he/she)'ll talk, but it's worth a try."" You now have enough information to find the lover, and if you spoke to the cleric, the prophet as well. However, if you seek out the prophet at this time, all you will be told is: ""How they come to persecute me. Abandon your unholy abuse, hound of (temple). I am under protection of my god ... and the (ruler's title) of (region)."" Since this is a dead end, seek out the lover for more information. Locate the Lover[edit] The prophet's bodyguard will step in if confronted Travel to the town the cleric or priest(ess) named, ask around to find the lover, and meet with them. The lover will belong to a random faction. In most cases this will be a subgroup of one of the eight Temples, a subgroup of the Mages Guild or one of the Knightly Orders. However, there is no way to tell which one it will end up being. If your reputation with this faction is at least five, the lover will say: ""(Prophet's name) would kill me if (he/she) knew I was talking to you. But I know that you couldn't be working for (him/her). Here's a letter (he/she) wrote to me about a month ago. I think it explains everything."" Check your inventory for the letter. It reads: (Lover's name), My Love, First, forgive the silence of your love. It was not another attack of brain fever. For some months now, I have been in spiritual turmoil, unfit to for any company, even for the comfort of your dulcet fellowship. My days of pain are over, but for this -- I can never see you again. My life has a higher purpose than the fulfillment of a ridiculous love affair now. No longer can I suffer the evil of (temple), the evil they did to me, and the evil they are doing to all of Tamriel. The days the prophet Marukh spoke of are on us again. I must rally the people by any and all lies, innuendo, bigotry, and threats to rise against the spiritual tyranny of (temple). Forgive me, my former love. And if you can, forget me. And if you can do neither, do not see me. If you do, I will slay you and stick candles in your eyes and twine your organs with beads for the greater glory of the gods of the universe. Filthy (lover's description), torment me no longer. (Prophet's name) The letter reveals that the prophet is obviously an impostor, which should be the evidence the Temple needs. Return with this letter to the quest giver for your reward. Alternatively, you can show the letter to the prophet, who will be furious and yell: ""(Lover's name)! False creature, deceiver! How (he/she) will pay! (Warrior's name), deal with this (player's race)!"" The prophet takes the letter from you and flees, and a warrior will show up to kill you. If your reputation with the lover's faction is lower than five, the lover will deny knowing the prophet: ""Whatever they say, I never knew that (prophet's name). Tell (cleric's name) (he/she) has the wrong (lover's description)."" You will not get the lover's letter in this event; in this case, or if the prophet took the letter from you, you must wait until the quest moves on. The Aftermath[edit] The cleric's replacement A severed finger  Two to about twenty-one days after the quest was started you will be approached: A young lad hands you a letter and scurries off. You may receive one of two letters, or both. Either letter will lead to enough evidence to satisfy the quest giver. The First Letter[edit] The first letter is addressed from the cleric's tavern. It seems something unfortunate has happened there: (Tavern) (Tavern's town) Dear (player's name), There's been a horrible accident here at (tavern), involving (cleric's name). Please come here  when you can. Yours sincerely, (Replacement's name) Meet the sender, a replacement cleric sent by the Temple, who will be at the same tavern the first cleric was staying at earlier. Speak to this successor, who will tell you the first cleric was murdered: ""(Oath), (player's first name), it was dreadful. The tavernkeep found (cleric's name) in one of the rooms, (his/her) body defiled in the most horrifying way, a grim parody of the old (temple) mortuary rites. It was (prophet's name), no doubt. This relic was found in (cleric's name)'s chest cavity. See if (lover's name) in (lover's town) recognizes it."" The replacement will give you the religious artifact which was used in the cleric's murder. If you show the artifact to the prophet's lover, it provokes shock and horror: (Religious artifact)! (Oath), that's poor (prophet's name)'s property. (Oath), I knew (he/she) was unstable, but I never thought (he/she)'d really do it. (Oath), poor (cleric's name). If I had helped (him/her), (he/she)'d still be alive today. This won't make up for what I've done by failing to act, but you will know what to do with this letter. May (random god) forgive me. The lover will now give you the letter which reveals the prophet as an impostor. Return this letter to the quest giver for your reward. If confronted with the religious artifact, the prophet will snatch it from you and say: ""Thank (random god), I was afraid I had lost that. Thank you, good (player's race)."" If the prophet takes the artifact, it will make it impossible to get the letter from the lover. Thus, you will be unable to gather the evidence to complete the quest by following this trail. The only other means of completing the quest comes if you have also received the second letter. The Second Letter[edit] The second letter you may receive reads as follows: (Temple) (Temple's town) (Player's guild rank) (player's name), (Priest(ess)' name) has failed to meet with the man to whom (he/she) was to report (his/her) findings in (dungeon). We must assume the worst. You are hereby ordered to find either (priest(ess)' name) (him/her)-self or (his/her) body in (dungeon) and report back to me. All other assignments and investigations take lower priority. (Quest giver's name) Travel to the dungeon to look for clues. Seek out the priest(ess)' earlier location, and make a grisly discovery - a severed finger: You pick up a scrap of flesh, carefully, even ritually ritualistically stripped from a (priest(ess)' description)'s hand. This was once a finger of (priest(ess)' name). Return the finger to the Temple; the quest giver will accept it as evidence and reward you. If you show the finger to the prophet, it will be taken from you amidst some amusing comments. If you are not able to procure the lover's letter after losing the finger, you will be unable to complete the quest. Reward[edit] To complete the quest successfully, you must return to the Temple with either the prophet's lover's letter or the severed finger. Hand over either and the quest giver will say: ""Well done, (player's guild title). I tremble to think what (prophet's name) might have done to our temple had (he/she) spread (his/her) profane word. (Temple god) bless you and keep you, goodly (player's race). Here, a small token of the esteem of your brethren.""

(She) hands it back and returns to (her) meditations. Once you have a chalice of blessed holy water now in your inventory, proceed to the dungeon mentioned by the quest giver and find the undead menace within.  The target creature will be a zombie, a mummy or a ghost. When you hit the undead for the first time, it will moan: ""I am (monster's name)! You may slay my material form, but I will always return to my home here in (dungeon)!"" When the undead lies at your feet and you have the blessed holy water with you, the following message pops up: ""As you sprinkle the holy water over (monster's name)'s remains, a despairing wail echoes through the dark halls of (dungeon), slowly fading into the distance."" After the undead has been destroyed for good, head back to the quest giver to complete the quest. Reward[edit] When you come back after the undead creature has been dispatched, the quest giver will say: ""Praise (temple's god), you have returned safely!

Attack her, and she will offer you a deal: ""I will fight you to the death to protect the daedric (lodestone). You should know that (master's name) is not what (he/she) seems. The (Chrysamere) is a long lost item of great power that (he/she) has never owned. (He/She) means to kill you once (he/she) has possession of the daedric (lodestone).

Despite appearances, you actually have three choices on how to proceed: Accept her offer[edit] If you agree to the Daedra Seducer's offer, she adds: ""Take this token then."" Instead of the lodestone, she will give you a pearl with which you will be able to destroy the magical illusion used by your employer's master. Decline her offer[edit] She screams: ""Prepare to die!"" The Daedra Seducer will then attack. Send her back to Oblivion and get the lodestone from her body. Beware, as a trio of daedroths will appear after her demise to exact revenge. Accept her offer, but kill her anyway[edit] Once attacked, the Daedra Seducer says: ""You have a truly devious mind. I admire that. But you should know that I am not to be trifled with. I take back my token and curse you to be mistrusted by my closest allies."" The pearl will vanish from your inventory after the Daedra Seducer is gone. In addition, three daedroths will appear and attack you.

If you chose to cooperate with the Daedra Seducer and return with her pearl, it will cast a Silence spell negating the orc's magical abilities. Additionally, the Orc Shaman will summon an orc warlord to his assistance. Kill both Orcs and loot their corpses. Reward[edit] If you delivered the pearl, you will receive following message in your mind upon the Orc Shaman's death: ""Well done, (player's name).

Now that I've heard you're alive and well, I would like the opportunity to meet with you and discuss our beloved Emperor's mission in the Iliac Bay. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Lady Magnessen, the Emperor's agent in the court of Daggerfall. My position is not so official as an ambassador. None but other agents of the Emperor know of my true affiliation. The Iliac Bay is rife with rebels against the Imperial throne, so your discretion is required. For the purpose of our meeting, I will take a room at an inn, (tavern) in (town) of Daggerfall, for a month. After that, I will no longer be available. I will expect you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely, Brisienna, Lady Magnessen Meeting the Emperor's Agent[edit] Travel to the town mentioned in the letter and locate the inn. Enter it and find Lady Brisienna among the patrons.

He will occasionally moan the word ""Vengeance,"" but that is the only coherent word I have ever heard him utter. If you are ever in Daggerfall, do not wander the city at night. You are certain to be attacked by his legion of ghosts. It would probably be more gainful to investigate those who might have wronged Lysandus to find the cause behind his torment. I do not know if the royal family of Daggerfall or another person or persons merit more suspicion. The major powers of the Bay, Sentinel, Wayrest, and Daggerfall may be good places to start."" Brisienna will also brief you on the Emperor's letter: ""In the matter of the letter, the Emperor's agent says that he was unable to hand-deliver it to the Queen because of the war. He hired a courier who supposedly delivered the letter in his stead. We do not even know the name of this courier. Obviously, there is little information of use, but it would be worthwhile to see whether the letter arrived at Castle Daggerfall at all. How you decide to do this is entirely your decision. I will contact you if any new information should surface. I am leaving Daggerfall soon. My position has [sic] here has been compromised and my life is in danger. Do not mention my name in court. It is more likely to hurt than help. Good luck, and watch your back, (player's first name)."" At this point you are on your own, free to adventure and explore at your own pace. When you meet the level requirements, the Main Quest will find you once again. Delaying the Meeting[edit] If you do not promptly meet with Lady Brisienna, she will send two additional letters urging you to do so. Delaying too long will result in reputation loss. If you do not show up after a month, you will receive a second letter with a similar invitation: (Player's name), I sent you a letter weeks ago. I only hope it caught up with you. If this one crosses your path after you have visited me on your way to see me in (town) please do not take offense. As I mentioned in the previous letter, I am the Emperor's agent in Daggerfall and it is imperative that I speak with you. I have extend [sic] my stay at (tavern) in (town) for two more weeks. Of course there is the possibility that you have intentionally snubbed me and shirked your duty to the Emperor. I hope that is not the case.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Journey_to_Aetherius","Talk to Nulfaga at Castle Shedungent and be teleported to Aetherius. Navigate through the puzzles of the Mantellan Crux. Find and retrieve the Mantella. Speak to Nulfaga again to watch history unfold as you have made it.","The Last Step[edit] This is the final quest and the end of the main storyline. After you gave the Totem of Tiber Septim to someone of royal blood, Nulfaga contacted you in a vision asking you to visit her at Castle Shedungent. Only Nulfaga can transport you to the realm of Aetherius, where the Mantella is hidden. Travel to Shedungent in the Wrothgarian Mountains, enter the castle, and meet Nulfaga in the throne room. You can enter the throne room via the shortcut, the magically locked door near the castle entrance, if you remember the passphrase (""shut up""). Speak to Nulfaga, and she says: ""Only Crowned Heads will hold the Totem True First is One Who Killed, But Did Not Kill Another Second is One Who Is Two Devoured By Its Young Third is One Who Made One Slave and Many Free Fourth and Fifth are Two Who Compete for Mud Sixth is One Who Brings a Home to the Homeless Seventh is One Who Lords All, But Does Not Lord At All I do not know who of these seven is most worthy of the Power, for too long have I let my passions make me mad. Sometimes the fate of a world hang [sic] on the decision of one person. You have choosen [sic] who will command great Numidium. You bear the burden for the consequences. I send you now to the Mantellan Crux, the safeguarded prison of the Mantella. Look for a green jewel of unusual size. Merely touch the Mantella and it is freed. You will be transported back to my side."" She will immediately send you to the Mantellan Crux. The Mantellan Crux[edit] The Mantellan Crux is a gigantic puzzle, and is inhabited by the most dangerous enemies you can possibly encounter, such as Daedra Lords, Ancient Liches and Vampire Ancients, as well as their lesser brothers-in-arms. You should come prepared, as once you have been teleported to the Mantellan Crux you cannot leave until you have found the Mantella. Make sure you have plenty of healing items, adequate weapons (at least mithril quality) and a Levitate spell or magical item with this effect. These will make the task ahead much easier. Since you will also encounter many powerful spellcasters, a Spell Reflection spell or artifact will also prove very helpful to your continued survival. The Mantellan Crux consists of six sections: The Three Floating Islands The Great Pyramid The Upturned Shrine The Blind God (The Room of Fire) Sheogorath's Crossbow The Prison of Mantella You enter the Mantellan Crux at the Three Floating Islands. The Three Floating Islands[edit] The ugly bust  Once your vision clears after being teleported, you find yourself on a floating island in the middle of nowhere. Next to you is an ugly bust, apparently of a demon. East of your current location is a Daedra Seducer standing on a path constructed of tiny floating platforms, so dispose of her if you want. Right above you is another floating island; levitate up to this island. If you haven't come with a Levitate spell of your own, touch the demon bust and it will cast Levitate on you. Once you reach the tiny island, pull the lever there and float down below the island where you entered the Mantellan Crux.   Below this island is another floating island containing four blank doors and one or two Frost Daedra. Once you have landed, dispose of the Frost Daedra and open the south door (it should make the door opening sound effect). Don't concern yourself with the other three doors; you don't need them, and the western one will even injure you very badly if you interact with it.   On the east side of this island is a small cavern, right below the surface. Levitate down and pull the lever within. Once this lever has been pulled, float back up to the middle island containing the demon bust.   If the Levitate spell wears off, touch the bust again and fly up until you are right below the ceiling of the giant room in which the islands are floating. There is an open doorway in the southwest corner; fly into it, walk a short distance to the east, then fly or climb up the shaft. Once you are up, follow the hallway until it turns north.   When you come to the four-way intersection, keep going north (the west hallway dead-ends at a room with two enemies and a treasure pile, while the east hallway leads to another room containing only a treasure pile). When you follow the hallway further north and up a ramp, you will encounter a vampire; destroy her and follow the hallway further up.   You will eventually come across a force field blocking your way to the west. Behind it is a Daedra Seducer, kill her from behind the force field since she cannot come near you. Follow the hallway further south and you will come to a lever guarded by an enemy. Kill it and pull this first lever, this will lower the force field. Go past the vanished force field and pull Lever #3. This will lower a second force field right in front of you. Pull Lever #4 and follow the hallway. Don't pull Lever #2 or it will raise a force field further down the hallway.   Continue following the hallway until it turns north.   At the end of the hallway you will encounter an enemy, often a Daedra Lord. After you have disposed of it, pull Lever #5. Backtrack all the way to the middle floating island, where you first entered the Mantellan Crux.    From the demon bust, follow the path of tiny floating platforms. Dispose of the Daedra Seducer if you haven't done this already. Below the surface of the island is a small cavern containing a Daedra Lord. If you didn't kill him when the force field was active, destroy him now. Once he is taken care of, step onto the red carpet and you will be teleported to the next section of the Mantellan Crux, the Great Pyramid.  The Great Pyramid[edit]  From the point you were teleported to from the last section, go west and through the door. You are just in front of the Great Pyramid, but you can't see it because you are looking directly at the rim of the giant rock it is constructed on. Take the elevator-platform down.    Once you have ridden the platform down, you will encounter a Gargoyle next to the platform. Kill it and proceed along the path of floating platforms. If you can levitate, this will be no big obstacle, otherwise you must be careful not to fall down. On the big center island is a graveyard and three vampires near a campfire, including a Vampire Ancient. If you approach the island, the vampires will very likely notice you. However, you can easily take them out with ranged weapons or spells; the Sleep spell of the vampires will do you no harm and the Ancient has no ranged spells. If you can levitate, fly up to the island. There are six gravestones and among them is a conspicuous white one. If you click on it, following phrase will appear: Here lies the spirit of Benefactor, though his body still guards the way. Just take note of the name ""Benefactor"" for now. If you click Gravestone #4 you will hear a groaning sound. This gravestone opens one of the trapdoors inside the Great Pyramid. Clicking Gravestone #1 will also produce a groaning sound. Once you have clicked Gravestone #1, levitate down the graveyard-island. There is a cavern in the side of the island, inside is a lever. Clicking Gravestone #1 has lowered the force field which previously blocked the entrance to this cavern. Pull the lever inside, this will open the second trapdoor at the bottom level of the pyramid. To proceed further, you must reach Elevator-Platform #3. If you can't levitate, ride Elevator-Platform #2 down. The lever is at the entrance of the island's cavern. Follow the path of floating platforms and take care of the Lich along the way. Once you have reached Elevator-Platform #3, ride it up to the very top.   The Benefactor Once at the top, you will see a lantern to the west. Touch it and it will cast a Levitate spell on you. From the lantern, fly a small distance to the northeast and enter the open doorway. Follow the hallway until you come to a room with a person resembling a Dark Brotherhood member along with two corpses. If you talk to him, he will say: ""I guard the Way. Speak only my name, and I shall grant you passage."" Type ""benefactor"" and he will be content and open the trapdoor at the very top of the Great Pyramid. Go back to the top of the pyramid and destroy the Ancient Lich guarding the entrance if you didn't already do so.  The Great Pyramid  Now that all trapdoors have been opened, fly down to the pyramid and take the first elevator down.   On the first lower level you will encounter a pair of enemies. Take care of them and ride the second elevator down.   Jump down the shaft on this level, but be careful since there is a Daedra Lord in the room.   At the bottom level of the pyramid you will encounter a Daedra Seducer near the third trapdoor. If you didn't open this last trapdoor you may get trapped inside the pyramid if you lack a Levitate spell or haven't set a Recall anchor somewhere outside. You cannot climb back up the shaft because there are no walls nearby. Jump through the open trapdoor to reach the next section of the Mantellan Crux.  The Upturned Shrine[edit]  Leave the room you were teleported to and go through the doorway. There is an elevator at the opposite side of the hallway, but more about this later.   Once again, you are in an open space. In the center is a shrine-like building under a rock dome. Follow the path down to the shrine, or alternatively step onto Platform #1 and it will take you down. However, if you step on Platform #2 it will go down to the very bottom of this section.   The blue obelisk Once you are in front of the shrine, you will notice that it is turned upside down. The south door is magically locked. To unlock it, open the east door and pull the lever inside. Then go to the west door and the crate that was previously there will be gone, revealing another lever. Pull this lever to unlock the south door. Use the tiny floating platforms to move around the shrine. Behind the north door is a Frost Daedra, but you don't need to concern yourself with it. The now open south door reveals a blue obelisk, touch it and it will teleport you to the next section of the Mantellan Crux. If you have an Open spell, you can skip pulling the levers and open the south door with your magic.    If you want to explore this section more thoroughly, you can take the elevator near the point where you started and go down. After a long ride, you will come to a hallway with a Skeletal Warrior and a Daedra Seducer. There are two doors in this hallway. One leads to a room with three treasure piles, the second leads to a catwalk below the shrine. There are two elevator platforms there. One takes you up to the shrine the other down to the very bottom of this section. At the bottom are three Sabertooth Tigers and a Fire Atronach, but nothing you should worry about. A conspicuous platform is also at the ground, north of a marble statue. If you step on the platform, it will take you up to the catwalk below the shrine where you can use the elevator platform to go up to the shrine.  The Blind God (The Room of Fire)[edit]  You will find yourself in a room with eight doors. There are some enemies behind the doors: two vampires, a Daedra Seducer, and a Harpy, take care of them. The second door to the west is a vicious trap, if you touch the door, you will be teleported into a cage in the opposite room. This cage will be lowered into a room of Orc soldiers. If the cage reaches the bottom, it will go up again. Even if you managed to kill the orcs that attack you, you cannot get out of the cage; you will be trapped inside unless you have set a Recall anchor outside or cast a Levitate spell as long as the cage is sinking down. Doing so will stop your downward movement and the cage will go down until you are outside again. The only way out of the room is through the southeast door.   Go down the hallway; a Daedra Seducer will be waiting at the first intersection. At the second intersection turn west, go through the door and right through the other door in the hallway. The room to the east is where the cage is lowered. There are three orc soldiers in the room and a fourth stands at the north doorway, some bones and body parts are scattered inside this room as well.   You enter a room containing walls of fire, several white skulls, and one giant rock skull. Four Fire Daedra are standing around a cage on the ground. Take care of them quickly before they attack you with their Fireball spells. Touch the cage and you will be teleported into the hallway in front of the Room of Fire. If you touch the first skull it will say: Hear me: The Blind God is a jealous god. Let His true servants lift up their eyes unto Him, and the Way will be easy. Hear me! The skull's words are a clue; the ""servants"" are the other small skulls in the room. You must find and touch all skulls that face the giant skull in the center, the Blind God. The first of these skulls is just near Skull #1, the skull that gave you the clue. Walk past it and up the catwalk, touch Skull #2 and it will start to rotate. Kill the Fire Atronach along the way. Walk back to the junction near Skull #1 and follow the catwalk up. Walk past two skulls (which are not visible on the screenshot) and touch the third skull you come across (Skull #3), it will also start to rotate. The other skulls in this room will also start to rotate if you touch them, but either they will do nothing, cast a harmful spell on you, or will teleport you around the area. One of the skulls creates a second force field in the eyes. Worst-case scenario, you will be teleported to the top off the Blind God but in mid-air. Without a Levitate or Slowfalling spell this might cause your death. Make your way to the top of this room; a Levitate spell will make this easy. If you walk on the catwalk, be careful as there are numerous Fire Atronachs that might knock you off.   Sheogorath in the left eye You should take the catwalk that leads past Skull #2, as it will land you just in front of the Blind God's left eye. The other catwalk (past Skull #3) leads to the right eye, but the distance from the catwalk to the eye is much greater. In the left eye of the Blind God you will find Sheogorath, in the right eye a Fire Daedra waits for you. Talk to Sheogorath if you want, he will say: ""Ah, at last! I was beginning to think you wouldn't get this far. A dreary place, don't you agree? And guarded by a pompous upstart -- he's no more a god than I am. Well, carry on. We will meet again soon, unless you are not as foolhardy as you appear.""   The Stone Skull There is an elevator platform in the giant skull; it goes up and down as you walk around. Wait for the right moment and take it down. A magically locked door at the bottom will now be open; touching Skull #3 opened it, and behind is a large stone skull. Crouch to enter the room, then touch the stone skull to hear it say: One speaks for me.Two serve me.Six protect me.How many defy me? Again, this refers to the skulls in the fire room. Only one skull faces away from the Blind God, so type ""1"". After giving the correct answer you will be teleported to the next section of the Mantellan Crux.  Sheogorath's Crossbow[edit]  You find yourself inside a small room with a magically locked door and nine skulls aligned on three shelves. Starting with the first skull on the west shelf and going clockwise, these skulls do the following when interacted with:  Produces a buzzing sound Teleports you into mid-air in front of the Blind God Produces a grunting sound Produces a groaning sound Takes a lot of your health and kills you eventually Opens the locked door Takes a lot of your health and kills you eventually Teleports you into the spiral hallway behind the locked door Teleports you on top of the Blind God Touch either Skull #6 (it's the only one with a missing jaw) or #8, or alternatively you can cast an Open spell to unlock the door. Walk through the spiral hallway and kill all the Atronachs along the way. There are eight Atronachs in total, five Iron and three Flesh Atronachs. If you teleport, you can avoid most of them. Go through the door at the end of the hallway.   Climb up the stairs and go up the hallway. You will pass three armor suits along the way and you will also encounter a humanoid foe, an Archer. Go through the door at the top of the hallway.   Behind the door waits a Knight, so kill him since you cannot bypass him. You are now in a somewhat confusing construction, but if you explore it a bit and look at it on the 3D Map, you will recognize it has the shape of a crossbow. There is apparently nothing interesting in the ""crossbow""; only an empty room. Go to the bottom of the ""crossbow"" where a pit is located. There is another Knight on the other side of the pit to kill. Afterwards, jump into the pit.   You will be teleported to a small island floating in open space. If you look up, you will see that a gigantic sword is stuck into this island. But there are more urgent matters you should attend to first; within close range of the island are five Daedra Lords, each of them aligned in a tiny balcony around the island. They will start to toss their spells at you immediately. If you don't have a Spell Reflection spell, try to find cover somewhere behind the sword and wait until they have nothing more to shoot at you. They can easily take you out or knock you off the small island, and you will probably not survive this fall. Between two of these balconies is a platform. When you step on it you will hear a voice in your head (presumably Sheogorath's): A familiar voice laughs mockingly, ""So, (player's name), come to pay your respects properly at last? You will be teleported into the empty room inside the ""crossbow"".   Sheogorath in his sitting room However, there is a secret door on the north wall of this room. Open it and follow the hallway north until you come to Sheogorath's sitting room. There are two locked doors to the west and east of the hallway. Behind each door are a suit of armor and an Archer (e.g. a Knight), but nothing interesting. If you look on the map you will see that the whole construction has the shape of a sword, with Sheogorath's room in the pommel. Talk to Sheogorath and he will say:  ""Greetings, (player's name). You dare much by intruding here. Nevertheless, I will allow you to proceed, provided you prove as perceptive as rumor reports. You may be aware that I am a master of the blade. But what is my other favored weapon? Answer correctly, then arm yourself."" Type ""crossbow"" and Sheogorath will be content. Go back again to the ""crossbow"" and jump into the pit at the bottom to be teleported to the island with the giant sword.  Note: You can go directly to Sheogorath when you enter the ""crossbow""; it is not necessary to use the platform between the two balconies at the island at first.  A box with two mysterious red objects above it Back at the island with the sword you will notice an open trapdoor, go down the ramp. Touch the left red object and the stone box will open. Touching the right object will cast a harmful spell on you. Touch the smaller box inside and it will also open, revealing a white button. Press this button and the whole island will sink down. On the way down, there will be more Daedra Lords in tiny balconies; seek cover from their spells if you don't have a Spell Reflection spell.   The island will sink down to a gigantic crossbow. Use the platforms to reach the crossbow and step into its notch. Turn around and touch the left halberd. You will be shot up to a mark and the gigantic sword will tilt over.   Use the sword as a ramp to reach a door at its pommel. Go through the door and take the elevator down to reach the final section of the Mantellan Crux.  The Prison of Mantella[edit]   This last section is pretty straightforward. Just make your way through the rooms and destroy any ghosts and Fire Daedra you come across. Every room has a small closet but there is only one door leading to the next room. Once you are in the last room, step out into the hallway.   Follow the hallway and jump or levitate over the pits; in the last pit is a Vampire Ancient, dispose of him if you like. At the end of the hallway you will reach a gateway leading into a gigantic room that houses a shrine-like building. There are no paths leading to this shrine, but the lantern at the end of the hallway will cast a Levitate spell on you if you touch it.    Make your way over to the shrine and in its center you will find the object you have come for, a green gem—the Mantella. Touch it to release the heart of Great Numidium and see how your decisions in the previous quest take effect."

The flesh of a newborn infant is boiled over the flames of burning brimstone for three and a half days until it is hard and leathery. The resultant fiber is sewn over the head of a black cat, who is kept in a cage until it has chewed through the caul or has died of suffocation.

Report back to the Guildmagister within the time limit.","Monster on the Loose[edit] Speak to the Guildmagister, who will say: ""You may call me (Guildmagister's name). Normally I can only give work to guild members. However, one of my students has a minor problem that would be embarrassing if it were to get out. I can't pay you, but if you would be willing to chase down an escaped experiment, at small risk to yourself, I would be grateful enough to speak kindly of you to other guild members."" Accept[edit] The Guildmagister goes on: ""Good. My student keeps a pet imp. These magical creatures are not very dangerous, but it could be potentially embarrassing for him. Our scrying has determined that the imp has fled to (dungeon name). Kill the thing and report back to me within (time limit) days."" Decline[edit] The Guildmagister answers: ""So, why did you ask me for work? Sometimes I really cannot understand you common adventurers."" Finding the Imp[edit] Remember that you need at least a steel weapon to harm imps, though acquiring such a weapon shouldn't be a problem. Imps are also vulnerable to Destruction magic and hand-to-hand attacks. Head to the dungeon the Guildmagister mentioned and enter it. You may encounter more than one imp at low levels, where they show up more often as random dungeon inhabitants; the target imp will likely be the only one of its kind in the entire dungeon at higher levels. However, there are also some special dungeon modules were you will always encounter an imp in a cage. These dungeon modules are a variation of the throne room, such as the one found in Privateer's Hold. At the bottom of the grand staircase, there is a room which always contains an imp in a cage. This caged imp is never your quest object. Once you have found the target creature and hit it once, a notification appears in which the imp says: ""I would rather die than go back to the Mages Guild laboratory."" However, if you kill the imp with one strike (which is very easy to do at higher levels with an advanced weapon or a powerful spell) you won't get this notification. So, if you want to be on the safe side, use only a weapon which does a minimum of damage when you encounter an imp during this quest. Once the imp is dead, report back to the Guildmagister and receive the thanks of the Mages Guild. Reward[edit] When you return after killing the imp, the Guildmagister will thank you by saying: ""What a relief. I owe you a small debt (player's name). You have improved your favor with the Mages Guild."" Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] A successfully completed quest results in a reputation gain according to the table below.

I am (friend's name). We must proceed to Sentinel at once. I can tell you no more, except that the enemies of Queen Akorithi would give much to stop us."" The friend is now following you.

I will send more money as soon as I can  raise it, as you will need to hire more  troops if we hope to defeat Queen Akorithi.  You are surely correct that going into open  battle against her is a lost cause, but I believe  that even for a coup de main against the  Castle itself, we will need more men. We can discuss this matter further in  person when I arrive at (stronghold dungeon)  in a few weeks. If you need to reach me  in the meantime, I am staying in the Palace  at (palace town). If all goes well, we may soon  have a new ally.  Once the situation here  is proceeding smoothly again, I must return  to Sentinel to pay my respects (perhaps my  ""final respects""!) to our dear Queen. Her  agents have been dogging my steps lately,  so I shall allay her suspicions by a show of  fawning subservience which she so appreciates. Keep me informed of your progress. Most sincerely, Lord K'avar, (Palace town)  Bigger Problems[edit] Ambush! But at the moment, you have a more serious problem to attend to. Namely, the three archers and pair of mages currently attacking you. Defend yourself or flee. If you have the amulet from the tavern contact on you, then five in-game minutes after the ambush begins something odd occurs: You are suddenly surrounded by a bright glow. Looking down, you see that the light is coming from the amulet (tavern contact's name) gave you. The ground seems to open beneath your feet, and darkness engulfs you. Afterward, you find yourself teleported deep within a random dungeon somewhere in the region. Make your escape by finding the dungeon's exit. Once free, you have a few choices on how to proceed. The stolen letter reveals not only Lord K'avar's current location, but also that of his stronghold; these are a local palace and a random dungeon somewhere within the current region. If you wish to confront Lord K'avar directly, he will stay at the palace for about three and a half to fourteen days, beginning the moment you accepted the quest. After that, he moves into his stronghold and must be sought there. Your other option is to continue on to Sentinel and give the letter to Queen Akorithi. The time limit for speaking to the queen depends on the distance between the town where you were given the quest and Sentinel. Either way, following the initial ambush you will be pursued by Lord K'avar archers until the quest is over. Your only respite from these attacks comes while within the dungeon you were teleported into by the amulet.  Path I: Lord K'avar[edit] Lord K'avar lurks within the Palace Lord K'avar in person  Travel to the town where Lord K'avar is staying and enter the palace. If he is present, speak to him while carrying the letter. A prompt appears asking if you want to give the letter to him. If you deliver the letter, Lord K'avar will be pleased and say: ""I seem to have misjudged you, (player's name). Perhaps we can be friends after all. Here, take this diamond for your troubles."" This ends the quest for now (see below). However, if you refuse to give him the letter, he flees: Lord K'avar looks at you intently. The color drains from his face as he realizes who you are, and before anyone can stop him he turns and bolts for the door. Lord K'avar flees to his stronghold dungeon; in order to proceed, you must seek out Queen Akorithi. If you simply arrive too late to meet Lord K'avar at the palace but you still wish to give him the letter, you must seek him out in his stronghold. This results in a standard dungeon crawl. Path II: Queen Akorithi[edit] Travel to Castle Sentinel, talk to Queen Akorithi, and say ""yes"" when prompted to deliver the letter. If Lord K'avar is still at the palace, the queen will read the letter and say: ""There can be no doubt. This is his personal seal and signature. Guards! Go to the Great Hall and seize Lord K'avar at once, and throw him in the dungeon."" You will gain reputation with Queen Akorithi and Sentinel and a random amount of gold. If Lord K'avar has already fled to his stronghold when you give the letter to Akorithi, she will offer you the task to capture him: ""Yes? What's this letter? Dear (random god), Lord K'avar is plotting against me?! Guards! Search the Castle for Lord K'avar and bring him to me at once."" Several guards run from the room. A few minutes later one returns. With a salute, he reports that Lord K'avar is nowhere to be found. Queen Akroithi turns to you: ""He must have been alerted that his treason was about to be uncovered. Most likely he  has retired to this (stronghold dungeon) he refers to in his letter. Under the circumstances, I would prefer to avoid a direct attack. You are  familiar with the area, yes? Would you perform one more service for me and bring this traitor to justice?"" ""No""[edit] The queen responds: ""Very well. I will deal with him myself."" Akorithi gives you some gold and the quest ends, for now (see below). ""Yes""[edit] The queen is pleased with your decision: ""(Player's name), you are proving most loyal to the throne of Sentinel. I will wait (time limit) days before assaulting Lord K'avar's fortress. I hereby proclaim Lord K'avar outlaw -- capture him if you can, but kill him if you must."" Stopping Lord K'avar[edit] Lord K'avar in battle  If you agree to capture Lord K'avar, travel to his stronghold in the region where you started this quest. The time limit depends on the distance from Sentinel to the stronghold. Enter the stronghold and find Lord K'avar within; he will appear as a Ranger class enemy. When you hit him for the first time, he shouts: ""Surrender and be dragged through the streets of Sentinel as a public spectacle? Never!"" If he dies, you receive the simple notification ""Lord K'avar is dead."" If you fail to kill him within five in-game minutes, he will escape with the following message: Lord K'avar throws down his weapon. Thinking he is surrendering, you pause in your attack, but instead he twists a ring on his finger. As Lord K'avar disappears in a haze of light, you faintly hear him shout, ""Tell that bitch that she hasn't seen the last of me!"" Return to Queen Akorithi after Lord K'avar is dead or on the run. Reward[edit] If Lord K'avar escaped Castle Sentinel, but you decline Queen Akorithi's request to pursue him, she says: ""You alerted me to a grave threat to the realm. Please accept my sincere thanks as well as this (random gold) gold."" When you return to Queen Akorithi after killing Lord K'avar, she says: ""So be it. Lord K'avar chose his course, and paid the consequences, thanks to you. Here is an enchanted (magical item) for your service to Sentinel."" When you return to Queen Akorithi after Lord K'avar has escaped, she says: ""(Oath)! Lord K'avar is a slippery one, indeed. Well, I will track him down eventually, never fear. Sentinel's justice will pursue him wherever he may hide. His associates have all been arrested or fled the realm, so Lord K'avar no longer poses any threat, at least. (Player's name), please accept this enchanted (magical item) for your service to Sentinel."" If you successfully deliver the letter to Lord K'avar, you will be contacted by one of his men in 31 to 93 days for another quest. If you deliver the letter to the queen while Lord K'avar is still at the palace, decline the queen's request to capture him, or if he escapes during the battle, you will be contacted by Akorithi in 31 to 93 days for another quest. Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] If you give Lord K'avar's letter to Queen Akorithi the quest will count as success, otherwise it will count as failure. A successfully completed quest results in a reputation gain according to the table below.

If you simply arrive too late to meet Lord K'avar at the palace but you still wish to give him the letter, you must seek him out in his stronghold. This results in a standard dungeon crawl. Path II: Queen Akorithi[edit] Travel to Castle Sentinel, talk to Queen Akorithi, and say ""yes"" when prompted to deliver the letter. If Lord K'avar is still at the palace, the queen will read the letter and say: ""There can be no doubt. This is his personal seal and signature. Guards! Go to the Great Hall and seize Lord K'avar at once, and throw him in the dungeon."" You will gain reputation with Queen Akorithi and Sentinel and a random amount of gold. If Lord K'avar has already fled to his stronghold when you give the letter to Akorithi, she will offer you the task to capture him: ""Yes? What's this letter? Dear (random god), Lord K'avar is plotting against me?! Guards! Search the Castle for Lord K'avar and bring him to me at once."" Several guards run from the room. A few minutes later one returns. With a salute, he reports that Lord K'avar is nowhere to be found. Queen Akroithi turns to you: ""He must have been alerted that his treason was about to be uncovered. Most likely he  has retired to this (stronghold dungeon) he refers to in his letter. Under the circumstances, I would prefer to avoid a direct attack. You are  familiar with the area, yes? Would you perform one more service for me and bring this traitor to justice?"" ""No""[edit] The queen responds: ""Very well. I will deal with him myself."" Akorithi gives you some gold and the quest ends, for now (see below). ""Yes""[edit] The queen is pleased with your decision: ""(Player's name), you are proving most loyal to the throne of Sentinel. I will wait (time limit) days before assaulting Lord K'avar's fortress. I hereby proclaim Lord K'avar outlaw -- capture him if you can, but kill him if you must."" Stopping Lord K'avar[edit] Lord K'avar in battle  If you agree to capture Lord K'avar, travel to his stronghold in the region where you started this quest. The time limit depends on the distance from Sentinel to the stronghold. Enter the stronghold and find Lord K'avar within; he will appear as a Ranger class enemy. When you hit him for the first time, he shouts: ""Surrender and be dragged through the streets of Sentinel as a public spectacle? Never!"" If he dies, you receive the simple notification ""Lord K'avar is dead."" If you fail to kill him within five in-game minutes, he will escape with the following message: Lord K'avar throws down his weapon. Thinking he is surrendering, you pause in your attack, but instead he twists a ring on his finger. As Lord K'avar disappears in a haze of light, you faintly hear him shout, ""Tell that bitch that she hasn't seen the last of me!"" Return to Queen Akorithi after Lord K'avar is dead or on the run. Reward[edit] If Lord K'avar escaped Castle Sentinel, but you decline Queen Akorithi's request to pursue him, she says: ""You alerted me to a grave threat to the realm. Please accept my sincere thanks as well as this (random gold) gold."" When you return to Queen Akorithi after killing Lord K'avar, she says: ""So be it. Lord K'avar chose his course, and paid the consequences, thanks to you. Here is an enchanted (magical item) for your service to Sentinel."" When you return to Queen Akorithi after Lord K'avar has escaped, she says: ""(Oath)! Lord K'avar is a slippery one, indeed. Well, I will track him down eventually, never fear. Sentinel's justice will pursue him wherever he may hide. His associates have all been arrested or fled the realm, so Lord K'avar no longer poses any threat, at least. (Player's name), please accept this enchanted (magical item) for your service to Sentinel."" If you successfully deliver the letter to Lord K'avar, you will be contacted by one of his men in 31 to 93 days for another quest. If you deliver the letter to the queen while Lord K'avar is still at the palace, decline the queen's request to capture him, or if he escapes during the battle, you will be contacted by Akorithi in 31 to 93 days for another quest. Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] If you give Lord K'avar's letter to Queen Akorithi the quest will count as success, otherwise it will count as failure. A successfully completed quest results in a reputation gain according to the table below. Faction/Person Reputation Gain   Fighters Guild +5   Fighter Questers +5   Associated factions +2 A failed quest results in a reputation loss according to the table below.

It reads: Dear (player's name) If you are a friend of Lord K'avar,  please meet me at (tavern) in  (first town), as soon as possible.  This is a matter of life or death! (Contact's name) On the Chopping Block[edit] The letter sender The town and tavern are located in the same region where you received the original quest from the Fighters Guild. Travel to this town and meet your contact as soon as possible. Speak to the letter sender and be told: ""(Player's name)? You were my last hope! Lord K'avar's friends and allies have all proven faithless after he was arrested by the tyrant Queen Akorithi on trumped up charges of treason. He is now locked in the dungeons of Castle Sentinel, awaiting execution. Please, if you have any regard for the man, rescue him from certain death. He often spoke of your skill and bravery. I know you will help us."" The time limit for this quest depends on the distance from the location the quest began to the City of Sentinel. The starting location is defined as the palace where Lord K'avar was staying in the previous quest. If this location is a relatively short distance from Sentinel City, you will have a tight time limit. Conversely, if it was far away, you will have more time. However, this time limit begins when the letter is delivered to you, and you must use part of that time traveling to meet its sender. If it takes you too long to reach the meeting place, it is possible that you will never make it to Sentinel City in time regardless of how fast you travel. If you don't have access to the Mages Guild's Teleporter Service there is no way you can rescue Lord K'avar before his execution is scheduled in some cases. Since this quest has no consequences for failure, you may simply accept this circumstance and try again the next time it is offered. If you have enough time to reach Sentinel City, travel there. Enter the palace and head for the throne room. Lord K'avar is held captive in a cell deep within the palace dungeons. Finding Lord K'avar[edit] In the palace dungeons you will encounter various humanoid enemies, like archers and spellswords. You may also run into some orc shamans, orc warlords and wraiths.   Starting from the throne room take the first door to the south. The door will be locked, so you should come prepared. Using force to open it is not a good idea, because there are several royal knights in the throne room that will attack you if you attempt to break open the door. Once the door is open walk south until you come to an elevator, ride up the elevator.   Once you reach the upper level follow the hallway.   Follow the apparently endless hallway further until the ambiance changes and dungeon music starts to play.   Follow the stairs down until you come to a door. Don't go through that door, but follow the hallway east, past an intersection, then turn north and head west at a second intersection. Follow the hallway north, until it makes a turn to the east.   Follow the hallway east and down, go past an open doorway than head south. Go west past a second intersection and follow the hallway until the textures of the environment change.   Follow the hallway past a door and at the first intersection go north, than head west and go up the stairs.   Once you have climbed the stairs, follow the hallway until you come to an intersection. Head east and follow the hallway until you come to a second intersection. From there head east and go up the stairs.   From the top of the stairs follow the hallway until you reach an intersection, head west there and turn north at a second intersection. Follow the hallway north and go through the door. Head east after you walked through the door and go up.   Follow the hallway until you reach an intersection and head east there. Follow the hallway and go up, you are almost there.   Follow the hallway further and you will eventually reach Lord K'avar's cell. There will be an archer in front of the door and a spellsword guarding Lord K'avar. There will also be some loot in the cell. In the room south of the cell is a torture instrument and a treasure pile you can collect.  The Rescue[edit] Lord K'avar in his cell Before you can get to Lord K'avar, you must deal with the spellcasting guard. Unfortunately, when hit, the spellsword shouts: ""Raise the alarm! Lord K'avar is escaping! (Guard's name), come quick!"" Once the alarm is raised, more spellswords will show up. Deal with them and speak to Lord K'avar, who exclaims: ""(Oath), am I glad to see you. We must get out of here before the alarm is raised. I was just plotting my escape when you showed up, but no need for that now, eh? My strong right arm, that's what I've always called you. I promise, when I am King of Sentinel, you will be there at my side, the richest lord of the kingdom! Sounds good, eh? Once we're clear of pursuit, take me to (second town). I have a friend there at (building) who will help me organize the conquest of Sentinel anew. Lead on, good (player's name), let us away!""  Escaping the Palace Dungeons[edit] Lord K'avar's friend If you don't have a recall anchor set, you must head back to the palace entrance on your own. Beware, you will be pursued by the spellswords along the way. Once you are outside, travel to the safehouse Lord K'avar told you about. The town where this hideout is located will be in the same region where you met the contact in the tavern earlier in this quest. The time limit for reaching the safehouse depends on the distance between it and Sentinel City. However this time limit is not visible to you, so make haste. Bring Lord K'avar to the hideout town in time to receive your reward from him. You will by pursued by any remaining spellswords from the palace dungeons until Lord K'avar is safe. Once you have arrived, locate the safehouse; it will be a random building in town, so ask around to find its location. Enter the building and speak with Lord K'avar's friend to complete the quest and collect your reward. Reward[edit] When you talk to the friend at the safehouse, Lord K'avar says: ""(Player's first name), you saved my life when most of my supposed friends abandoned me. I am in your debt. My resources are not what they once were, but accept this (random gold) gold as a small token of my gratitude."" Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] If you rescue Lord K'avar from the bowels of Castle Sentinel you will lose reputation as seen in the table below: Faction/Person Reputation Gain   Sentinel -20   Queen Akorithi -20   Sentinel's associated factions -10 Enemies[edit] Enemies One Spellsword guarding Lord K'avar 20x One Spellsword every two in-game minutes (50% chance) if you attack the Spellsword guarding Lord K'avar"

Travel to Castle Wayrest and find Lord K'avar within. Decide whether to capture or kill K'avar. If you capture K'avar, bring him back to Queen Akorithi in Sentinel to receive your reward. Be sure to follow the time limit.","Queen Akorithi requests your services once again.  The Traitor Escapes[edit] This quest technically begins immediately after the previous quest ends, if Lord K'avar escaped your grasp. After that, you may notice that packs of three archers appear from time to time to harass you. When the first of these archers is injured, you hear: Did you think that you could dispose of Lord K'avar so easily? A Lord of Sentinel is no one to cross lightly!"" Although they only show up about every 33 in-game hours, the archers are still very annoying. However, you can get some good loot from them, especially if you are at higher levels. Eventually, 31 to 93 days after Lord K'avar's escape, you receive a notification: A stocky knight in the livery of Sentinel stops before you and salutes. ""(Player's name)? A letter for you, personal message from Queen Akorithi herself."" Check your inventory for the letter. It reads: Dear (player's name), I regret to inform you that your noble  service to Sentinel has been undone.  Lord K'avar still has a few friends, it seems.  he [sic] has escaped from the dungeon, only days  before he was to be hanged.    I would be most grateful for your assistance  in putting this matter to rest once and for all.  Please come and see me at your earliest convenience. Your friend, Queen Akorithi of Sentinel If you wish to embark upon this quest, travel to Sentinel and speak with the queen. The time limit for meeting Akorithi depends on the distance between the quest start location and the City of Sentinel. However, there is no way you can check this time limit, so make haste. Wayrest Bound[edit] When you speak to Queen Akorithi she says to you: ""Ah, (player's name), I was hoping you would come. My spies have located the elusive Lord K'avar. He has turned up at the court of Wayrest, of all places, apparently trying to obtain support for his pathetic claim to my throne. Wayrest would not be so rash as to openly give refuge to a convicted traitor to Sentinel, but he is hiding somewhere in Castle Wayrest, and I want you to find him and bring him back. Alive if possible, but kill him if necessary. Do not let him escape again."" The time limit for finding Lord K'avar in Castle Wayrest depends on the distance between Sentinel City and Wayrest City. However, as before, you have no means to check it. Travel quickly to Wayrest City and enter the castle. Finding Lord K'avar[edit] Finding Lord K'avar within the castle can be somewhat tricky because the dungeons of Castle Wayrest have these nice red brick teleporters. But the following walkthrough should help. In the castle dungeons you will encounter mostly knights, orc shamans, wraiths and vampires.   Starting from the dining hall, take the door to the north. As soon as you open the door, the royal knights will start to attack you. One of them is right in front of you in the hallway. From the intersection go west and up the stairs. Follow the hallway until you reach a room, you will encounter an undead creature or another knight on your way.   In this room are many open coffins and corpses as well as a foe in the room to the north. On the south wall there is a red brick teleporter; go through it.   You will be teleported to some sort of armory. A foe will also be in this room. Leave this room via the teleporter near you.   You will be teleported to the northwest corner of a tiny room. In this corner there is a switch, but you may not see it. If you look directly at it, search for it using a diagonal viewing direction. Pull this switch to unlock the trapdoor to Lord K'avar's hideout deeper within the dungeons. Leave the room through the teleporter behind you.   You will find yourself in a room with a torture instrument and a foe. Leave the room through the south door, walk a few steps to the east and enter the room. There is a secret door on the east wall of this room, open it and go through the door.   Follow the orange colored passage. The stairs in this passage are rather high, you must either climb them, jump up, or use levitation to move onward. Follow the passage upwards until you come to a small intersection and a handwheel. Turning this handwheel will open the magical locked door at the end of the passage. Follow the passage further up until you reach a room.   Leave the room through the west door, cross the hallway and enter the room on the other side. Go through the red brick teleporter.   You will emerge in a fountain and a foe will be just in front of you. Walk down the stairs and at the intersection turn north. Go north until you reach a door. Enter the room and leave it through the teleporter on the south wall.   You will be teleported to yet another room, leave the room through the secret door on the south wall and go through the orange colored passage. Go through the door at the end.   Once you are in the hallway go south and through the first door to the east. There will be some foes in the room and an open trap-door. Go down the shaft; either jump or use magic.   Lord K'avar will be in the room at the bottom of the shaft.  The Final Battle[edit] Lord K'avar at last Ready for a fight Approach the traitor and speak to him. He says: ""You again! (Oath), will you give me no peace? I'll settle you this time!"" He will then transform into a ranger and will attack you. However, he is not so eager to fight. If you hit him once, he shouts: ""Stop! Don't kill me! I surrender!"" If you accept his surrender: Lord K'avar drops his weapon, and you quickly bind his hands and blindfold him to prevent any further trickery. Now to make your escape from Wayrest... If you do not, he steels for battle with: ""Then, by (random god), we can die together!"" Fight Lord K'avar to the death. When he is dead, you receive a notification: The traitor Lord K'avar is dead. No matter which option you choose, the outcome is the same. Return to Queen Akorithi for your reward.  Returning to the Entrance[edit] After you have either captured Lord K'avar or killed him you must get out of the castle dungeons. If you have no recall spell, you must do this the traditional way, which is a lot more easier than finding Lord K'avar. For the start climb up the shaft or use levitation.   Once you are out of the pit leave the room through the west door. Follow the hallway north and enter the room. There will be an undead monster in this room. Go through the teleporter.   You will be teleported to the room where you started your teleporter journey. There will be still a foe, provided you didn't kill him when you entered the room for the first time. Leave the room with the coffins through the east door.   Return to the dining room of the castle; all guards will now be in attack mode, so leave as quickly as possible to avoid unnecessary encounters.  Return to Queen Akorithi in Castle Sentinel as quickly as possible. Reward[edit] If you return to Sentinel with Lord K'avar, Queen Akorithi will say: ""Well, well, if it isn't my loyal Lord K'avar, come back to me. Did you really believe you could escape my wrath? Guards, take him downstairs and execute him immediately."" If you return to Sentinel after killing Lord K'avar, Queen Akorithi will say: ""Lord K'avar deserved death. I would have preferred to execute him publicly, as an example to others of his ilk, but I am pleased that this sordid matter is finally closed."" The queen will then add: ""(Player's name), I knew I could count on you. The friendship of the Queen of Sentinel is reward enough, but I have prepared some more tangible gifts as well."" Receive an enchanted item and a sum of gold for your efforts. Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] This quest doesn't provide any reputation.

What is an innocent child's life worth anyhow?"" Finding the Child[edit] This quest appears at first to be a simple dungeon crawl, and in its simplest form will be just that. In this case, simply travel to the dungeon named by your employer and rescue the missing youth, who will be found at a quest location within. Speaking to the child brings up a prompt: Do you take (child's name)? If no, you are unable to further interact with the child, and cannot complete the quest. If yes, the child comes with you and says one of the following: ""Hi, I'm (child's name). I'm seven years old."" ""Hi. My name is (child's name). Want to hear a joke? Okay, here it goes. (joke)."" ""My gramdaddy's richer than you."" ""Hello, I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. But if I don't talk to strangers, then there's no one to talk to. My name is (child's name)."" ""Hello, are you a (player's race)? I am too, and my name is (child's name)."" Bring the child back to your employer and collect your reward. Your contact is a member of the Fighters Guild The Fighters Guild will not take kindly to your meddling in their affairs However, sometimes the child won't be in the dungeon at all. If your reputation with the Fighters Guild is 10 or above, about seven hours after you accept the quest you will receive a note. It may be delivered on your way to the dungeon, or you may not receive it until you have already explored within if you were quick; in the latter case, you will only find an empty dungeon. The arrival of the letter brings up a message: A courier bearing the heraldry of The Fighters Guild appears at your side. He hands you a letter and hurries off. The letter can be found in your inventory. It reads: (Knight's building) (Knight's town) Dear (player's name), (Child's name) has not been kidnapped by any tribe of orcs or any such thing. In fact, (he/she) is with us, as protection against (employer's name), who is a notorious drunk. If you want to see for yourself, with your own eyes, come on over to (knight's building).

The knight reveals that the Fighters Guild has the child, and explains their actions: ""I guess you received my letter, (player's first name). That's good. I'd hate it if you, for all the best intentions, got involved in a pretty nasty situation. (Child's name) is (employer's name)'s cousin, all right, but more importantly, the (child's description) is heir to their grandparents' fortune.

You'll improve your already good reputation with The Fighters Guild if you just leave little (child's name) alone."" It is up to you how you wish to proceed from here. If you respect the knight's wishes and leave the child in the Guild's care, you will fail the quest when the time limit expires but gain a great deal of reputation with the Fighters Guild. If you still wish to return the child to your employer, head back to the start town. Ask around to locate the safehouse used by the Fighters Guild and enter it. The building may be locked, so be prepared to pick the lock or cast an Open spell. Once inside, find and speak to the child. You will receive the same yes or no prompt as above. If no, the child will remain in the house and you will be unable to interact further. This prevents you from returning with the child and will result in a failed quest once the time limit expires. Note that if the Fighters Guild is involved, then letting them keep the child is the only way to complete the quest without losing a substantial amount of reputation with the Guild. If yes, the child says one of the random phrases listed above and begins following you. Once this happens, make your escape. Stay alert, as knights may appear to try and stop you. When you hit one of these attackers, a message appears: The warrior bears the heraldry of The Fighters Guild. Regardless of what happens, you will lose reputation with the Fighters Guild, so kill the knights or run away. Once you are free, return to your employer for your reward. Reward[edit] Upon handing the child over, your employer will thank you and say: ""(Child's name), oh thank (god's name)! (Oath), my good, good (player's name), you are my savior. Here, here's your (random gold) gold pieces."" Alternatively, if you recover the child but fail to make it back to your employer before the time limit expires (not entirely unlikely, if you spent too much time searching the dungeon), the child disappears: (Child's name) runs away when you turn away from (him/her). You will not receive a reward in this case. Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] A successfully completed quest results in a reputation gain according to the table below.

Kill the giant and take the sapphire. Return it to the noble's ally within the time limit and collect your reward.","A Hidden Gem[edit] Speak to a noble, who says: ""I have a friend, a potential ally, who is in need of discreet assistance. It's a relatively simple salvage operation, one for which my friend would happily pay very handsomely and I would greatly appreciate. It will need to be accomplished very soon, within (time limit) days. I'll go into detail, if you're interested."" Accept[edit] The noble goes on: ""Excellent, I knew you'd help. Now then, my friend is (noble's ally) of (town). (He/She) has lost a gem, a sapphire, and my spies have tracked it down to (dungeon), of all places.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Lysandus%27_Revelation","Visit Medora at the Direnni Tower once she has finished preparing the Dust of Restful Death. Get the Dust of Restful Death from her. Travel to Lysandus' Tomb in Menevia and find his sarcophagus within. Use the dust to soothe the spirit of King Lysandus. Talk to Lysandus' spirit to find out what will put him to rest.","The tomb of King Lysandus Return to Medora[edit] After Medora has finished preparing the Dust of Restful Death you acquired from the mummy (this takes about 21 days), make your way once again through Direnni Tower and speak to the sorceress in her chambers. She tells you, ""The powder is ready. All you need to do is spinkle [sic] it on his true corpse. I must warn you. It will not put his shade to rest, but will soothe it sufficiently to allow you a chance to speak with him. The final exorcism is for Lysandus to choose.  I do not know where he was buried. I do know that it is not on the field of Cryngaine where they erected that monument to him. If you do speak to him...could you tell him I still love him. Death will not be a barrier to us for long."" If you return too early, Medora simply tells you, ""I thought I told you it would take a month. The powder is not ready yet. Come back later."" With the Dust of Restful Death in your possession, you can go to Lysandus' Tomb to attempt to calm his spirit. Lysandus' Tomb is located in Menevia, and its location is revealed to you after completing the Castle Llugwych quest. Head there and enter the crypt. Finding the Burial Chamber[edit]  The burial chamber is located deep inside the tomb. Ahead of you lies probably the longest route of all Main Quest dungeons. From the entrance, walk west through the hall past some interesting statues of the various foes you can come up against in the game. At the end of the hall, go through the door to your left. Follow the hallway up until you come to an intersection. At this intersection turn north and follow the hallway until you reach a door; go through it.   A Skull Teleporter Follow the hallway until you reach a floating skull. Click the skull and you will be teleported to a room with some torture instruments and an enemy, kill the enemy.   This room is also your way back in case you didn't set an anchor near the entrance. There is a secret door in the northeast corner; behind it is a low passage you can only use if you are crouching. At the end of this passage is yet another skull teleporter along with an enemy and some treasure piles. Clicking this skull will teleport you to a position only a few meters away from the first skull teleporter. To proceed farther into the tomb, leave the room through the northwest door. Follow  the hallway down and go through a room at the end.   Leave the corridor through the door and follow the hallway until you come to an intersection. Turn east and follow the hallway, jump or levitate across the pit and follow the hallway until it turns north.   Follow the hallway farther north, go through the door and turn west at the intersection, follow the hallway north until you reach a second intersection.   Turn east and go down the stairs until you come to a four-way intersection. Turn north and follow the stairs down and then up until you reach a second intersection. Go east and through the door; when you reach a third intersection, go up the stairs to the south.   Once you are at the top, head east and go through the door. Turn south at the intersection and go up the ramp leading south. Head east and walk up another ramp.   Follow the ramp farther east and turn north once you stand in front of the doorway. The doorway is hidden but will appear on the overhead map. Head farther north past an intersection, go around the corner, head east at another intersection and go through the door. You will notice that the textures of the environment have changed. Head farther east and turn north at another intersection. Once you come to the four-way intersection, head east again.   Go east and follow the hallway down through a room. Go north and follow the next hallway until it takes a turn to the east.   Until now you have encountered only vampires, wraiths and ghosts, but from this point you will encounter the more dangerous undead, namely vampire ancients and liches. A vampire ancient is just at the four-way intersection. After you take care of him, walk farther east, past the two rooms. Each room contains a lich, so either engage them or run past the rooms. Go up the stairs and head south, walk through the doorway leading east.   Walk up the ramp and head east.   Follow the hallway east up the stairs and walk past an intersection. Follow the hallway and turn south. You will encounter a vampire ancient on your way.   Follow the hallway farther south until it turns west. Go west and at the intersection go north, follow the hallway farther north.   Follow the hallway farther, you will encounter a lich on the way, until you reach an elevator, take the elevator down.    You are almost at the burial chamber; follow the hallway, but watch out since there are some small chambers along the way containing a single vampire. In the last chamber you will find an elevator, take it down and pull the lever in the room at the end of the small corridor. Ride the elevator back up and follow the hallway until you reach a door. This door leads directly into the burial chamber.   Pulling the previous lever has opened a secret door in the southeast corner of the burial chamber. Pulling the lever behind this door will lower the central platform, allowing you access to the level below where Lysandus' sarcophagus is located. There will be a couple of specters in the burial chamber, so take care of them first.   Lysandus' final resting-place The former king needs your help to complete his vengeance If you have the Dust of Restful Death with you, sprinkle it onto Lysandus' corpse and learn the truth about his death. Lysandus' ghost appears, and reveals the identity of his murderer, ""You soothed my rage. I do not seek to be placated; I seek vengeance upon he who slew me. If you'll truly lay my spirit to rest, be the instrument of my vengeance against Lord Woodborne of Wayrest."" The spirit can only be exorcised if Lord Woodborne is slain or suffers a massive reversal of fortune. Lysandus will mark Woodborne Hall on your map of Wayrest. If you haven't set an anchor near the tomb's entrance, you must return to the room with the hidden skull teleporter, as mentioned earlier, to get out of the tomb. To get out from the lower level of the burial chamber, you must click the statue to the southwest of the sarcophagus. This will rise the central platform to the first level, or lower it again to the level with the sarcophagus.  Enemies[edit] Crypt Enemies"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Lysandus%27_Revenge","Travel to Woodborne Hall. Find either Lord Woodborne or his diary in the castle. Kill Woodborne or give his diary to an appropriate person.","This quest is the last in the Lysandus series. Having successfully finished it, you have completed half of the original mission given to you by Emperor Uriel VII. Having spoken to the ghost of King Lysandus, you learned that Lord Woodborne is the one who betrayed and struck down the King of Daggerfall. If you have already completed the Emperor's Letter series of quests through Orcish Emancipation, you may be aware that Lord Woodborne is also rumored to be in possession of a certain item of interest. That item is not the object of this particular quest, however. Woodborne Hall in the Kingdom of Wayrest will be marked on your map after speaking to the king's shade. When you are ready, travel there and head inside to exact ghostly vengeance. Gaining entrance to the main part of Woodborne Hall[edit]  You start at the entrance hall of the castle. A couple of enemies will be waiting to welcome you — kill them. To proceed further, you must reach the very top of the hall. If you have a Levitate spell, you can proceed onward to the next section of the walkthrough. If you can't levitate, you must first find a way to reach the top level. This can be done by pulling four levers which construct a ramp leading up to the top. You can pull these levers at will—they don't need to be pulled in a specific order.   To find the first two levers, go south from the entrance and take the elevator up.   Jump down at the first level and go north from the elevator shaft. Follow the hallway until you reach a room with two levers. Pull the left one and the right lever will open a door to a small room containing two enemies. Go back to the elevator and take it up one level.   From the elevator, go west past an intersection and into a room at the end of the hallway. Two enemies will be in this room. After you have taken care of them, pull the lever in the next room. Go back to the entrance hall.   From the entrance, go north and take the elevator up. The elevator goes up as soon as you step on the platform.   Jump off the elevator at the first level and go west until you reach an enemy next to a torch. After the enemy is disposed, pull the torch and a secret door will open. Inside this secret room, you find another lever you must pull. Go back to the elevator and ride it up to the top.   On the top level, follow the hallway past an intersection. On the north wall of the hallway is a secret door opposite a tiny room. Open the secret door and go through. Pull the lever at the end of the corridor. Go back to the entrance hall.   Now that the ramp is constructed, follow it up to the very top of the entrance hall and enter the main dungeon.  Main Part[edit]  Once you are inside the main dungeon, go through the door at the end of the corridor. Follow the hallway and go north through a landing, then up a ramp to a second landing.   From the second landing, go north and turn east. Go through the door and walk further north.   Follow the hallway further north past a door and go through the door at the end of the hallway. Head west and go up to another landing. There you must choose whether you want to find and kill Lord Woodborne or go for his diary.  Path 1: Finding Lord Woodborne[edit]  If you want to find Lord Woodborne, go north to another landing and turn east. Follow the hallway through yet another landing until you reach an intersection. Walk past this intersection and at the second intersection turn east. Go through the door at the end.   Follow the hallway east and walk north until you come to a four-way intersection. From there, go north and up the hallway. Follow the hallway until you come to another intersection, then turn north and keep walking until the hallway takes a turn to the west.   Walk up the hallway until you reach a fork. Take the southeast fork and follow the hallway. Enter the first room to your right and you will find Lord Woodborne, who is a knight-class enemy.  Lord Woodborne Lord Woodborne looks like any other knight (sometimes even a female knight). As soon as you approach, Lord Woodborne attacks and shouts at you: ""You! You're that (player's race) (player's name). You have been a thorn in my side for a long time now. A wiser (player's race) would have let sleeping kings lie. Especially when I have gone to such great lengths to kill them. Yes (player's first name), I killed King Lysandus. And now it will be a pleasure to slay you. En garde!"" When you first attack him, he casts three spells: Spell Reflection, Shield, and Heal on himself. If you are a spellcaster, hit him with all kinds of nondestructive spells first. No matter what your skills are, don't waste a magical item or use a spell in the first attack that inflicts damage, since it will just get healed. Kill the nobleman to avenge Lysandus' death. When Lord Woodborne dies, he leaves you with these words: ""I am...done in. It is up...to...to Gothryd now. May you...rot in hell (player's name). I most...certainly shall."" Lord Woodborne is dead. After this, a video sequence plays showing Lysandus' spirit finding eternal rest at last: King Lysandus, avenged at last King Lysandus is at last able to rest; the wraiths and ghosts of his loyal soldiers vanish as his soul passes to the underworld, leaving the city of Daggerfall to the living. Backtrack to the dungeon entrance if you haven't set a Recall anchor there and seek out or await your next quest.  Path 2: Finding Lord Woodborne's Diary[edit]  If you want to get Lord Woodborne's diary, go east from the landing and through another landing. Follow the hallway down and turn east at the intersection. Go through this hallway past a secret door until you reach a normal door. Go through this door.   Follow the hallway east and watch out for enemies that are waiting in the rooms along the way. When you reach an elevator shaft, you will notice a wall blocking your way to the west. Just drop down the shaft and ride the elevator to the top. Ride it down again and the wall will be gone; however, if you go too far away from the shaft the wall will come up again. In this case you must take the elevator up and down again. Once the wall is gone, go into the room. Watch out for the two enemies there, usually a battlemage and a spellsword. Among some treasures, you will find a page of Lord Woodborne's diary. Grab it, and read it if you wish.  Orchestrating Lord Woodborne's Downfall[edit] A page of Lord Woodborne's diary The diary page reads as follows: Page 7 ...from childhood. I know that Gothryd would not refuse  his aid, but I must bide my time to ask. After all, Elysana is still heiress of Wayrest and I am her bethrothed. So it should be that when Eadwyre dies (which he is bound to do, sooner rather than later) I will be king. If it weren't for that bitch queen and her brats, I would and could be patient. Never trust a dark elf the old saying goes, for you cannot read truth in their eyes. If Barenziah has her way, Helseth will be heir and Elysana will be married off to some far- off kingdom. Morgiah is already promised to the heir of Firsthold, but they keep her around to spread the poison against Elysana, and especially, me. Barenziah doesn't trust me, this I can tell. I will deal with her just as I did with Lysandus. The fool should have agreed to support me. Gortwog and his orcs almost saved him. I'll deal with those sub-humans once I sit upon the throne of Wayrest. First it is important to solidify my power base. I can (almost certainly) rely on Gothryd to support my bid for the throne, if Helseth is made heir. I have a spy network equalling Eadwyre, Gothryd, Akorith-i, or the Emperor. Perhaps the Necromancers and the Underking's networks are more extensive, but I doubt it. The problem is raw physical power. I do not have a standing army. I need the gold to raise... This passage contains many interesting revelations: Lord Woodborne's implicit admission that he was the assassin who slew King Lysandus. Woodborne is betrothed to Princess Elysana, and is plotting against King Eadwyre, Queen Barenziah, and Prince Helseth to usurp the throne of Wayrest upon the king's death. Lysandus was allied with Gortwog and the orcs, who tried to prevent his murder. Lysandus' son, King Gothryd, is allied with Lord Woodborne. Your goal is to use this information to choose an individual to deliver the diary page to; someone who can use it against Lord Woodborne, thus sealing his fate and avenging Lysandus' death. If this is properly accomplished by giving the page to one of the right people, you will see the video sequence of the king's spirit finding rest, as seen above. Delivering the page to the wrong people will prevent Lysandus' revenge at best, at worst you will be betrayed and attacked. Backtrack to the dungeon's entrance if you haven't set a recall anchor there, and seek out someone who can finish the task. The pool of potential recipients includes most of the major nobles and powers in the Iliac Bay region. The response (and any attendant reward) you receive depends on whom you choose to give Lord Woodborne's diary to. If you give the diary to Akorithi: ""This means little to me. It is trash fit only for being burnt. Gothryd and Woodborne plotting to kill Lysandus. Really! Go away."" If you give the diary to either Medora, Mynisera, or Nulfaga: ""Lord Woodborne is the slayer of my dear Lysandus. There shall be justice, and it shall come from my hand! You would do best to stay clear of Woodborne Hall and Wayrest for some time (player's name)."" If you give the diary to either Barenziah, Eadwyre, or Helseth: ""This is atrocious! After all the affection we showered on that fool Woodborne! We nearly married that villianous [sic] swine to Elysana -- nearly handed the throne of Wayrest to a cad of the first order! Good (player's first name), it was the right thing to do to bring this to our attention. Rest assured that Lord Woodborne will be arrested and executed for his treason, his name barred from the books of honor, his acquaintances interrogated, his fortune confiscated. As a gift, please allow me to give you (random gold) gold pieces as your share of his property confiscations."" If you give the diary either to Gortwog or the King of Worms: ""This information is quite valuable (player's first name). Let me gift you with (random gold) gold for giving it to me. This will be quite handy in the coming conflict."" If you give the diary either to Aubk-i or Gothryd: ""You were completely correct to bring this to me. Otherwise it might have gotten out where it could do Lord Woodborne damage. Guards! Kill this (player's race)!"" In addition, giving the diary to Akorithi, Aubk-i, Gothryd, Gortwog or the King of Worms will NOT trigger the video sequence, as they are unwilling (or unable) to exact vengeance on Lord Woodborne. Therefore, to complete the quest you have to give it to one of these people: Barenziah, Eadwyre, Helseth, Medora, Mynisera, or Nulfaga. Rewards[edit] Depending on the person to whom you gave Lord Woodborne's diary, you will gain the following reward (see Bugs for more information): Akorithi: Nothing. Aubk-i: 5x One Spellsword every one in-game minute. Barenziah: 10,000-20,000 gold (will disappear, however, once the quest is over). Eadwyre: 10,000-20,000 gold (will disappear, however, once the quest is over). Gortwog: Should be a random amount of gold, but actually you get nothing. Gothryd: 5x One Spellsword every one in-game minute. Helseth: 10,000-20,000 gold (will disappear, however, once the quest is over). The King of Worms: Should be a random amount of gold, but actually you get nothing. Medora: Nothing. Mynisera: Nothing. Nulfaga: Nothing. Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] If you gave the diary to Akorithi, you will not gain or lose any reputation. If you gave the diary to either Medora, Mynisera or Nulfaga: Factions/Person Reputation Gain   Isle of Balfiera +25   Medora +25   Balfiera's associated factions +12   Nulfaga +25 If you gave the diary to either Barenziah, Eadwyre or Helseth: Factions/Person Reputation Gain   Wayrest +50   Eadwyre +50   Wayrest's associated factions +25 If you gave the diary to either Gortwog or the King of Worms: Factions/Person Reputation Gain   Orsinium +20   Gortwog +20   Orsinium's associated factions +10   The King of Worms +20   The Necromancers +20 If you gave the diary either to Aubk-i or Gothryd: Factions/Person Reputation Gain   Daggerfall -40   Gothryd -40   Daggerfalls's associated factions -20   Wayrest -40   Eadwyre -40   Wayrest's associated factions -20   Legal reputation in Daggerfall -50 Enemies[edit] Enemies"

Meet the noble's cousin or her child and get the name of the supposed Butcher. Confront and kill the Butcher if still in town. Choose whom you will give the Butcher's letter. Deliver the letter within the time limit and collect your reward.","Strained Relations[edit] Speak to a noble, who says: ""I am desperately trying to solidify my unsteady relations with (ally's name), but I find that my position as a strong and capable ruler is being questioned because of my inability to rein in a madman. My people call this maniac the Butcher of (region). Try as they may, my guards and constabulary are helpless against him. They have no clues to his identity whatsoever. I know you have some resources and rather untraditional [sic] contacts. Will you try and help me in this matter, for the good of all (region) -- and a substantial sum of gold?"" Accept[edit] The noble goes on: ""Thank (random god) for that anyway. I am planning on meeting with (ally's name) in (time limit) days, and if this situation is not resolved by then, my position will be compromised. Not to mention the potential riot situation developing here in (town) as the murders continue. The only other person I've unofficially hired on this is (scholar's name), a scholar in (alchemist store) who has been analyzing some of the letters I've been sent. Talk to (him/her) first, and check with his [sic] progress. And not a word of this to (ally's name), if you happen to come across (him/her) in (ally's town). I need (him/her) to believe that the situation is not out of control."" Decline[edit] The noble answers: ""Not an uncommon response. Then I have little choice, but to call on some of my less savoury contacts for help -- an option I was hoping to avoid."" Initial Investigations[edit] The scholar is hard at work  Your first objective is to meet with the scholar. He or she will be busy investigating the noble's mysterious letters in an alchemist's shop in town. When you arrive, two scenarios are possible depending on how long it took you to enter the shop, as the Butcher is also after the scholar. If you arrive before the Butcher, find and speak to the scholar, who greets you with: ""(Player's name)? I'm (scholar's name). I was just on my way to (cousin's house) to meet someone who might be able to shed some light on this situation. A distant cousin of (noble's name), a (cousin's description) named (cousin's name), has been receiving letters that (he/she) says I ought to see and compare to the ones (noble's name) received. That is all I know. Since I'm so busy here, why don't you run over to (cousin's house) and see if (cousin's name) will stop being so mysterious."" The scholar gives you a letter and sends you on your way. Your next step is to find the noble's cousin. Ask around to find the location of this residence and head inside. If enough time has passed before you enter the building, the Butcher reach the scholar before you; this happens 30 minutes to 15 hours from the moment the quest begins. In this case, you will find the scholar's battered corpse. Search around the body for clues, and you will find two letters the Butcher sent to the noble. These read: (Noble's name), the last  one was So Tasty, I eveN toke a bite. Yor  WHole family looks juicy too -- may be the  Butcher will visit  you nexxt. Butcher to make the meat tHen a  litle Moor to setle the scoor. Gracishly yors, The Butchr of (region) (Noble's name), catsh me if you CAN  Cant you find me may be Im DEAD  What do you no abut deth any how Yor freind,  The Butchr of (region) Also on the corpse (or given to you by a still-living scholar) is the letter from the noble's cousin, which provides your only hint as to where to go next. It reads: (Scholar's name), I received a letter recently which I at first  considered to be merely a sick joke and very  nearly threw out. When the Butcher killings  began, I reconsidered. With your expertise,  could you possibly look at this letter and see  if the handwriting is the same as in the letters  my cousin (noble's name) has been  receiving? (Child's name) and I will be here,  waiting for you. I would prefer not to go into  more detail in written form, as the subject is  rather embarrassing and not for discussion with  any but close friends. Yours truly, (Cousin's name) (Cousin's house) There is no more to be learned here. The next step is to meet with the cousin, so ask around in town to find her residence. Family Connections[edit] The noble's cousin has received some concerning correspondence... ...and the Butcher will make an orphan of her child if you are not swift  Again, one of two scenarios plays out once you enter the cousin's residence, depending on whether you arrive before the Butcher does. If you get to the cousin first, you will find her within. Speak to her and she will tell you: (Player's first name), I trust? (Cousin's name). I believe (scholar's name) wanted you to find me, yes? I'll be honest with you -- I wanted to speak with an old friend of the family about this incident, not, with all due respect, a mercenary. In all probability, the name of the Butcher of (region) is (Butcher's name), a poor sick cousin of the (ruler's title)'s and mine who was sent to an asylum years ago. For the sake of the family, it is essential that this be kept as quiet as possible, and that allies like (ally's name) be steered away from learning the truth. (Butcher's name) needs to be silenced before (he/she) decides to write to someone other than my cousin and me. I've already found and bribed the courier who brought me the letter, and I think I know where (Butcher's name) is living. If you're really serious about catching that maniac, (Butcher's house) is where you ought to go next."" Ask around to learn the location of this house, then head there to confront this relative who may be the Butcher. If you arrive too late, the cousin will be gone. The time frame in this case is about 15 hours to 1½ days after the quest begins. In her place, you will find her child. Speak to the child and hear: ""My big cousin (Butcher's name) came by, and (he/she) said (he/she) wanted to see my mother. I don't think she liked that, because she screamed a lot. (Butcher's name) took her away, and told me to come to (his/her) house in a little bit after he was finished visiting with my mother, but I don't want to go 'cause everyone knows (Butcher's house) is haunted."" Along with the child, you will find a note. Pick it up and read it: (Cousin's name),  Thot you'd never be geting leters from  the DEAD dind you? The (ruler's title) iz  gogning to lern all I lernd abut deth from  the PIT. Hope yor readi too start lookin  ovr yor sholder, cuz Imm BACKAND I GOT A  kniF! (Butcher's name) Ask around to find the residence the child named, then head there in search of the Butcher and the cousin. Battling the Butcher[edit] The Butcher is not afraid to leave one last victim The Butcher's house may be locked, so be prepared with some means of gaining entry. There is the possibility that the Butcher is no longer at this house, this happens about 10 minutes to one day after kidnapping the noble's cousin. If this is the case, you will find the corpse of the noble's cousin at the house and yet another letter, which reads: (Noble's name),      Em turning in m kniF, for I no you  wont never ketsh me. But I will tel you  and you alon that the MAD slasher of (current locale)  the (region) Butchr is (Butcher's name) Culdnt you guess, cusin? YOU PUT ME IN A  HOL TO ROT! A STEAMING PIT FILLD WITH  THE BLACK BODYS OV YOUR OWN KIN!!  How kn you lif with yorself knowin what you  did too yor cusins to be (ruler's title) ...  (Butcher's name) hopes too see you in  OBLIVION, (noble's name) wher I will  put you in a dark hol n you can eat yor  chilren too surviv. Sumday yor freinds  will know, yes, I hop they will. And then  they will rip you n thro you down to me,  and you will screm and screm, but not lik  me, you will be DED! Gracishly yors, (Butcher's name), The (region) Butchr Unfortunately, the Butcher has escaped. It is no longer possible to successfully complete the quest, which will end in failure once the time limit expires, though you can still get a reward (see below). If you arrive in time, however, the Butcher will be home. If the noble's cousin has been kidnapped, you will find her corpse nearby as well. The Butcher is a barbarian class enemy, and when hit for the first time shouts: ""You must run away if you want to live. I know my cousin (noble's name) ... sent ... (noble's name) ... my knife here it is nice do you like?!"" Kill the Butcher. If you loot the corpse, you will find the letter that would have been left with the cousin's body. Once you are done here, return to the noble for your promised reward. Reward[edit] Alerting the noble's ally to these events will cause a scandal  If you kill the Butcher, the noble will thank you: ""(Region) is at peace again, (player's first name), thanks to you. Here is the (random gold) gold I promised -- gladly will I give it for the end of that maniac. (random god) truly blessed us when you came to (region)."" Alternatively, you can seek out the noble's ally for a reward (if the Butcher escaped capture, this is your only option). Ask around to find the building where the ally is staying. Enter the building and deliver the Butcher's letter to hear: ""(Oath)! The Butcher of (region) is (noble's name)'s cousin? I heard that there were suspicious circumstances behind the (ruler's title)'s ascendancy. This will be investigated fully, mark my words. You are a true patriot to bring this to my attention, (player's first name). Here, please accept this (gem) as a gift for your service."" If you successfully deliver the letter to the noble's ally, you will gain reputation with the Merchants. The quest, however, will end in failure once the time limit expires.

I fear that we will have a mob situation soon, perhaps within (time limit) days or less.

Decline[edit] The Noble answers: ""Not an uncommon response. Then I have little choice, but to call on some of my less savoury contacts for help -- an option I was hoping to avoid."" Racing the Ripper[edit] The scholar works out of a local bookstore The scholar  You first objective is to head to the local bookstore where the investigator hired by the noble is examining the Ripper's letters. Ask around to determine its location and head there. If you arrive after hours, you will need to pick the lock, cast an Open spell, or otherwise force the door to gain entry. What you find inside depends on how quickly you make it to the bookstore; if you are too slow, you will find the Ripper has been there first. If you made it to the bookstore before the Ripper, simply speak to the contact and learn some things: ""Good timing, (player's first name). I was about to go out to meet someone at (prostitute's house) who might be able to shed some light on this situation. A (prostitute's description) named (prostitute's name). Quite frankly, a prostitute, but one whose name was scratched off the top of a letter (noble's name) received. Perhaps the Ripper was writing a letter to (prostitute's name), and then changed his mind. If so, (he/she) might have some idea about the Ripper's identity. It's worth a try. Why don't you go to (prostitute's house) with the letter and see?"" The Ripper arrives at the bookstore somewhere between 25 minutes to 14 hours from the moment the quest starts. If you enter the building after the Ripper has been there, you will discover the grisly corpse of your contact. Along with the body, you will find three letters; if you had not yet spoken with the investigator, these will provide the only clues on how to proceed. The first two letters are simply poorly-spelled, rambling threats (note: text appears as it does in-game): (Noble's name), the last one was So Tasty, I eveN toke a bite. Yor  WHole family looks juicy too -- may be the  Ripper will visit you nexxt. Ripping and rippng and tHen a  litle RIPPING to setle the scoor.

Yours truly, (prostitute's name) To find the prostitute, ask around in town until someone points you to her residence. Once you have this information, enter the building and meet her. The Object of Affection[edit] The prostitute has a clue to the Ripper's identity The next step is speaking with the prostitute. There are once again two possible scenarios, depending on if you reach her before the Ripper does. The time frame in this case is 2 to 24 hours after the quest starts. If the prostitute is alive, speak to her. She says: ""You work with (contact's name), do you, (player's first name)? Well, (he/she) was interested in this letter I was sent the other night. (Ripper's name) was a client of mine, with some real tetched ideas of a good time. Some real tetched ideas in general. I kinda felt sorry for him, mostly I was afraid of him so I guess I let him think I liked him. 'Course now I'm getting letters like this. I think he's [sic] very much could be the (region) Ripper. He lives at (residence) if you want to go see him for real life."" She hands you a letter from the client she spoke of. If you arrived too late to beat the Ripper, you'll find the letter on her corpse. It reads: (Prostitute's name),  You said you would be my freind [sic], but  when I saw you on the street, you  pretended you didn't see me.  You don't want to make me angry  again, do you  (Ripper's name) Confronting the Ripper[edit] The Mad Ripper is not afraid to kill again  Now that you know the Ripper's name or where he lives, ask around until someone points you to the suspect's residence and enter it. The house may be locked, so you be prepared to gain entry in some manner. Somewhere inside the house you will encounter the Ripper, a nightblade, who will attack you. Fight back, and when hit the Ripper screams at you: ""I seen you with my girlfriend! Now you and she are gonna get Ripped together since you like each other so much!"" Kill the Ripper, but be wary for as spellcasters, nightblades may employ powerful magic attacks, especial at higher levels. Once you have slain the nightblade, return to the noble to report your success and receive your reward. Reward[edit] When you report your success, the noble will by overjoyed and say: ""(Town) is at peace again, (player's first name), thanks to you. Here is the (random gold) gold I promised -- gladly will I give it for the end of that maniac. (Random god) truly blessed us when you came to (region).""

One of my finest sages, (sage's name), is examining the bodies of the victims, but (he/she) has begun getting disturbing letters and frankly fears for (his/her) life. I need someone to investigate (his/her) findings to see if (his/her) fears are justified. Will you help me in this, (player's first name)? I will offer you (random gold) gold pieces in return for the retirement of the (current locale) Slayer."" Accept[edit] The noble goes on: ""Thank (random god) for that anyway. The people of (region) are becoming anxious about the lack of progress in the official investigations. I fear that we will have a mob situation soon, perhaps in (time limit) days or less. (Sage's name) works out of (library), and I told (him/her) I'd be sending someone there soon. Watch out for yourself, (player's first name). Until this situation is resolved, remember that the (current locale) night has a knife."" Decline[edit] The noble answers: ""Not an uncommon response. Then I have little choice, but to call on some of my less savoury contacts for help -- an option I was hoping to avoid."" Stalking the Slayer[edit] The sage has been performing autopsies on the Slayer's victims Note: this quest contains numerous bugs, which effectively make it impossible to complete if certain paths are taken. First, the quest has no time limit; although a counter is present, it does not start. Thus, the quest will never end unless completed successfully. However, as long as this quest is active, there is a 15% chance nightly that the Slayer will find you. Fittingly, this creature which only hunts at night is a vampire. However, you won't know that this creature was the Slayer until you have spoken to a certain individual later in the quest. If you have encountered the vampire and destroyed it, you don't have to worry about any bugs as the quest is nearly complete. If you haven't been attacked by the vampire, you must proceed with your mission. Your first objective is to meet with the sage the noble talked about, who is found in a library in town. Two scenarios are possible, depending on how long it takes you to reach the sage. Enter the library. The sage is found near a life-size skeleton model, and is still alive if you arrive promptly. Talk to the sage and be told: ""Ah, (player's first name), my dear (player's race), I am very glad you've arrived. You have doubtless been told that I've become a bit of a hermit ever since I began receiving those letters threatening my life if I did not abandoned my investigations. Well, now I have an old colleague in town with whose assistance I may be able to solve these murders. I would like you to bring these notes to a (colleague's name), a (colleague's description) you will find at (tavern). If anything should happen to me, I want somone [sic] to be able to continue on in the investigations. That will be (colleague's name) and you, (player's first name). So don't get yourself killed out there."" The sage gives you some notes to bring to this colleague, which read: Autopsy report for (random female name): Throat torn out, apparently  with violent force (Slayer a  madman?  Check into Lobornus'  work with criminally insane in Agryn  Prison). Death instantaneous,  no sign of struggle (Slayer knew  victim?  Did not appear a threat?)  Carotid artery completely severed,  loss of blood extensive by time of  examination (remember to ask  (noble's name) to send over guards  who found body for interview). Autopsy report for (random male name): Subject shows similar pathology to  female victim. Throat torn out violently,  bruises on upper arms as if gripped by  extremely strong man (Slayer's insanity  produces superhuman strength?  Note to self:  write to Lobornus for research notes from  interesting case he reported at last year's  Conclave). Bruising indicates some time  between attack and death? (Could be unrelated  to attack?  Check on background of victim) However, you are on the clock; if you arrive at night one to nine hours after the quest begins, you will only find the sage's bloody corpse. If this is the case, search around the body to find three letters. First, a pair of threatening letters addressed to the sage, which read: (Sage's name),  Terminate your investigations of the (region) Slayer's  victims if you value your life. You are moving  blindly into an inferno.  If you continue, you will die before your  studies are finished. Consider this this a  serious warning. A Well-Wisher Dear (sage's name),  Even if you lock all your doors and extinguish  all light from (library), we  will know that you are still indulging in your  forbidden autopsies. Do not ask for us to  demonstrate our power to stop you, for we will  act but once. A Well-Wisher The third is from the sage's colleague, and reads: (Sage's name),  I would very much like to meet with you  about your fascinating mortuary studies of  the Slayer victims. As you know, I have  done similiar [sic] investigations and would be  happy to share my knowledge and experience  with a distinguished colleague. Let me know by courier how it would be  most convenient for us to meet. I am  staying at (tavern),  but perhaps you would rather meet at  (library) so I might  see the corpses in question. In either, [sic]  case I look forward to receiving your  courier and note. Yours in admiration, (Colleague's name) Digging Deeper[edit] The sage's colleague is secretly a vampire, but is not your enemy A brother of one of the victims End the threat once and for all  You now know the name and location of the sage's colleague. Since there are no other leads to follow, ask around in town to locate the tavern. Head there, enter the building, and speak to the colleague. This can play out in one of two ways, depending on if you found the sage alive. If you did, you deliver the notes to the colleague, who replies with: ""So, for all the days (sage's name) has spent with those those days with those [sic] flyblown cadavers and all (he/she) comes up with is this. (Random god), with this as a start, (sage's name) won't get an intimation of the Slayer's identity for weeks yet. Listen, (player's first name), if you want to help (noble's name), take this flower over to (sibling's name) in (sibling's building) -- (his/her) brother was (random male name), one of the Slayer's victims. This may seem like a trivial sentimentality, but it will bring you closer to finding the (current locale) Slayer than any of (sage's name)'s scientific catalyses. Trust me, (player's first name)."" The colleague gives you a red poppy to bring to the victim's sibling. However, this path of investigation is broken; while you know the name of the building where the sibling is found, you are not told which town this building is in. While every other quest location is in the noble's town, this building is assigned to a random town in the current region, which makes searching prohibitively difficult (and all but impossible if the time limit worked properly). See below for more information. Should you find the building in question, enter it and speak to the victim's sibling, who says: ""A red poppy? Oh, you must be my brother's friend, (Slayer's name), yes? I do appreciate the comforting note you sent after his death. He didn't have very many friends, and, to tell the truth, he had never mentioned your name. But I certainly thank you for the lovely flowers and the invitation to visit you at (Slayer's house). I've always admired that place, and I would like to see the inside of it. What, you're not (Slayer's name)? Oh, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me, I haven't been myself since my brother... No, I don't think I have information that might help you find that murdering devil. You know I would help you if I could. But you will find the fiend that killed my brother, won't you?"" This house will be back in the noble's town. To proceed, see the next section. If you found the sage dead, the colleague will instead say: Which letter brought you to me, (player's name)? You are probably aware that I wrote them all. After (sage's name) refused to listen to my polite warnings about investigating matters beyond mortal understanding, I invited (him/her) here as (his/her) friend. I knew (him/her), you see, years ago, before I became a vampire. We met, went back to (library) to see the bodies, and there I slew (him/her). Quite painlessly. I could tell (he/she) would never have halted his [sic] studies. More than that I cannot say, except that the Slayer is a vampire like myself, but mad from the blessing of immortality. (Slayer's name), that's the Slayer's real name and (he/she) lives at (Ripper's house). If you go there and slay (him/her), I will reward you. If you intend to continue with (sage's name)'s studies, I will have no choice but to kill you as well. That is my simple offer."" Ask the people in town where this house is located, then head there. Confronting the Slayer[edit] The vampire's house will be unlocked, so you can enter it without any difficulties. Search the house to find the vampire, then destroy it. Once the Slayer is dead, return to the colleague and then the noble for your rewards. Reward[edit] When you speak to the colleague after the vampire is dead, you hear: ""By killing (Slayer's name), you have aided both (region) and myself. For this, I give you a (jewelry). Perhaps we may meet again one day, (player's name). You have intrigued me in our brief acquaintance. May the night keep you safe."" Return to the noble and report your success. Your grateful patron says: ""(Region) is at peace again, (player's first name), thanks to you. Here is the (random gold) gold I promised -- gladly will I give it for the end of that maniac and your discretion in this matter. (Random god) truly blessed us when you came to (region).""

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:The_Mantella_Revealed","Receive some notes about the Mantella and read them.","Tales and Clues[edit] After completing the Orcish Emancipation quest, you may receive an anonymous letter if you have a high enough reputation with certain factions (you may actually receive several messages from different groups if you are really well-liked). These missives will provide some information about the Totem of Tiber Septim and Numidium, and how Tiber Septim used this gigantic brass golem to forge his empire more than four centuries ago. He or she who holds the Totem controls Numidium and with it, Tamriel's fate. Similarly, some one of these people or groups may reveal information about the Mantella. The Mantella is a massive green gem that once served as the ""heart,"" or power source, of Numidium. It cost Tiber Septim's battlemage his own ""heart"" to create it. The Totem alone is worthless; the Mantella must be placed within Numidium's body to activate it. ""Friends""[edit] The following list provides the factions that may send you a letter, along with the minimum reputation required before each faction will send you a letter: Faction/Person Reputation Required Letter   Dark Plotters 50 reputation or more Letter 1   Prince Lhotun 20 reputation or more Letter 1   Any Vampire Clan 10 reputation or more Letter 1 & Letter 2   Gortwog 25 reputation or more Letter 1   The Underking 15 reputation or more Letter 2   Queen Aubk-i 25 reputation or more Letter 2   Thieves Guild 50 reputation or more Letter 2   The King of Worms 15 reputation or more Letter 3   Princess Elysana 25 reputation or more Letter 3   Any Witch Coven 25 reputation or more Letter 3   Mages Guild 50 reputation or more Letter 3 IMPORTANT: Due to a bug, most of the factions or persons mentioned in the table above will not send you a letter, regardless how much reputation you have with them. This behavior is very likely caused by the game engine's inability to allocate reputation data correctly. Only three factions or persons will send you their letters in the end (assuming you have the required amount of reputation with them). These are shown in the table below: Faction/Person Reputation Required Letter   Gortwog 25 reputation or more Letter 1   Thieves Guild 50 reputation or more Letter 2   Mages Guild 50 reputation or more Letter 3 Letters You May Receive[edit] Letter 1 Dear (player's first name), You have probably not heard the fairy tale of Numidium, but you need to. The legend dates back to the earliest parts of the third era [sic]. Numidium was supposed to be a giant so big his hands could knock the moons from the sky. I do not recall from the stories whether Numidium was supposed to be good or bad, but the legends used to scare me as a child. The legends are, in fact, true. There was a  Numidium, and, if situations continue, he will  come again. The Totem of Tiber Septim is used to control Numidium. However, legend has it that  great Numidium lost his Mantellan heart,  whatever that is, in the final with Tiber  Septim's Battlemage. Until his heart is found, the Totem is useless. A Friend Letter 2 Dear (player's first name), Numidium was Tiber Septim's secret weapon in his bid for supreme power: a thousand foot tall automaton, a golem or an atronach of sorts powered by a gem called the Mantella. The Mantella was infused with the life orce [sic] of Tiber Septim's Imperial Battlemage, and with it, Septim crushed all who stood in his way. After the complete and total defeat of all his opponents, Septim began using Numidium to crush the neutral royal families of Tamriel so that he could enthrone only persons he knew to be loyal. His Imperial Battlemage was furious at this use of his creation, and fought to reclaim the Mantella. In the ensuing battle, both the created and the creator were vanquished: the heart they shared blown out of this reality into the netherworld they call Aetherius. Numidium's body was scattered throughout Tamriel and the Imperial Battlemage, without his life force, went into a semi-slumber in a subterranean vault. In the centuries that followed, the Emperor's elite soldiers, for generation after generation, collected the pieces of the Numidium and became known as the Blades. Tiber Septim's Imperial Battle Mage [sic] became known as the Underking, and set his forces out to find the Mantella. Be warned, therefore. Those who search for the Totem of Tiber Septim are searching for the mechanism the first Emperor of Tamriel used to control Numidium. Should Numidium return, he or she who holds the Totem will control Tamriel's fate. A Friend Letter 3 Dear (player's first name), I must tell you about the Totem of Tiber Septim, which  all covet. You must know the truth about what you are asked. The Totem was crafted by the original Imperial Battlemage of Tamriel, by orders of Tiber Septim. It is essentially a means of controlling a gargantuan creature called the Numidium. Without it, the Numidium would simply not function. The Imperial Battlemage placed a seal on the Totem so that anyone not of Septim lineage or possessing a special supernatural affinity, such as himself, would be instantly killed if they attempted to use it. The Totem, with the rest of Numidum, was lost during the epic battle between the Imperial Battlemage and his own creation. A Friend"

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Medora%27s_Freedom","Find Medora within the Direnni Tower on the Isle of Balfiera. Talk to Medora and she tells you that only a Great Unicorn's Horn from Shedungent can free her. Travel to Shedungent to find and retrieve the unicorn's horn. Return the horn to Medora.","Finding Medora[edit] You will have to go through Direnni Tower four or five times to talk to Medora in the course of the game. You will be facing a lot of undead enemies in this dungeon, including many vampires and enemies who can paralyze you, so be prepared. You can fight or you can run past them when you can. Because they're undead, invisibility won't work on them. You may choose to set a Recall anchor at the entrance to save some time.   When you enter Direnni Tower, immediately turn left and go through the door. Descend the stairs to the right, turn left and cross the room. Go up the stairs on the opposite side, starting near the trap door in the floor. On the first landing, you will see a wheel in an alcove. This wheel will move a wall near the exit, but there's another wheel elsewhere that will activate the same wall, so you don't need to mess with it now.    Instead, ignore the wheel and turn right. Follow the stairs up several flights of stairs. When you reach the second-to-last landing you'll see the third door on the stairs. Enter the door, then turn left and you'll see a hidden door along the wall. Open the hidden door, then follow the passage beyond until you go down a ramp where you will find a hole in the floor. The hole is a one story drop.   Once you enter the hole (by jumping, climbing, or levitating), turn around and you'll see another hidden stone door. Open the hidden door, then immediately turn left when you exit to find another door. Open that door and go through. Follow this curving hallway without turning down any passages until you find a lever on the wall to your left. At the lever, turn right and follow that curving hallway until you come to another door.   When you enter the door, turn left and follow that hallway to the end where you will find another door. Alternately you can go straight and follow the path outlined in blue, but it's more complicated with more turns and a higher chance for enemy encounters or taking a wrong turn.    Open that door and enter a cavernous room with six stone pillars and three wraiths. There are three hallways leading to doors. The one in the middle has ramps that go down either side before you see the door. Both ramps end in the same location so follow it down either way. When you get to the bottom of either side of the ramp, turn and go down another ramp into to the lever room.    At the bottom of the ramp, you will see a pillar on your left with levers on each side. Pull the two levers on the sides of the pillar facing the bull tapestries, but leave the other two levers alone. Go to the door where you hear the Vampire Ancient, open it and follow the maze through to another door.    From there, follow the hallway upstairs until you are facing a lich. Just past the lich on your right is the door to Medora's chamber.  Medora's Request[edit]  Medora Direnni Talk to Medora. She will say, ""Greetings (player's first name). I am Medora Direnni, former sorceress to the court of Daggerfall. Banner of the Direnni Clan I have an interest in helping you in your aim to exorcise the spirit of King Lysandus, but I can do little in my present circumstances. If you would pay a visit to a certain other sorceress, I can lift the curse on Direnni Tower. Will you do this for me, (player's first name)?"" Accept her request, and Medora replies: ""I will be in your debt, (player's first name). Nulfaga, the mother of my former Lord Lysandus is a renowned mystic, but I have heard whispers that the loss of her son has turned her mad with grief. If this is not true, she can and will help me. I need a certain rare item, the horn of a Great Unicorn to break the curse on Direnni Tower. If Nulfaga is indeed mad, you much search her castle for this horn yourself and bring it back to me. I will expect you back in (time limit) days."" Returning to the Entrance by Foot[edit] If you didn't set a Recall anchor near the entrance, you must backtrack your way to the exit by foot.  When leaving, follow the same route back to where you dropped down the hole in the secret passage. When you come to the formerly hidden open stone door leading to the hole on your right, turn left instead. Go straight ahead and around the next corner to your right and you'll see a wheel on the wall to your right. If you didn't mess with the wheel on the first landing back at the beginning, then you should see an alcove to a door ahead of you on the left wall and a stone wall ahead of you just past the alcove. (If you see the wall ahead of you but no alcove or door, then you turned the wheel on the first landing. Spin the wheel here once to watch the wall move back into its original position, which will reveal the doorway.)   Once you see the door, turn the wheel and immediately run for the doorway as the wall starts moving. You should be able to get there before the wall blocks the alcove. Enter the alcove, but don't open or go through the door. Once the wall moves past you, go back into the hall and you will find yourself at the exit. If you do find that you're not fast enough to beat the wall, you can go back to the drop down in the hidden passage and either climb or levitate up to get out the way you came in.   Finding the Unicorn's Horn[edit] Nulfaga's Castle Shedungent Travel to Shedungent in the Wrothgarian Mountains to find the unicorn's horn.  Magical locked door to the throne room  Once you enter Shedungent, walk a few steps to the north and click the Daggerfall banner beside the magical locked door. Type in shut up and the door to the throne room will open. Head north and take care of the two monsters you will encounter. Leave the throne room through the north door.   Head further north until the hallway ends, then head west up the ramp and past the intersection. When you stand in front of the door, head north.   Keep going north until the textures of the environment change. Follow the hallway until you come to an intersection. Head south and up the ramp.   Walk through the hallway until you come to an intersection. Kill the monster and walk up the ramp to the south.   The Unicorn's Horn Follow this path past the first intersection. On the wall shortly before the second intersection, there is a torch. Pull it and it will open a path leading west. Follow this new path and head north when you reach the intersection. Continue on this path until you enter a new room. Look for a secret door on the southeast wall. Open it and you will find the unicorn's horn lying just in front of you on a bed. Pick it up and take it to Medora Direnni, who is waiting for your return.  Reward[edit] Return to Medora with the unicorn horn and she will say, ""You have succeeded in a most dangerous enterprise, (player's first name), but many more such trials await you. By bringing the horn to me, you have helped me lift the curse the Queen Dowager placed on my tower. I hope I can count on you for further aid. For now, take this (magic item) as your reward."""

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Missing_Person_Case","Talk to a Merchant or an Innkeeper. Ask the two friends you are pointed to about the missing person's whereabouts. When you have found a clue follow it to the end. Return to your employer within the time limit and collect your reward.","The Vanishing[edit] Speak to a merchant or innkeeper, who says: ""My name is (employer's name). Can you help me find my friend? I can only pay you (random gold) gold."" or ""Please help me. My friend (missing person's name) is missing. I am afraid that (he/she) might have been hurt. I will pay you (random gold) gold pieces if you find (him/her)."" Accept[edit] The merchant or innkeeper goes on: ""My prayers have been answered. (Missing person's name) has not been seen for four days, and I am very worried about (him/her). (He/She) has been seen consorting with (first friend's name) and (second friend's name). You might want to start with them. If you can't find (missing person's name) within two days, you need not search any further."" Decline[edit] The merchant or innkeeper answers: ""Good day, (player's race). I will look for someone else."" ""Is no-one willing to help me?"" ""A thousand pardons. I mistook you for a heroic adventurer."" The Search[edit] You may catch the missing person's friends at home... ...or in a guildhall Some of these friends keep interesting company, like these thieves Others will be found in local businesses, sometimes together This quest has multiple possible endings, and it is your investigative skills which will lead you to the missing person. To do this, you must interview the target's friends. There are four friends total, but only one of them knows where their associate disappeared to. Seek out the two friends your employer mentioned; ask around in town until someone tells you how to find them. If they do not know the missing person's whereabouts, they will each point you to one of the other two friends. Speaking to the four friends will yield the following, assuming that individual does not know where to find the missing person: First friend: ""(Missing Person's name)? Naw. Haven't seen (him/her) for a couple of days. Try asking (third friend's name). (He/She) might know."" Second friend: ""(Oath). I haven't seen (missing person's name) since day before yesterday. You could ask (fourth friend) or (first friend). One of them might know."" Third friend: ""(First friend) told you I might know something about (missing person's name)? Afraid not. All I know is (he/she) went out drinking last night. Hope nothing bad happened to (him/her)."" Fourth friend: ""Sorry, I haven't seen (missing person's name) in a while.  I don't know why (second friend's name) would send you to me... Have you tried (first friend's name)?"" One of the four will know something, however, and the quest will proceed down one of the following paths: Hiding Out[edit] Speak to the first friend, who says: ""You're looking for (missing person's name)? Well, (he/she) is hiding in (building), but don't tell (employer's name). (Missing person's name) has sworn to never speak to (employer's name) again. Don't ask me why."" You can proceed in two ways. First, you can find the missing person yourself. Head over to the building the friend named, enter it, and speak to the target within. The missing person says: ""What are you doing here? I don't ever want to see (employer's name) again. Hey! let me go! You can't just drag me through the streets to (him/her)."" Return to your employer with your quarry, and be told: ""(Missing person's name)! I didn't expect you to actually bring (him/her) here (player's name). (Missing person's name), where have you been. I have been worried about you. (Player's first name), I'll take it from here."" Alternatively, you can skip the step of finding the missing person and head straight back to your employer, who will say: ""So, (missing person's name) is hiding, eh? I'll go get that miscreant out of (his/her) hiding place. You've been very helpful (player's name)."" In the Clink[edit] If the second friend knows something, you will be told: ""Have I seen (missing person's name) lately? Sure. The guards caught (him/her) stealing from a temple. (Employer's name) will be livid when (he/she) finds out."" Relay this information to your employer, who will be livid: ""In jail! I have to leave right away. Maybe I can bribe the magistrate."" Skipped Town[edit] The third friend may tell you: ""Did (employer's name) put you up to this? I thought so. (Oath), (he/she) had a nasty fight fight [sic] with (missing person's name) a few days ago. (Missing person's name) left town and hasn't been seen since. No, I don't know where (he/she) went."" Return to your employer, who will be sad: ""So (missing person's name) has left town. (He/she) didn't need to do that. I would have forgiven (him/her)."" Smiley[edit] Smiley the killer, and a goon  Should the fourth friend know something, you must be on guard: ""(Missing person's name)? Yeah, I know what happened to (him/her). (He/She) got killed, that's what. My friend Smiley asked (him/her) real nice for (his/her) gold, and (he/she) wouldn't hand it over [sic] You really should meet Smiley and my other friends. Get the (player's race), Smiley!"" A trio of barbarians, Smiley and two friends, will immediately enter the building and attack you. Kill them and loot their corpses. Return to your employer, who will be devastated by this turn of events: ""Dead! How can that be? I hope you made that Smiley suffer (player's name). This is a day great sorrow for me."" Reward[edit] After you have returned and received one of the above responses, your employer adds: ""Here is the (random gold) gold I promised you.""

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:The_Missing_Prince","Receive a letter from Prince Lhotun. Travel to Castle Sentinel and talk to the prince. He asks you to find out what happened to his eldest brother. Wait around Sentinel for a few days asking for rumors, and eventually receive a note from an Agent of the Underking. Meet with the Agent, who points you to a dungeon in the area. Explore the dungeon and discover a death certificate which contains the dying words of the missing prince. Choose who to give the letter to.","An Invitation[edit] Once you reach level 5, you may receive a letter from Prince Lhotun of Sentinel. It reads: (Player's name), Greetings and salutations. I hope your trip was uneventful. They say that you are keenly interested in the haunting of Daggerfall. My father and King Lysandus were somewhat close. Should you come visit me, I might be able to shed some light upon recent events involving Lysandus. Prince Lhotun, Castle Sentinel Travel to Sentinel, locate the castle in the center of the city, and enter it. Look for Prince Lhotun in the entrance hall, seated on the right. Speak to the prince and he says: ""Welcome to Sentinel, (player's first name). I guess you must have received my letter. I know some things about Lysandus and why he might be haunting Daggerfall, but before I tell you, you have to promise to do something for me first. Is that all right?"" Accept the quest, and Lhotun will say: ""You will? Thank (random god). You see, I used to to [sic] have an older brother, ten or eleven years older than me, named (prince's name). Whenever I ask what happened to him, I'm told a different story. Some say he got sick and died, some say he was kidnapped by the Underking. I want to know the truth. If you can find some proof of what really happened to him, I'll tell you all I know about King Lysandus."" Gathering Information[edit] Ask around town about the missing prince to hear some of the more popular rumors and theories regarding his death. You might also learn some interesting details of his personal life. For one thing, he was more a scholar than a warrior, a trait which used to irritate his father, King Camaron. For another, he was the only prince to never receive a public funeral. Other than these two suggestive facts, you will learn nothing useful about the prince. Making A Breakthrough[edit] An Agent of the Underking After several days, you will be approached: A thin, rail of a woman steps forward and hands you a note. She turns aside all your questions with a gaunt, expressionless face."" Check your inventory for the note. It reads: Dear (player's first name), If you are interested in learning the truth, about prince (prince's name), meet me at (tavern) in (town) of Sentinel. (unsigned) Make your way to the tavern. Go to the upper level of the rendezvous point to find your contact, who greets you with, ""(Player's name)? Shh. I would prefer that nobody sees me talking with you. It has come to our attention that the Underking is being wrongly accused of abducting prince (prince's name). Before you judge, check into (dungeon). I'll mark it on your map. Who am I? Just call me a loyal servant. Now move away before anyone gets suspicious. Go on, scram."" Finding the Evidence[edit] The last words of the Missing Prince The dungeon named by the Agent of the Underking will be either Castle Faallem or The Fortress of Fhojum (Note: as of version 0.14, Daggerfall Unity will choose only these two dungeons instead of any regional dungeon). The rest is a standard dungeon crawl. When you find a piece of parchment on the ground in the dungeon, pick it up to receive the ""Death Certificate,"" which reads: 23 Morning Star 3E 400 (Dungeon) Two days I was sealed within this crypt without food or water. I do not know whether hunger or poor health or one of the creatures who share this dank hole with me will kill me first -- I only know that I will soon be dead, and not even my bones with remain. My hope is that in the years that come, this letter will be read and the sad story of (prince's name), Prince of Sentinel will be told. I am fifteen years old at the time of this writing, and have been plagued with bad health for most of my life, to the frustration of my hearty parents. The finest healers and apothecaries in western Tamriel have labored over my every cough and fever, but while they could save my life time and time again, they could not improve my sickly constitution. In retrospect, I received little real affection from the king and queen, embarrassed as they were about begetting such a cripple as the heir of the kingdom. I cannot say I missed the love; I received much attention from the doctors, priests, and herbalists constantly at court. Certainly I was not to be the sort of warrior that King Cameron [sic] was, but one of my dearest friends, a priest of Stendarr said that I might be the first scholar-king in the history of Sentinel. My younger sister Aubk-i was the true favorite of my parents: athletic, beautiful, and charming. It is hard to think of an uncomplimentary word for her. I am resigned to my imminent death, and yet, I would like to see her once again. For six years, Aubk-i and I were the only children of Sentinel. Eight years ago, the queen had a boy child and named him Greklith, after the ancient Redguard word for Strong King. Few speak that tongue any longer, but all the scholars and nobles of Hammerfell understood. And Greklith is a strong boy indeed -- I have never so much as seen him cough. The Queen's next child, born only a year after Greklith, had an even more ominous birthname -- Lhotun. Second Boy. Perhaps had I been less sheltered, more suspicious by nature, I might have read into these nominations. Lhotun and Greklith are common enough names in our family, I reasoned. Now I know that even then, I was disinherited -- even if it was not official yet. For several months before Lhotun's birth and over three years afterward, I was in the throes of a very serious fever. The doctors despaired of me, but somehow and very, very gradually, I recovered. For the first time, and the last, I read an expression on my father, the King's face that was not indifference. It was disgust. That was a fortnight ago. Three nights ago, I was seized by men I had never seen while I was having a walk. My nursemaid stood by watching placidly as I was gagged and tied and thrown roughly into a sack. I do not know how long they rode with me, but I was eventually left here. When I finally freed myself from my bonds, I found that I was alone. My wanders have gotten me nowhere. This place is filled with undead creatures that prevent me from finding any exit. I have no hope left, but no fear either. A few regrets. Perhaps had I studied magic instead of history and science I could free myself of this place. One of my tutors told the story of the Underking, how he had placed his lifeforce in the body of a powerful being and had thus conquered all Tamriel long, long ago. Had I only had the strength of a more powerful body like that. But I did not study magic. I studied history, so I leave this letter -- not to revenge myself, but as an historic document. Reward[edit] Leave the dungeon and return to Castle Sentinel. Deliver the note to Lhotun and he will reply: ""This what [sic] I most feared. Poor (prince's name). As I promised, here's what I've heard about Lysandus. I don't know how much of this is secret, but I trust you. Lysandus was in love with his court sorceress, a noblewoman named Medora Direnni, and during the war with us, his queen found out. They say that while her husband was gone, Queen Mynisera banished Medora from the court. My sister Aubk-i is queen now, part of the treaty to insure [sic] peace, but Mynisera still resides at Castle Daggerfall as the dowager Queen mother. I don't know where Medora went, but I know she has an enormous castle somewhere on the Isle of Balfiera. But I also heard there is some kind of curse on her, and she can never leave. I don't know if that helps you, but that's all I know. Again, thank you for (prince's name)'s letter. Just knowing what happened will ease my heart somewhat. Please take this (magic item) as a token of my appreciation."" Alternatively, you can deliver the note to Queen Akorithi, Prince Greklith, or Lord Vhosek. However, giving the note to anyone but Lhotun results in quest failure, and will cause your Reputation in Sentinel to plummet. Present the note to one of these three and be met with: ""What is the meaning of this? Blackmail? Why you contemptible scoundrel. You ought to be thrashed for attempting to pass this cheap counterfeit. Poor Prince (prince's name) died of a fever many, many years ago. Why can't you let him rest in peace?"" Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] If you give the death certificate to Lhotun, the quest will count as a success and you will gain reputation according to the table below. Faction/Person Reputation Gain   Sentinel +15   Prince Lhotun +15   Associated Factions +7   The Underking and his Agents +25 If you give the death certificate to either Akorithi, Greklith, or Lord Vhosek, the quest will count as a failure and you will lose reputation according to the table below. Faction/Person Reputation Gain   Sentinel -20   Queen Akorithi -20   Associated Factions -10 (Allies/Enemies affiliations for listed factions are not considered) In addition, your Regional Reputation in Sentinel will also decrease by 20 points."

Bring the cleric back to the quest giver within the time limit.","The Missing Archaeologist[edit] Speak to the quest giver, who says: ""(Player's guild title), one of our clerics, a (cleric's description) named (cleric's name) has disappeared while on an archeological [sic] dig. Will you help us find (him/her)?"" or ""I fear that one of our noblest scholars, (cleric's name) has disappeared while investigating an old ruined temple. Will you help us find (him/her)?""

Saving the Scholar[edit] The scholarly cleric in a very precarious spot This quest is yet another standard dungeon crawl. Head to the dungeon mentioned by the quest giver and find the cleric within. Once you do, speak to the cleric and hear: ""Goodness, you gave me quite a start, young (player's race). Have I really been down here for so long? How time does fly.

I had feared the worst, to be honest."" If you find the cleric but the time limit expires before you can return to the Temple, the cleric will leave, saying: ""Ah, I know the way from here,"" (Cleric's name) totters off.

Decline[edit] The merchant or innkeeper answers: ""All right then. Just curious."" or ""Good. No offense."" On the Run[edit] The owner of the stolen gem hired some extra security This is one of the most complex quests in the game, not because of its difficulty but because of the various combinations of NPCs involved. As soon as you are done talking to your would-be employer, three things happen. First, your Regional Reputation will drop by 200 points (to a minimum of -100). Second, a warrior appears in the building and immediately attacks you. Third, about ten seconds after the conversation ends, a message appears: You notice (employer's name) sneak out of the door. Your employer will be gone for most of the duration of this quest; if they provided a service, that service will be unavailable during that time. Deal with the guard and get out of there. 25 to 50 in-game minutes, after starting the quest a notification will appear (the notification will be either of the following two): A) ""A ragged beggar boy suddenly thrusts a letter in your hands and disappears before you have a second to question him."" You will receive a letter from one or more groups, depending on your reputation with them. Faction/Person Minimum Reputation   The Necromancers +10   The Thieves Guild +10   Agents of the Underking +10 or B) If your reputation with the above factions is lower than 10, you will instead receive a letter from an anonymous ""friend"" who will direct you to a person they suspect to be the true mastermind behind the robbery. The Usual Suspects[edit] The Merchant The Noble The Priest The Thief Sometimes suspects will call for help... ...but the witness will call for the guard The messages and letter will point you to at least one of four suspects in the robbery: a merchant, a noble, a priest, and a thief. One of these four is a witness to the crime and another is the culprit, determined randomly. The letters sometimes give you the suspect's location, but these letters are often inaccurate due to an oversight in the quest (see bugs). Therefore, it is often better to search for the witness on your own. Ask the locals to tell you about any of the suspect's names you have discovered. Most of the time it will be idle gossip, but eventually someone will know where the individual can be found. You can also learn the names of the other suspects this way, asking about each suspect may reveal the names of two others. Once you know an individual's location, go and speak to them. If the suspect is not the witness, you will hear one of the following: ""You're the thief (witness' name) told everyone about! Guards!"" ""Guards! It's the (player's race) (witness' name) identified as the thief!"" ""I have nothing to say to a common jewel thief. (Witness' name) told me all about you. Guards! Guards!"" The suspect just revealed the name of the witness, and you can now ask for the witness' whereabouts if you haven't already discovered this information. The bad news is that a rogue will appear in the building and attack you. Fight or escape, and find the witness. If you try to speak to any of the other suspects at this point, they will not respond. Once you know where the suspect is located, head inside the building and locate your quarry. When spoken to, the suspect will raise the alarm and flee, saying: ""It's you! You're the one who robbed (employer's building)! Guards! Guards!"" (Witness' name) slips you a note as (he/she) flees or ""It's the (player's race) who robbed (employer's building)! Somebody help me! (Witness' name) slips you a note as (he/she) flees The witness' cries summon a knight, who attacks you. Take care of this enemy and read the note you were handed before the witness fled the scene. It reads: (Player's name),     Meet me at (witness' residence). (Witness' name) Follow up on this invitation and head over to the building named in the witness' note. The doors to this building may be locked; you will need some means to gain entrance if they are. Once you are inside, talk to the witness and you will learn the true culprit's identity, along with other important information. The witness' response depends on which suspect is the culprit: If the culprit is the merchant: ""Thank (random god) you got my note. I'm sorry about calling the guard, but I couldn't be seen talking to you. Listen, I can't talk long, but I know now that you didn't do it. I told the truth when I said I saw a (player's race) like you stealing the (gem) at (employer's building), but then I saw something else. There's this (merchant's description) named (merchant's name) who, I guess, found out that you were in town and hired someone who looks a lot like you to steal the (gem) and hide it away. If you want to clear your name, get the gem out of (dungeon), where (merchant's name) has it stashed, or see if you can find any other evidence in (culprit's residence), where (merchant's name) hangs out. Now, I gotta go. Good luck."" ""You got my note, I see. Listen, (player's first name), I know that you didn't burgle (employer's building), but you have to understand that my life won't be worth a silver if they see us talking. I work for (merchant's name), which may not mean anything to you, but believe you me, (he/she) practically runs (merchant's town). If you want to clear your name and implicate my boss, you're going to have to get some hard evidence. If I were you, I'd either leave the region, or look for something on (him/her) at (culprit's residence), (his/her) house in town, or (dungeon), (his/her) secret treasure trove. Now, I gotta go. You never saw me, (player's first name)."" If the culprit is the noble: ""Listen, you gotta believe me. I really saw a (player's race) like you take the (gem), and I thought it was you. But that's before I saw (noble's name)'s cousin in (noble's town). That kid looks almost exactly like you, and I happen to know that (noble's name) sent (his/her) cousin to (dungeon) just recently. It'd be a great place to stash a (gem). The only other good choice would be (culprit's residence), where (noble's name) stays at night. As soon as I saw that cousin, I knew you were innocent. But you're going to have to get the evidence yourself. I have to go now. Good luck, friend."" ""Listen and listen carefully, (player's first name). This is what happened. I witnessed the burglary at (employer's building), but I knew that if I told the truth about who really did it, no one would believe me and I'd probably get hanged for treason. So, I told everyone a stranger did it. Specifically, you. The real burglar is someone beyond suspicion -- (noble's name) of the royal house of (region). You're going to need some evidence to prove it and I'm not going to stick my neck out anymore. The only other thing I can tell you is that, during the weekends, (noble's name) spends (his/her) time at (dungeon) and at night, at (culprit's residence). Hope you can find some evidence in one of those places. Good luck and I'm sorry."" If the culprit is the priest: ""I wasn't lying when I said I saw someone who looked like you steal that (gem) from (employer's building). Then I saw that (player's race) again at (priest's building), talking to (priest's name), one of the priests there. I overheard the two of them say something about (dungeon), and I then followed that (player's race) down to (culprit's house). From there, the (player's race) went to (dungeon). A few minutes later, you came into my tavern. No one will believe your and my word against (priest's name). You're going to have to find some evidence, either at (dungeon) or (culprit's house) to clear your name. Now, I must go. Good luck."" ""Hi, (player's first name). I couldn't talk to you at the tavern -- it was too public. I really was a witness at the burglary at (employer's building). In fact, I did it. But the one who paid me to do it and the one who said I should blame a stranger for it was (priest's name), a priest of (temple). Obviously, no one's going to believe you if you just come out and say it. You're going to need evidence. I can tell you that I stashed the (gem) in a place called (dungeon), but just getting the gem back isn't going to convince anyone. Check out (culprit's house) -- (priest's name) spends a lot of time there at night. Maybe you can find something on (him/her) there. Now, I have to go. I'll deny all of this conversation, but right now, I'll wish you good luck."" If the culprit is the thief: ""I guess you got my note. I'm really sorry all this happened, (player's first name), but I really did see someone who looked exactly like you steal the (gem) from (employer's building). The person who did it was a master of disguise -- a master thief named (thief's name). Shortly after the burglary, I was walking past (culprit's house) when I heard a voice which I recognized as the thief's, saying something about a stash in (dungeon). When I saw who was speaking, I recognized the renowned (thief's name). These days (he/she) is a respectable member of the community and it will take evidence to convict (him/her). I can't help you there, but I imagine what you need is in (culprit's residence) and (dungeon). Good luck."" ""No, I know you didn't do it, (player's first name). It was a (thief's description) by the name of (thief's name). Most people in (thief's town) know (he/she) used to be a thief, but they all think (he/she)'s retired to a life of public service. I can tell you (he/she) hasn't. You see, (he/she) picks a stranger in town to blame all (his/her) burglaries on so (he/she) remains above reproach. I'd love to see (him/her) caught, but you're going to need some hard evidence. Most nights (he/she) stays at a place called (culprit's residence), so I'd look either there or (his/her) old hideout, (dungeon). Watch yourself, (player's first name), and good luck."" In each case, you are told of a dungeon where the gem is located and a building in town which will contain exonerating evidence. You must obtain both to complete the quest, though the order does not matter. The Evidence[edit] To clear your name you need to find something incriminating on the culprit... ...and also find the stolen gem  Ask around to locate the culprit's residence. Gain entry to the building where the evidence is located from 02:01 to 23:59. Inside you will find an incriminating letter. Pick it up and a message pops up: This does seem to be some incriminating evidence. Now you must consider to whom you'll give this letter. The letter mentions the true culprit's plan, and names one of the other suspects as the culprit's adversary. Ask around town to find their location if you don't already have it. Once you have learned which town and building to go to, travel there and speak to the adversary with the culprit's letter, and (depending on who the culprit is) be told: ""(Noble's name) was behind that burglary? Well, well, well. Here's what you need to do. I'll talk to (his/her) family -- they'll be eager to diffuse this situation as cleanly as possible. You get the (gem) to (employer's name) in (employer's building), so (he/she)'s happy. What an amateur burglar that (noble's name) is."" ""So (thief's name) was behind the burglary that nearly ruined my business, eh? And now (he/she)'s trying to frame you. Well, I'll speak to the authorities and this friend of (his/hers). All I need from you is that (gem). Bring it to (employer's name) in (employer's building) and that'll not only clear you, but improve your reputation with (him/her)."" ""Blessed (random god), this is no forgery! The writer is correct. (Merchant's name) has reason to fear me. (Temple) will see to it that (merchant's name) is brought to the proper authorities, but we must see to it that you are not considered to be any kind of accomplice. If you get the (gem) and bring it to (employer's name), we can be assured of (his/her) goodwill, which we need. Hurry to (employer's building) with that (gem), (player's first name). ""You got this out of (priest's name)'s cell in (culprit's residence)? (Oath), it's priceless! Quickly, now, (player's first name), get that (gem) to (employer's name) and I'll make spread the word around that the true thief of (employer's building) is a priest of (temple)!"" The next step is to travel to the dungeon the witness directed you to and find the gem within. When you have found it, a message appears: You have found the (gem) that was stolen from (employer's building). Head back to the quest giver with all the evidence for your reward. Reward[edit] When you return the gem to the merchant or innkeeper, you will be told: ""So, it wasn't you who stole my (gem) at all. (Oath), I feel ashamed for wrongly accusing you. Here, please accept this (jewelry) as my apology. I'll make certain that the (town) guards know that you're an innocent (player's race)."" You know in your heart that even if (employer's name) speaks on your behalf, your reputation will never be the same. If the time limit runs out, however, you will not get a reward and your reputation will remain at -100. You will get a message: After all this time, there is nothing you can do easily to salvage your reputation in (town). You would be best to give the place a wide berth for some time. Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] Your regional reputation for the province you undertake the quest in will be affected by your actions in this quest according to the following table: Action Reputation Gain   Accepting the quest -200   Completing the quest +110 A successfully completed quest results in a reputation gain according to the table below.

Any emperor should not be so careless, nor should a queen. You really should come visit me in Castle Wayrest. I have some most interesting tidbits that I am sure you would enjoy hearing. -- Morgiah Princess of Wayrest Hard Bargains[edit] Travel to the City of Wayrest. Find Castle Wayrest, whose grounds occupy much of the north side of town. Head inside and speak to Morgiah in the throne room to hear her offer: ""You're trying to track down that letter of the Emperor's, yes? There are very few scandals in the Bay of which I am totally ignorant. I could give you some information, but nothing is without a price, that I know well.

Do not ask any questions -- get this letter to a certain high level sorcerer at the Necromancers' crypt, Scourg Barrow in the Dragontail Mountains. Avoid the rift. If you see it, you have gone too far. They will not be expecting you and will not wait for any introductions. The necromancers feel that death is a reward for the living, not a punishment.

He bought it from the thieves guild [sic] of Daggerfall after one of their number stole it from Queen Aubk-i. I confess I don't know why the Emperor sent it to Aubk-i. The girl is innocent to a fault, and everyone knows that Gothryd is not the loyal empire toady that Lysandus was. Of course my own family...well enough of this boring court gossip.

The letter says: Dear Stranger, I hope you will forgive me for what I have done, but I had no choice.  The mummy has haunted me every night since I found this cursed finger.  I've tried throwing it away, but it did no good.  A learned sage advised me that only by finding the mummy's tomb or by giving the finger away could I be rid of its hateful curse.  I am no warrior, and who would knowingly take up this burden for me?  You looked brave enough to endure the curse and perhaps solve it. Please understand, I meant you no harm, but I would have been killed or driven mad otherwise! From this moment on, you are cursed; a mummy will haunt you every night between midnight and 1 am if you are resting or loitering. It will not haunt you during fast travel, though.

""My (finger), my (finger)."" ""You have my (finger). Without it I cannot rest."" ""You may destroy me this night, but I shall return."" ""I will rise again to come for my (finger)."" And indeed it does return, every night. You can travel to the town your employer mentioned and find the individual you were tasked to deliver the package to originally, but this turns out to have been a ruse on your employer's part. Not only does the contact have nothing to say, you cannot give away the finger. Nor will you be paid the promised additional gold. To get rid of the curse, you must find the sage who is mentioned in the letter. Ask around about the finger and eventually you will be told of a particular temple, a town, or given a name to go on. Eventually, you will be able to ask about the sage's name as well. Once you know where to go, travel to the sage's town, enter the temple, and ask the sage for answers.

Finding the Letters[edit] Castle Necromoghan contains werewolves and undead monsters such as vampires. At higher levels you may encounter vampire ancients, which are deadly without some type of protection against Shock spells. There are several possible locations for the letters: Locations 1 and 2[edit]  From the dungeon's entrance, follow the hallway south and go through the door.   Continue following the passage upwards until you reach the end and exit through the door to the north.   Turn right and head up the eastern corridor until you reach a large room with six smaller rooms. There are several treasure piles in this room, one of which will lock the door to the area if touched. To unlock the door, pull the lever near the door to the southwest room, which is one of the possible locations for the letters.   If the letters are not in the small room, leave the larger room, head down the corridor, and continue west past the door. Turn north and enter the room to your right to find another possible location.  Location 3[edit]  Head east from the dungeon's entrance and go through the door in front of you. Jump or levitate over the pit in the floor and continue until you come to a four-way intersection.   Continue straight past the intersection until you reach a wall. Look at the ceiling above the pile of bones to find an opening. Climb the wall or levitate through the opening to reach another possible location.  Locations 4, 5, and 6[edit]  Activating this skull provides access to the sixth possible location for the letters. Head through the door to the east of the opening leading to the third location. Turn left when you reach the corridor with the tree trunks and follow the corridor east. There will be an opening in the ceiling and one in the floor just past it. Levitate through the opening in the ceiling and continue east through the door. Turn south and then east until you reach a pit with a skull on the wall (don't fall down the pit, as it will deplete your magic). Activate the skull and return to the third location.   At the back of this short corridor where location 3 was is an opening in the ceiling. Climb or levitate through the opening, which will take you to a room with a torture device and two doors. Go through the door to the west to find the fourth possible location. Open the south door and turn left after jumping over the pit. Continue east until you reach the room at the end of the corridor. Enter the room and look in the closet area to find the fifth possible location.   Go back through the corridor and head north at the three-way intersection. Go through the door at the end of this corridor and turn west. Follow this corridor to the south and go through the door at the end.   You will find yourself in a large room with a ramp leading down. Go through the door at the bottom of the ramp to find a trapdoor, which can only be opened by activating the skull by the pit. Drop down the pit to find a door leading to a small room. Enter the room to reach the sixth and final possible location for the letters.  The Letters[edit] The letters, stashed with some random loot  Pick up Mynisera's letters and a message appears, The letters are badly burned, but some words can still be read.

Her loyalty to Lysandus is almost as great as his foolish loyalty to the emperor. And those poor little children. How dreadful the butchery of the innocents.

I can see it does. Excuse my informality, but I feel like I know you, I recognize your craving as if it were my own. You want to control, and the thought makes you slaver like a starving wolf.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:A_Noble%27s_Debts","Talk to a merchant or innkeeper. Follow one of the quest paths to find the deed, the gold, and/or the noble. Return to your employer with either the deed or the gold, or after killing the noble within the time limit for your reward.","The Deadbeat Noble[edit] Speak to a merchant or innkeeper and he may say: ""Ah, my friend. I regret to admit that I made a poor business decision, but facts are facts. I loaned a certain sum of money to a noble by the name of (noble's name), who you may or may not have heard of. The security on the loan was the deed to a valuable piece of property. Now (noble's name) and the deed have both vanished. Rumor has it that (he/she) fell on some hard time financially, but the sum I loaned is not easily swallowed by my enterprises. Tangling with the likes of (noble's name) will likely be dangerous, but I need a champion. Will you help me, my friend, in exchange for a large uncut diamond?"" Accept[edit] The merchant or innkeeper goes on: ""That's good to hear. Now then, I have thirty days before I will be forced to dip into my capital. The deed was stolen out of a local establishment called (bank) in (first town) together with some other valuables, but the coincidence between (noble's name)'s disappearance at the same time the deed did merits investigation. (Noble's name)'s old residence was (noble's house) in (second town), which I understand is now empty. Other than that, I have no leads. I either need the gold (noble's name) borrowed, the deed to the house, or that aristocrat's head on a stick in thirty days. Don't let me down, (player's first name). Decline[edit] The merchant or innkeeper answers: ""I am sorry to hear that. I understand, of course, but it is disappointing."" Repossession[edit] To complete this quest, you must return to your employer after obtaining the deed, getting the gold, or killing the noble. The deed is located in a dungeon along with a letter containing the location of a second dungeon where the noble and the gold can be found. Once you have found the deed, you can either return to your employer or go to the second dungeon to find the other two objectives. There are three main paths you can take to locate the deed: Path 1: Thieves and Murderers[edit] This is the easiest method of learning the first dungeon's location. If your reputation with the Thieves Guild and/or the Dark Brotherhood is at least 15, you will receive a letter from one or both factions a few days after beginning the quest: You do not even realize that the young boy is next to you until you feel the letter slip into your hand. By the time you turn, he has disappeared, scurrying away so quickly you do not have a hope of catching him. The letters will reveal the location of the first dungeon, and if you receive one from the Thieves Guild, they will also give you 15 to 50 gold pieces or a trinket of similar value. The letters read: (Player's name),      (Noble's name) is a thief, but not one of ours. We would like (him/her) to be caught as well. Please accept this contribution to your expenses, and this other bit of information: (noble's name) is not working alone. There is a gang of mercenaries under (his/her) direction in a place called (dungeon). Some of (his/her) treasure may be kept there as well, but I do not think (noble's name) is there.      Good luck, (player's first name), and walk with Baan Dar. -- The Guild and Nightside Asylum Dear (player's first name),      We understand that you are looking for (noble's name). Because we respect you and your work, we have decided to help you in this matter. (Noble's name) used our services once some weeks ago, and we received our payments through a small but fierce band of (his/her) allies garrisoned at a camp called (first dungeon). If you are truly interested in finding (noble's name), you would be smart to start there.      Good luck and may Mephala steady thy aim. -- The Brotherhood Thanks to your underworld friends, you can now proceed straight to the first dungeon without having to bother with any further investigations. Path 2: Searching the Noble's House[edit] A mysterious rock left behind by the noble Your employer mentioned the noble had previously lived in a home in another town. Travel there, and find the noble's now-abandoned residence by asking around. Once you know where it is, gain entrance to the building by either picking the lock or using an Open spell. Inside the building you will find a random mineral on the ground. Pick up the mineral to investigate it and see: There is a stamp on the piece of (rock) that reads (first dungeon). Travel to the dungeon to search for the deed and a letter with the location of the second dungeon. Path 3: Investigating the Robbery[edit] If your reputation with The Prostitutes faction is at least 10, you will receive a letter directly from the prostitute shortly after starting the quest, allowing you to bypass the initial investigation stages: ""This is from (prostitute's name),"" a voice whispers and a young courier hands you a note. Before you can react, he scurries away. The letter reads: Dear (player's name),      I might have some information that might help your search for that rat (noble's name). If you're interested, ask for me in (prostitute's town) at a dump called (prostitute's building). And bring 10 gold pieces with you. This information ain't free. (Prostitute's name) Otherwise, you must follow the trail of clues, starting with: The Banker[edit] The banker is busy investigating the robbery Travel to the town where the robbed bank is located and enter during its normal hours. Find and speak to your contact; the information you are given depends on your reputation with The Merchants. If your reputation with the faction is less than 10, you are told: ""I'll tell you what I told (noble's name). (Bank) will reimburse all gold lost in the robbery down to the last penny. We just want to answer certain questions about the robbery itself. Things it would be best not discussed with a stranger, you understand."" Unfortunately, this path is now a dead end. You must investigate the house or receive a helpful letter to progress. However, if your reputation with The Merchants is at least 10, the banker will be much friendlier: ""Ah, good to see you, (player's first name). We are having a bit of excitement lately with the robbery and all. Only certain accounts and deposits were targetted [sic], so (guard's name), our security agent, is looking into the holders of those accounts. Perhaps (he/she) might be able to give you more information, (player's first name). (Guard's name) is at (guard's building) in (guard's town)."" The Guard[edit] The guard won't wait long for your arrival Travel to the town where the guard is staying immediately, as he or she will only be there for a day or two before leaving to investigate alone. When you arrive in town, ask around about the guard until you learn his or her location, and go speak with him or her. This guard will belong to a random Knight Order; your reputation with that Order will determine the kind of information you receive. If your reputation is 10 or higher, the guard will greet you warmly and appreciate your help: ""Ah, (player's name), my friend. I think we may be able to help each other in this affair. I know where (noble's name) has gone, but (his/her) allies are making it difficult to get to (him/her). Millions of gold pieces can buy some powerful friends. I need you to cut off this connection, and then meet me so we can together cut off (noble's name) altogether. Drop this letter off in (his/her) allies' stronghold (first dungeon) and then come to (second dungeon). With luck, the letter should distract those soldiers so (noble's name) will be relatively defenseless, except for (his/her) own guards of course. Very good, (player's first name), I will be seeing you soon."" With this information, you can now proceed to either of the two dungeons, though if you follow the guard's plan and drop the letter in the first dungeon it will greatly reduce the opposition you will face in the second one. However, if your reputation with the guard's faction is less than 10, you are instead told: ""I'm afraid I can't discuss this matter with you, (player's name). This affair only concerns (noble's name) and myself, no one else. If you're really interested in helping, go chat with (prostitute's name), a prostitute who had some kind of relationship with our friend (noble's name). She'll want ten gold pieces to cooperate, and you'll find her over in (prostitute's town) in a place called (prostitute's building). Good luck, (player's first name). I may not be here when you get back, but you are certainly capable of carrying on the investigations on your own."" The Prostitute[edit] This friendly young lady has a bone to pick with the noble as well Note: in the absence of third-party patches, this path of investigation may be broken (see bugs). If you have not yet learned the location of either dungeon by this point, you must follow a different path. Once you know the prostitute's location, head there and speak to her. As the guard or the letter told you, her information isn't free; talking to her brings up a prompt asking if you want to pay her. Say yes, and the kind courtesan says: ""Thank you, sweets. I've heard you're the decent sort, and I thought I'd give you a break. I was hired by (noble's name) a few weeks ago -- not for the reason you're thinkin. All I had to do was flirt with some old gaffer and get him to ask me out to dinner on a specific day. I guess to get him out of his house, because I found out later that the bloke's house was burgled while we was out. Lots of stuff was took, I hear. The old fella was cute and sweet and I felt bad about it. You may want to talk to him. His name's Chulmore Quill. Or you could go to the place where I met that (noble's name), (random residence) in (random town) and see if anyone there knows anything. Hope all this helps, (player's first name). I'd like to see old (noble's name) put away myself."" The residence the prostitute names is a random location with no additional clues (see bugs). Therefore, seek out the old gaffer she told you about. Be watchful after this meeting, as you will be randomly beset by knights until the quest ends. These mercenaries are sent by the noble, and searching a knight's corpse will reveal a note from their employer: (Player's name) is your target, a (player's race) adventurer and mercenary. Use extreme caution and be prepared for a fight. No jellyfish this one. -- (Noble's name) Chulmore Quill[edit] The ringmaster was duped by the noble, and isn't happy about it Head to the town and building where Chulmore Quill is staying, and speak with him. If your reputation with Quill is at least 10, he will give you a small amount of gold and reveal the location of both dungeons, greeting you with: ""Ah, (player's first name), my friend. Again, I have been seduced and betrayed. Truly I should join some monastery. My life would be simpler without women, (oath). Here, take this gold as my contribution toward the capture of that wicked (noble's name). I only wish I could afford to give more, but after recent events, I am impoverished. For your information, (noble's name) has two hideouts in (region), one in (first dungeon) and one in (second dungeon). I do not know which if either of these is being used currently, but I would advise you to prepare your finest blade. (Noble's name) will not go down easily. Good luck and (god's name) be with you."" If your reputation with him is lower than 10, he will only give you the location of the first dungeon (and insult your mother): ""Why should I tell you anything I know about anything? You're just a patsy of (employer's name) who'd screw me like (noble's name) screwed me or that (god's name) damned (prostitute's name) screwed me. Find some hole like (first dungeon) to crawl in, wither up, and die, you child of a chancred (player's race) whore."" If Quill only gave you the location of the first dungeon, go there and continue your search for the items your employer wants back. If you learned the locations of both, you can head to either one at your discretion. Exploring the Dungeons[edit] You may find yourself dogged by knights The dungeon is protected by a literal army of rogues, spellswords, and barbarians The stolen deed Your employer's gold The noble will stop at nothing to stop you  The remainder of this quest is a dungeon crawl (or two, if you wish). Travel to the first dungeon. Searching within will uncover a letter, which is about you and contains the location of the second dungeon. It reads: I'm going to need some reinforcements if the rumors about this (player's race) are correct. Keep the deed in hiding in (first dungeon) but bring the gold and your men over here to (second dungeon). We'll discuss this further when you arrive. -- (Noble's name) Taking the letter does not cause the parchment on the floor to disappear, as there is another document to pick up. Do so, and a message pops up: This looks like the deed (noble's name) gave (employer's name) as collaterial [sic]. Indeed, you have found the missing deed. It reads: This document bears witness to the ownership of (deed residence) of (deed residence town) in (region). Let all who read this know that (noble's name) is the sole and rightful owner of the afore mentioned [sic] property. Note: due to an error, the locations of the deed and the gold are transposed (see bugs). This does not affect the outcome of the quest, however. You can return the deed to your employer and complete the quest immediately, if you wish. Otherwise, you can head to the second dungeon now that its location is known to you. If you are helping carry out the guard's plan, you already know the location of the second dungeon and can skip finding the deed entirely. However, your purpose here is to drop the counterfeit note the guard gave you anywhere inside this dungeon. Leaving the fake letter will reduce the number of enemies that will appear in the second dungeon. The false note reads: ""Change of agenda, folks. I need you in (employer's town) right away. Get over there and wait for my response. Shouldn't take longer than a few days. -- (Noble's name) Travel to the second dungeon. This is the noble's lair; you will face considerably more resistance here than inside the first dungeon. Once you enter, along with the dungeon's normal denizens you will be randomly harassed by legions of rogues, spellswords, and (if you did not drop the guard's note in the first dungeon) barbarians until the quest ends. Fight your way through these enemies and somewhere within, you will find the noble guarding your employer's stolen gold. The noble appears as a warrior; if it is your target, a message pops up upon hitting them the first time: You know immediately that this must be (noble's name). And when killed: You have slain (noble's name), without a doubt. Nearby you will find the missing gold. Pick it up and a message appears: This appears to be the gold that (employer's name) loaned to (noble's name). Remember that you only need to retrieve the gold or kill the noble, but not both, to successfully complete the quest. Once you have done either (or both), return to your employer for your reward. Reward[edit] After you return to your employer having completed at least one of the three objectives, you hear in response: ""(Noble's name)'s trick didn't work, did it, (player's first name)? Here's the diamond I promised. Well done, my friend."" Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] A successfully completed quest results in a reputation gain according to the table below.

There may be multiple mages inside the dungeon, but you must slay the specified target for the quest to count as a success. When hit for the first time, the mage will offer you a deal: ""Wait! I know that Nocturnal has sent you, and that she has promised you the Skeleton's Key. But if it is truly power you seek, I can top her offer -- if you cease your attack, I will tell you where to find (artifact). Do you agree to my offer?"" The artifact in question will be Auriel's Bow, unless you already have that artifact in your inventory. If you do, the mage instead offers the Warlock's Ring (though this does not work as intended; see bugs). Accept the Offer[edit] The mage continues: ""Excellent. I knew you had a mercenary's heart. (Artifact) lies hidden in (artifact dungeon). You have only to find it and you will be a power to be reckoned with indeed. Now, I bid you good day, lest you decide to claim both (artifact) and the Skeleton's Key by killing me. A mercenary heart such as yours should not be trusted too far!"" Accepting the offer means betraying Nocturnal; after about a day she will send her minions after you. In addition you will lose 20 reputation with the Daedra Prince. Travel to this new dungeon and find the artifact within. It will look like some rusty dungeon equipment, so you may want to use Info Mode (by default, the F3-key) when you come across any such items. It will say ""You see a Auriel's Bow"" etc., if you have located the artifact. Pick it up and leave the dungeon.

(Competitor's name) has a store in (town) called (store) and in it is a (magical item) that I want you liberate. And, on your way out, please drop this note off anywhere in the store. I can't resist. (Competitor's name) is going to passing [sic] that (magical item) to a more secure location in (time limit) days, so you'll need to move swiftly. If you're not back in that time, your gold will be forfeit. And do I even need to add that (store) will be guarded? Probably not. Good luck."" Decline[edit] The merchant or innkeeper answers: (Oath), scruples make me rash."" Shoplifting[edit] Your employer gives you the note to leave behind, which reads: (Competitor's name), Fine security for your security. Your Dear Friend Head to the specified town and enter the store during its open hours. Find the magical item, which will be somewhere in the store, lying on the floor. Pick it up and drop the note instead. Sometimes, there are guards in the store; you may be accosted by a single battlemage or knight, or a pair of rogues or warriors. Take care of or run away from any resistance and head back to the town where your employer is waiting. If you remembered to drop the note, up to thirty-six hours later you will be approached: A young boy hands you a letter and runs away before you have a chance to question him."" Check your inventory and find the letter, which reads: (Residence) (Competitor's town) Dear (player's name), I received your note. Very amusing. Now I have a proposition for you to consider. Bring me the stolen (magical item) and I will recompense you with a (gem). If you bring that (magical item) to your employer, you will have made an enemy. (Competitor's name) You now have two choices: bring the magical item to your employer, or return it to its rightful owner. If you wish to successfully complete the quest, return to your employer and collect your reward. However, if you wish to deal with the item's owner instead, head to the town named in the competitor's letter. Ask around in town until you learn the location of the residence named in the letter's header. The entrance will be locked, so be prepared with your preferred method of dealing with locked doors. Once inside, find and speak to the owner of the item to deliver it. Reward[edit] If you deliver the magical item as instructed, your employer says: ""Well done indeed, (player's first name). Ah yes, lovely, lovely (magical item). There can be no doubt that this is the very same (magical item) (competitor's name)'s partner gave (him/her) for security. You have certainly earned your (random gold) gold pieces."" If you decide to seek out and talk to your employer's competitor, a decision prompt appears: Do you give (competitor's name) the (magical item) in exchange for the (gem)? If you say yes, the competitor rewards you as promised in the letter: A wise decision, (player's first name). This may be the beginning of a profitable relationship. The days of (quest giver's name) making a profit, on the other hand, may well be passing. If you refuse, the competitor chides you: ""I don't know why you came here then. Leave this place now, (player's first name)."" You can then return to your employer and deliver the item. Note that if you give the magical item to your employer, The Merchants will not take kindly to this theft. You will lose 10 reputation points with the faction if you do so. If your employer is a member of the faction, this still ends the quest with a net 5 point increase as most quests do. But if the quest giver belongs to a different faction, you will gain 15 points with that faction while losing the 10 with The Merchants. Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] A successfully completed quest results in a reputation gain according to the table below. Faction/Person Reputation Gain   Questgiver's faction +15   Questgiver's associated factions +7 A failed quest (time limit expired) results in a reputation loss according to the table below.

Would you be willing to assist with the exorcism, if that's what the situation requires?"" Accept[edit] The quest giver goes on: ""Would you? (Oath), you have a heart as big as (region), (player's guild title). The child's name is (child's name), (he/she)'s a (child's description) over at (residence) here in (child's town), but the person you'll want to speak with is (his/her) guardian, (guardian's name) over in (tavern).

I'll expect this whole unfortunate affair to be resolved in (time limit) days and to see you here then. Good luck, (temple god) be with you."" Decline[edit] The quest giver answers: ""That's unfortunate. I hope we can find someone else then."" Exorcise the Daedra[edit] This quest can follow one of two paths, depending upon whether the possession is real or faked. The possession is real[edit] The child's guardian is staying in a local tavern. Go there and find the knight, who will say: ""You've come from (temple)? Please tell me you can help little (child's name), I can't stand to see (him/her) suffer so. I don't know what to do with (him/her). Please, take a look at (him/her) and then see if you can persuade that (priest(ess)' name) to help. (Child's name) has always been such a sweet (child's description), but now ... If you want to see (him/her), (he/she) is at (residence). I don't know what else I can do."" Before you travel to the priest(ess), go see the child for yourself. It would appear that the possession is real, as the child will speak gibberish as proof: ""Gruh, you colly-eyed mortal greel, I would open all your veins and swim in your blood, steaming. They call me (daedra's name), the licker of cat droppings! or ""Poor little (child's name), (he/she)'s rotting in Oblivion, and no one will help (him/her), but kind, kind, kind, kind, kind, kind, kind, kind, kind, kind, kind, kind, kind, kind (daedra's name). or ""There once was a girl named Vivian, Who met (daedra's name) of Oblivion, They decided to mate, and later they ate (child's name), their child, yum, yum."" Travel to the town where the priest(ess) can be found and talk to him/her. He will say: ""(Daedra's name)? (Child's name) did mention the name (daedra's name)? Well, if this possession is a sham, it is at least a well-researched one. Here then is the (holy item). Just hold it with you when you next speak with the child. But beware, the daedra (child's name) mentioned is a Daedroth of great power. When the exorcism is complete, it will leave (him/her) and appear elsewhere in (residence). Be ready for a battle when it does. Good luck, (player's first name). (Temple's deity) be with you."" Head back to the residence and give the holy item and to the child, who will react immediately: ""(Daedra's name) ... oh, (oath) ... (Daedra's name) is out of me ... but ... it's still here."" (Child's name) runs away. And you can, indeed, feel an alien presence in (residence). The possessing daedroth will appear somewhere in the building. Dispose of it and report back to the quest giver or the priest(ess) who gave you the holy item. You will receive a holy item as a reward. The possession is a sham[edit] This friendly prostitute knows some things - for the right price, that is  Talk to the child's guardian. In this case, the knight will say: ""You're from (temple)? Thank (temple god) you're here. They say you can get to (priest(ess)' name), the exorcist in (town) and (he/she) has some special (holy item) for possessions like this. I can't convince (priest(ess)' name) to get me the (holy item) myself, but someone like you with the authority of (temple) could. Go to (town) and talk to (him/her). I know you can convince (him/her)."" See the child before you travel to the priest(ess), and be told the same gibberish as before. Again, this will be enough to convince the priest(ess) to at least give you the holy item. Return to the residence with the holy item and give it to the child, who will say: ""Oh, (oath), (oath) ... I feel ... so much better. (Guardian's name) told me that the (holy item) would help us, and (he/she) was right. Oh thank you, kind (player's guild rank). I'll keep this (holy item) for protection. Goodbye!"" The child will run away afterwards. However, the marked absence of an angry, attacking daedroth should make it readily apparent that the guardian and the child have concocted this whole story, apparently to get their hands on the holy item. Return to the tavern and seek out the guardian for some answers. When you arrive, you will notice the knight is gone, being replaced by a prostitute. Speak to her, and she says: ""Good day to thee, (player's guild title). You're probably looking for that (guardian's description), (guardian's name), who slipped out of here after boasting about stealing some kind of (holy item) from (temple). If you have fifty gold pieces to spare a friend, I could let you know where (guardian's name) went. What do you say?"" Agree, as the prostitute will not make this offer again. She then tells you: ""Nice doing business with you, (player's first name). You'll find that (guardian's description) over in (guardian's residence)."" Ask in town until you know where this hiding place is located. Confront the guardian there, who will flee in a panic, shouting: ""Don't hurt me!"" (Guardian's name) hands you the (holy item) and flees."" Report back to the quest giver or the priest(ess) from whom you got the holy item to complete the quest. Reward[edit] When you return after taking care of the possession or getting the holy item back, the quest giver or priest(ess) will say: ""Thank (Temple's deity)/(Priest(ess)' temple's deity) that situation's resolved. You can never really tell from the start whether an exorcism is really merited or not. You've done well, (player's first name).

Meet him and he will say to you: ""Thank you for coming, (player's first name). The Oracle has foreseen the death of one of the great nobles of (noble's town), the noble (noble's name), and like a pebble in a still pond, (his/her) death will lead to great calamity for (region). I have tried speaking with (him/her), but I am not permitted to enter (his/her) company in (residence). My mistress, the Oracle, intends to come to (noble's town) speak [sic] with (his/her) Grace, and I last heard that she was in (Oracle's town). I am not familiar with these parts, so I don't know how far away that is. I need you to either talk to (noble's name) and convince (him/her) to protect (him/her)- self, or find the Oracle somewhere near (Oracle's town) and bring her to see (him/her). There is precious little time. Please, I beg thee, hurry."" The noble Afterward, you may speak to the noble if you like. Follow the Acolyte's directions to their location. The noble tells you: ""As I told that blasted Acolyte, I am not interested in hiding my head because some mad old crone had a bad dream about me. As it happens, I am waiting for some word about my love, (lover's name) who was kidnapped. I will listen to (his/her) advice on this matter, but I will not go into hiding while (he/she) remains in danger. I should never have let (him/her) go within a hundred feet of (dungeon) without proper escort, but I will certainly not abandon my love now. There is your answer, (player's guild rank)."" You can proceed with this quest in two ways: Option 1: Rescue the Lover[edit] The noble's lover Travel to the dungeon the noble mentioned, and find the lover within. Speak to the lover, who says: ""You've come from (noble's name) to rescue me? (Oath), let us make haste then. I've had a terrible -- and, I fear, prophetic -- dream about (him/her)."" Escort the lover back to the noble: (Noble's name) and (lover's name) embrace, and then (he/she) pleads that, for the good of all (region), (noble's name) bust go into hiding with (his/her) most trusted guards. At once, (he/she) agrees, but not before giving you (random gold) gold pieces in gratitude for rescuing (his/her) love. Option 2: Bring the Oracle to the Noble[edit] The Oracle  Travel to the town the Acolyte mentioned and talk to the Oracle, who will be in the local temple there. She says: ""You are (player's name), the (player's race) my Acolyte sent to escort me to (noble's name). I gave my eyes to the gods, you see, and I saw your approach through their eyes. Now, let us hurry to (residence) in (noble's town) before (noble's name)'s fate is set."" Bring the Oracle back to the noble, and witness the following: The Oracle speaks to (noble's name), and her calm, persuasive tones work their magic. It takes only a few moments for (him/her) to recognize the wisdom in her advice, and (he/she) agrees to go into hiding for a few days for the good of (region). The Oracle thanks you for escorting her and tells you that she will recommend you to the court of Sentinel for your bravery and resourcefulness. Thus convinced, the noble will then go into hiding. Choosing this path will not get you any material reward, but due to the Oracle's connections will increase your reputation with the Kingdom of Sentinel. Reward[edit] When the noble is finally convinced to go into hiding, you receive the following notification from the Guildmagister (probably in your mind): You are a credit to the guild (player's first name). Note, you can bring both the lover and the Oracle to the noble. However, you will not receive a gold reward, you will only get the Oracle's reward of reputation with Sentinel. If the time limit expires before you can convince the noble to go into hiding, your failure is noted with an ominous message: It is too late. The hour has come when fate has won the war with human will. The wind itself whispers (noble's name) is dead. (Region) will tremble.

Find the emperor's letter in Gortwog's Fortress. Return the emperor's letter to Mynisera.","Mynisera needs your assistance once more Gortwog gives you an opportunity to take back the emperor's letter Return to Mynisera[edit] When you last spoke to Mynisera, she asked you to return if you discovered who has Emperor Uriel VII's missing letter. After completing a personal quest for either Princess Morgiah or Queen Barenziah, you learned that the letter is in the hands of Gortwog of Orsinium. However, while the nobles of Wayrest have this information, only Mynisera can make a treaty with the Orc Warlord. Speak with her once you have learned the letter's location and she says: ""So Morgiah says Gortwog has the emperor's letter. Very interesting. I think I have a way to get Gortwog to turn over that letter. Are you willing to brave the depths of Orsinium to try to retrieve it?"" Agree, and Mynisera continues: ""Gortwog wants very badly to be recognized by the empire. It would mean the beginning of peace between the orcs and the other races of the empire. Present this letter to Gortwog. Hopefully it will persuade him to cooperate."" Mynisera's letter to Gortwog appears in your inventory. It reads: Lord Gortwog,  King of Orcs,  Warlord of the Subterranean Realms     Hail and long life King Gortwog. Long  have you and the Orcish people sought  formal recognition by the empire. My dead  husband King Lysandus supported your claim  to sovreign [sic] rule. I would now help you in  your cause. Sadly, a minor missive from  the emperor has been misplaced. For me to  truly hold the trust and ear of Emperor  Uriel Septim, I need to reclaim this note.  Should you be able to place in my servant's  hand this trifling letter, I would be far  better able to forward your claim to the  emperor and his court.  The Dowager Mynisera,  Queen Mother to King Gothryd of Daggerfall In the Hall of the Orc King[edit] Travel to Orsinium. Enter the fortress and speak to Gortwog. Gortwog will respond to Mynisera's suggestion as follows: ""So, Mynisera seeks to sweet talk me. Bah! Her letter is of no value to me anymore. She may have it. However, my people may not be so lenient toward a (player's race) wandering the halls of Orsinium. If you can survive my realm and find the letter, you make [sic] take it back to her. I will also consider you to be a worthy (player's race)."" While Gortwog 'allows' you to fight your way through Orsinium to find the letter, it will not be an easy task. Be prepared before venturing onward.  Finding the Letter[edit]  Upon entering the stronghold, you find yourself in the main hall, together with Gortwog and three orcs. The warlord will not attack you unless provoked, but the soldier will attack you as soon as he detects you. Go past Gortwog and through the left door at the back of the great hall. Once you open the door the orc shaman will attack you. Follow the hallway up and go through the door. Beware of the various orc warriors and shamans you will encounter along your way. In the bowels of the stronghold you may even encounter some Daedroths.   Follow the hallway further upwards.   Follow the hallway until you come to an intersection, from there go south.   Follow the hallway until you come to a sort of dining-room. Leave the room through the west door.   Go down the hallway and through the door.   Walk down the hallway until you come to a door. Go through it and you will find yourself in a huge chamber with a hollow truncated pyramid.   To proceed further, you must reach the level above the truncated pyramid. If you cannot levitate to the level above by yourself, jump into the fountain in the northeast corner of the chamber, it will teleport you to the platform right above the pyramid. Alternatively, you can take the staircase behind the south door, which will also lead to the upper level.   From the platform go up the west staircase and head south past an intersection until you come to  a second intersection and a door. The door will be locked, so open it with either lockpicks, magic or your weapon. Once the door is open, go through it.   Follow this hallway past an intersection, then head south, past a secret door and go through the door at the end of the hallway.   Follow the hallway further south, walk through a short cavern passage and head east. Follow the hallway once again through a short cavern passage, head west than turn north. Go through the door at the end of the hallway.   Walk downwards the hallway and south past an intersection until you reach a second intersection. Head west at this junction and follow the hallway north.   Head west through the door and the textures of the environment will change. Head south at the intersection and follow the hallway until you reach a door, go through that door.   Finally you have found the room where the emperor's letter is hidden. It will be on the pedestal in the middle of the pit. There is a ramp in the northwest corner leading down. When you approach the pedestal, four orc soldiers will come out from the north and the south door, so be prepared for them. Pick up the letter and bring it back to Mynisera at Castle Daggerfall.  Deliver the Letter[edit] Upon reading the letter at long last, Mynisera grows worried: ""(Player's first name), this letter is dangerous. Gortwog had undoubtedly sold copies of it to everyone from Wayrest to the Underking. After all, if the powers of the Iliac Bay become embroiled in war over the Totem, he stands to gain quite a lot. Go now. You have done your job. I am sure the Totem will find its way into your life somehow. You seem to have a knack for such things. Just remember, the only safe master of the Totem is the emperor."" Beware, if you entered the room to speak to Mynisera the guards will attack you until you exit the castle.

Return the painting to the queen for your reward.","Akorithi wants a very special painting Once you have reached the required level and reputation with Queen Akorithi, and have also completed Prince Lhotun's quest, the following scene occurs: A page girl bearing the crest of Sentinel stiffly presents you a crisply pressed envelope. Ignoring your queries, she turns and walks away. Check your inventory for a new letter and read it: Dear (player's name), Your presence is [sic] our court is desired before the end of the next season. Prince Lhotun has recommended you with high praise. I await your arrival. Akorithi Queen of Sentinel Travel to the City of Sentinel. Enter the castle, go to the garden in the back, and take the elevator in a room off the right wall. Follow the hallway to the throne room, where the Queen greets you: ""(Player's name)! Welcome to Sentinel. I trust you have had a comfortable stay so far. Let me get right to the point. My son, Prince Lhotun, says you are a well respected and trusted (player's race). I have need of your sort. I am willing to pay you (random gold) gold to infiltrate Castle Wayrest and recover an heirloom of the late King Lysandus for me. Will you do it?""

Bring it to me and I will pay your (random gold) gold."" Take your leave, and travel to the City of Wayrest. Find and enter Castle Wayrest to begin your search.  Finding the Painting[edit] In the castle dungeons you will encounter mostly knights, orc shamans, centaurs, wraiths, and vampires.   Starting from the dining hall, take the door to the north. If you do not sneak through the doorway, the royal knights will start to attack you. One of them is right in front of you in the hallway. From the intersection, go west and up the stairs. Follow the hallway until you reach a room with several open coffins.   In this room there are many open coffins and corpses. On the south wall there is a red brick teleporter. Head on through it.   You will be teleported into some sort of armory with another teleporter. Go through this teleporter as well.   You will be teleported to the northwest corner of a tiny room with yet another teleporter. Take it to go to the next area.   You will find yourself in a room with a torture instrument. Leave the room through the south door and follow the hallway to the west. After passing through the door, go south.   Follow the hallway west, past an intersection and go down the stairs. Follow the hallway further past a secret door and go up the stairs. Go through the door at the end of the hallway to reach the sewers.   Walk along the sewers, making sure not to fall in if you aren't prepared for swimming. The water usually contains slaughterfish & dreughs, but it can also contain undead and, at higher levels, lamiae. Jump into the water at the west side of the room and look at the wall. There is a small underwater passage which leads to an inner chamber with more aquatic enemies. Crouch and swim through the passage, then climb out of the water and go through the locked door at the east side of the chamber.   Follow the stairs up and go east to find a small opening in the wall. Walk towards it and climb the bottom part of the wall until you stop, then jump to vault through the opening. Go up the stairs and head west through the door at the end of the hallway.   You will find yourself in some sort of meeting-room. Go through the locked door to the south, then go up the stairs and continue south.   Follow the hallway further south and turn east at the intersection. Go past a door and turn south.   Head further south and go down the stairs. Follow the hallway and go through the door. Go down the stairs, follow the hallway and go through the door at the end to reach the room where the painting is located.   When you approach the painting, one knight will come out from each of the doors, so be ready for them. Take the painting after dispatching the knights.  The hidden painting As you examine the painting a little more closely, you notice it definitely isn't a normal painting. The scene in the painting shifts and twists. You can clearly see the inside of a tent. Several men in the livery of Wayrest are intensely debating with a man bearing the coat of arms of Daggerfall. One of the Wayrest men slips behind the Daggerfall man, draws a dagger and casually slides it between his ribs. The image fades as the life ebbs from his body.  Getting out of the Dungeons[edit] If you have no Recall spell, you must return to the teleporter room with the torture instrument to get back.  From this room, walk a few steps to the east and enter the room. Go through the secret door on the east wall.   Follow the orange passage up the stairs, jumping or climbing if necessary. Follow the passage up until you come to a small intersection and a handwheel. Turn the handwheel to open the magically-locked door at the end of the passage, then continue through.   Leave the room through the west door, cross the hallway, and enter the room on the other side. Go through the red brick teleporter in this room.   You will emerge in a fountain. Walk down the stairs and go north at the intersection. Continue until you reach a room at the end, and go through the teleporter on the south wall.   Leave this room through the secret door on the south wall and go through the orange colored passage. Once you reach the hallway, go north and enter the room. Leave the room through the red brick teleporter.   You will be teleported to the room where you started your teleporter journey. Leave this room through the east door.   Return to the dining room and exit the castle quickly, as the guards will all be hostile towards you now.  Returning the Painting[edit] The queen awaits your return Return to Castle Sentinel and speak to Akorithi, who will ask if you examined the painting. If you tell her you didn't, she will say, ""Excellent. Its properties are inappropriate for those not of royal blood. You have shown yourself to be not only loyal, but also obedient."" If you tell her you did, she will say, ""You presume much (player's name). What you saw is not for the prying eyes of the masses. It concerns matters of royalty and will be dealt with by royalty.""

Decline[edit] The Guildmagister answers: ""So, why did you ask me for work? Sometimes I really cannot understand you common adventurers."" Finding the Imp[edit] Remember that you need at least a steel weapon to harm imps, though acquiring such a weapon shouldn't be a problem. Imps are also vulnerable to Destruction magic and hand-to-hand attacks. Head to the dungeon the Guildmagister mentioned and enter it. You may encounter more than one imp at low levels, where they show up more often as random dungeon inhabitants; the target imp will likely be the only one of its kind in the entire dungeon at higher levels. However, there are also some special dungeon modules were you will always encounter an imp in a cage. These dungeon modules are a variation of the throne room, such as the one found in Privateer's Hold. At the bottom of the grand staircase, there is a room which always contains an imp in a cage. This caged imp is never your quest object. Once you have found the target creature and hit it once, a notification appears in which the imp says: ""I would rather die than go back to the Mages Guild laboratory."" However, if you kill the imp with one strike (which is very easy to do at higher levels with an advanced weapon or a powerful spell) you won't get this notification. So, if you want to be on the safe side, use only a weapon which does a minimum of damage when you encounter an imp during this quest. Once the imp is dead, report back to the Guildmagister and receive the thanks of the Mages Guild. Reward[edit] When you return after killing the imp, the Guildmagister will thank you by saying: ""What a relief. I owe you a small debt (player's name).

Exit the dungeon into the outdoors.","After creating your character, you begin the game in a cave near a campfire. The first thing you should do is equip any weapons you have in your inventory and save your character. Go south and leave the cave; there is a secret door into another room at the end of the passage. The first enemy you will encounter is a rat guarding a treasure pile. Kill the rat and take the treasure, then climb up the stairs to the west.   Proceed down the long corridor. After you kill the bat in the hallway, take the first door on your left. The door leads to a room with an imp, so if you don't have a steel weapon yet, you may want to come back later to avoid being killed by the imp's spells. There is also a treasure pile in one of the cages in this room.   Follow the corridor further until you reach a second door. This second room contains a rat. As you continue, you'll see a third door and stairs leading down to the east. Go down the stairs to find a thief, who will drop some useful armor and equipment. Try to take him by surprise with a backstab, as he can be difficult at lower levels.   Keep going down the hallway until you come to some stairs leading upwards. Go up the stairs and through the door to find yourself in a room facing an archer behind a U-shaped table. The archer will not walk around the table, so using melee attacks from across the table and quickly backing away can be a safe way to dispatch him.   Now you are in a big room with a grand staircase leading to a throne on a platform (opening the door opposite the staircase is not recommended, as you will be greeted by a tough grizzly bear). At the top of the massive staircase is a skeletal warrior. Choose whether to fight or run; once you are past, jump onto the raised platform with the throne and pull the lever beside the platform. The throne will rise up, allowing you to reach the balcony above and move on to the next level. You can also try to climb the wall to reach the balcony, but it is safer and easier to use the platform.   An alternative way to get past the skeleton is longer, but much safer. Go around the left side of the staircase, moving past the support and to the corner. To the right you can see a part of the wall on which the textures don't exactly match the ones around it. This is a secret door. Go through and continue straight until you pass through the brown passage. Watch out for the archers in the rooms near the start of the brown passageway. Climb the stairs and go through the door at the end, which leads to the balcony above the throne.   The exit at last Once you have reached the balcony, follow the corridor and take the first door you come across. This room contains a rat, a bat, and an imp. If you're quick, you should be able to lure the bat outside and kill it, then take out the imp and the rat. The exit looks like a cave with a skull in it along the wall. Exit the dungeon and the quest will be completed. Privateer's Hold exterior"

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Protect_Guild","Talk to the Guildmagister at a Mages Guild hall. Guard the mage for three hours, killing any attackers who show up. Once the three hours have passed, you will receive a notification and your reward.","Entranced[edit] Speak to the Guildmagister, who says: ""I am (Guildmagister's name), servant to the mighty (mage's name). I have been instructed to find guild members to protect (him/her) while (he/she) lies in a spell trance. (Mage's name) suspects that a rival of (his/her) may send assassins to slay (him/her) while (he/she) is helpless. (He/She) will give you an ensorcelled (magical item) if the assassins are stopped. Will you take up this quest?"" or ""It is a very great honor, my dear (player's first name), to be selected to aid the famous (mage's name), whom I trust you have heard of before. Yes, (he/she) has specifically asked for you to guard (him/her) while (he/she) sleeps. Obviously, a mage of such standing has enemies jealous of (his/her) enormous power. I trust you will accept this honor?"" Accept[edit] The Guildmagister goes on: ""As I expected. (Mage's name) is just beginning his three hour trance, so you must guard The Mages Guild during that time and protect him while he is vulnerable. At the end of his trance, he will be transported to the Aetherius. Once he is safe, the Guild will send someone with your reward."" Decline[edit] The Guildmagister answers: ""Hmmm. Guild members are normally more helpful. I am sure (mage's name) will remember this."" Bodyguard Duty[edit] The nightblades appear from the shadows The three-hour time limit begins as soon as you accept the quest. The mage you are tasked to protect appears somewhere inside the guild hall, so either stand around or loiter until the attackers show up. When the attack begins, three nightblades enter the Mages Guild. Upon attacking them, one says: ""Stand aside, apprentice whelp! We mean to cut down (mage's name) before he can awaken. Move or we'll cut you down too."" The ensuing fight should not be too difficult unless your level is low. Once the nightblades are dead, loiter for another two to three hours until you receive the quest ending message. The corpses of the three attackers will vanish once the quest ends, so be sure to loot them while you can. Do not speak to the mage you are guarding. This will break the trance and you will be met with the following: ""Fool! You should know better that [sic] to disturb a mage in a spell trance. You shall pay for this! Leave this guild hall now. I will bring this matter before the Circle."" At this point, you have failed the quest and the mage becomes aggressive and attacks. If you retaliate, the mage lays out the consequences of fighting: ""If you kill me, you will be thrown out of the Mages Guild! Leave now or suffer the consequences."" If you ignore this warning and kill the mage, you lose a considerable amount of reputation with the Mages Guild. Additionally, the Guild will rally to defend their fallen member by sending battlemages after you, who shout when you engage in battle: ""Alert the Archmagister! This (player's race) assassin has killed (mage's name)! Bar the doors! To arms, to arms!"" The Guild will also send hired minions to kill you for the next week. Reward[edit] When you have completed the assignment, you receive the following message: A young woman in deep blue robes bows low before you. ""The Guild sends its compliments on a job well done.

Accept[edit] The beldam goes on: ""Wouldst thou? The name of the tome is (book title) -- a very rare book indeed. Even if one were to find a copy, the price would be quite prohibitive. We are lucky, therefore, to have a friend in (town), a (contact's description) named (contact's name) who has stolen a copy. If thou wouldst meet (him/her) at (building), (he/she) will give thee the book. We will expect thee back in (time limit) days. After that time, the book will be of no use to us.

A simple errand: travel to the town named by the beldam and meet your contact in a building there. Speak to the book thief and you will hear: ""Awright, (player's first name), here's the book. Just watch yourself. The guards are combing (town) for that thing."" As soon as you receive the book, someone shouts: ""Stop! Thief!"" The source of the shouting soon becomes apparent as a knight appears and attacks you. You can either stay and fight or make your escape; it makes no difference for the quest outcome. Bring the book back to the beldam (you may encounter more knights on your way back) and collect your reward. Reward[edit] After receiving the book the beldam says: ""Ah, there it is. I hoped you had an opportunity to peruse the page, good (player's first name). You are not likely to find its like again very soon. Well, here is your (magical item)."" If instead the time limit expires before you can return with the book, a message appears: It suddenly occurs to you that the witches expected the book at this very moment. Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] A successfully completed quest results in a reputation gain according to the table below. Faction/Person Reputation Gain   Witch Coven +5 A failed quest (time limit expired) results in a reputation loss according to the table below. Faction/Person Reputation Gain   Witch Coven -2 Additional Reputation[edit] When you get the tome from the contact your Regional Reputation will decrease by 30 points.

Rats in the Walls[edit] The rats of the Iliac Bay grow quite large  This quest is similar to the members-only quest Hunt for Giant Rodents, but the targets are always rats in this one. Head to the building in town and kill all rats that appear. At every five in-game minutes there is a 75% chance that one rat will appear; there can be a maximum of seven rats altogether.

If you wish to fight the creature, it may be easier to take care of him before attempting to recover the lost item, especially if he is in a small room.

After you destroy the lich and recover the relic, return to the Temple to collect your reward. Reward[edit] When you hand the relic over, the quest giver says: ""Praise to great (temple's god)!

Once you have found it, pick it up and receive a notification: This must be the parchment (Guildmagister's name) sent you to find. Be warned, reading the scroll will summon an Ice Atronach which will attack you, so it is advised to keep your eyes off the scroll.

There's a possibility of risk, but a certainty of profit for both of us. Your share would be (random gold) gold pieces. What do you say?"" or ""Smuggling is a nasty word, isn't it?

Remember that, (player's first name)."" or ""In that case, I will deny ever meeting you."" Running the Goods[edit] As soon as you accept the quest, your regional reputation will drop dramatically, by 100 points to be precise. There are two paths the quest can take: The normal path is very straightforward; just head to the town and find the contact mentioned by your employer. Ask around for the location of the residence your employer named and enter it. Be prepared to pick the lock or cast an Open spell if the door is locked. Find and speak to the contact within to deliver the contraband. You will get your reward and your regional reputation will be restored. The quest will not always run this smoothly, however. Sometimes, the meeting will be a trap; up to about seven hours after accepting the quest, you will receive a notification: A letter has been slipped into your hands. Check your inventory for the letter and read it: ""Dear (player's name),       You have been set up. (Contact's name)  is not at (residence). A knight named (knight's name) is waiting there to ambush you. If you want to get rid of that (contraband), bring it to me at (tavern) here in (second town). (Second contact's name) The letter's claims are true, and entering the residence in this scenario becomes entirely optional. If you do decide to go inside, your contact will not be there; instead you will encounter an agent of the region's ruler, the knight mentioned in the letter. The knight will immediately attack you, and upon being hit will say: ""Wait a minute, kid. We don't want you. Just (employer's name) and the (contraband). Hand it over and you can get out of here, okay?"" or ""Listen, kid, nothing personal. Just gimme the (contraband) and I'll tell my boss you got away. Deal?"" If you hand over the goods, the knight will stop attacking you and say: ""Yer a smart kid. Now, get outta here."" Of course, if you hand over the contraband you cannot deliver it. Thus, you cannot complete the quest and your lost reputation will not be restored. However, if you have handed it over you can then attack and kill the knight, retrieve the item from the corpse, and proceed with the quest. If you don't hand it over, fight or escape from the knight and make your way to the town mentioned in the letter. Find the tavern mentioned in the letter, head inside, and meet the new contact to get rid of the contraband and complete the quest. Reward[edit] If the quest proceeds normally, when you deliver the contraband your contact says: ""Jolly nerve-wracking sitting here, waiting for you, (player's first name). Ah, the (contraband). Good quality this. Here, here's the (random gold) gold pieces. Good doing business with you and (employer's name)."" If you were set up and deliver the contraband to the second contact, you will hear: ""Ah, you received my letter. Good thing for you. There was a nasty situation brewing and I'd hate to have you caught up in it. I'll take that (contraband) in return for my services clearing up your involvement in this botched smuggling scheme. No need to thank me."" In the above cases, your regional reputation will increase by 100 points after you make the delivery. Giving the contraband to either contact is the only way to acquire this reputation gain. Alternatively, if the time limit runs out before you make the delivery to either party, a message pops up: (Employer's name) isn't going to be happy about you holding on to the (contraband), but it's too late to deliver it anywhere. You might be able to sell it somewhere ... Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] A successfully completed quest results in a reputation gain according to the table below.

In addition, if you do not deliver the drugs, your loss of regional reputation will be irreversible. Enemies[edit] One Knight at the first contact location if it was a set up"

I have a small matter that you are ideally suited for. As always, my servants will test your mettle. Feel free to dispense with them. They can always be raised again.

I am looking for the answer to a question. It doesn't exist among the living, but may exist among the dead. I want you to bring me back the ghost of Prince Karolis, the great grandfather of the late King Camaron of Sentinel. Karolis was a sorcerer of no mean skill. He is now a lich deep in the bowels of the Castle. I am giving you a special Scarab. If it is close to him when you destroy his physical body, his soul will be trapped in the Scarab. Bring it back to me, and I will tell you a tale few mortals have heard."" Finding the Lich[edit] The palace dungeons contain various humanoid enemies such as archers and spellswords, as well as Orcs and wraiths. If you follow the walkthrough below, however, you will encounter very few enemies.   Starting from the throne room, take the first door to the south. The door may be locked, so you should come prepared. Using force to open it is not a good idea, since there are several knights in the throne room who will attack you if you attempt to break open the door. Once the door is open, walk south until you come to an elevator and use it to go up.   Once you reach the upper level, follow the hallway.   Follow the hallway until the walls change color and dungeon music begins to play.   Follow the stairs down until you come to a door. Continue east past this door (not through it), and continue past an intersection, then turn north and head west at a second intersection. Follow the hallway north until it curves around to the east.   Walk down the hall through an open doorway and go south.   Continue south until you reach an elevator. Ride it to the first opening and follow the hallway to a room. Pull the lever in this room and return to the elevator. Get on the elevator and ride it to the top.   From the top of the elevator, go west and enter a room with numerous blue force fields blocking the doorways. Your target is behind one of these doors, but first you must disable the force fields. Go through the southwest door and ride the elevator to the bottom.   There is a lever at the bottom next to the elevator, but don't pull it or a door further along will be blocked. At the east end of the hallway is a wraith trapped behind a blue force field; dispose of it while it is trapped. Ride the south elevator up to the second  opening.   Go around the corner, killing the spider, to find another elevator. Ride this elevator up.   From the top of the elevator, go east.   Follow the hallway north and you will reach a lever. Pull it and return to the elevator.   From the elevator, go north through the room with the blue force fields and leave through the second door to the north. Take the elevator down.   Go south and enter the room with a pair of torture instruments and a ghost in the small chamber to the southwest. Pull the lever in this room and take the elevator back up.   Head south to the elevator and ride it down.   Go around the corner, where the spider was killed, and ride the other elevator down.   The force field which previously trapped the wraith will now be gone, giving you access to another lever. Pull this lever to dispel the force field blocking access to the lich. Ride either of the elevators in this room and return to the room with the force fields.   The doorway to the lich is now accessible.   Prince Karolis, the lich of Sentinel Follow the hallway down to the second room at the end of the hallway. Destroy the lich to trap Prince Karolis' soul in the scarab the King of Worms gave you.    From the force field room, backtrack to the entrance of the castle dungeons; the castle guards will not attack you on sight.  Additional Information[edit] After bringing the scarab with the prince's soul to the King of Worms, he will say: ""Well done (player's first name). I am sure the prince will be most cooperative. Please accept this (magical item) as a token of my appreciation. In addition, I have decided that it is time for someone outside of Tiber Septim's line to know the truth about the Underking. As you know, Tiber Septim was the first emperor of Tamriel. Toward the end of his wars of conquest, he betrayed his Battlemage, Zurin Arctus. When Zurin died, his soul refused to leave his body. Something to do with the mysterious Numidium. Since that time Zurin Arctus has lived on as the Underking. The Underking and his agents have been a thorn in my side for centuries. Just remember, should the Underking regain his mortal body, he would surely throw all of Tamriel into conflict.""

They would be willing to pay (random gold) gold pieces for it, which would be yours. All we want is the regard of the Mages Guild. The journey will not be an easy one. Are you interested?"" Accept[edit] The beldam goes on: ""Very good, (player's first name). Here is the potion. Now, you should be safe during the day, for those who want it strictly travel by night. They are expecting the potion at the Mages Guild of (town) in (time limit) days or less, so tarry not. Ask for a mage by the name of (mage's name)."" Decline[edit] The beldam answers: ""I understand. I'm disappointed, but I understand."" Children of the Night[edit] This is a very special potion indeed; although it only appears as ""Pure water"" in your inventory, the potion is a universal remedy which cures both lycanthropy and vampirism. You can use the mixture to cure your own afflictions, and the potion does not get used up if you do so. However, even the small amount you sample has an effect as you receive the message: You feel strange. Until you deliver the potion, every being that wants it will be after you. You will be safe during daytime, but as soon as night falls you will be hunted mercilessly by lycanthropes and vampires unless you are in fast-travel mode. They will chase you the whole night until dawn, from 17:21 to 06:39. This means you can neither rest nor enter fast-travel mode as long as they are after you; you can only fight them or run. Since they come in great numbers, fighting is a rather tiresome affair. There can be a maximum of seven vampires, ten wereboars and twelve werewolves altogether. However, if you start the quest during daytime, and travel cautiously to your destination, you can avoid your pursuers completely as you will also arrive during the daytime. When the very first night falls three messages pop up, one from each of the three following groups, at random: Vampires: A voice gritty with the dirt of the grave hisses, ""You! That potion belongs to us!"" ""Give me the potion,"" somebody snarls. ""It doesn't belong to you!"" You hear someone howl an unnatural, savage cry of desire. ""The potion! The potion!"" Werewolves: The howl of a wolf sounds out. You hear something snarl a piteous cry of yearning. The cry of a wolf pierces the night. It is not a howl of hunger, but of yearning. Wereboars: The high-pitched shriek of a boar pierces the night. You hear the guttural snarl of a boar, its timbre shaking in desperation. The still night suddenly breaks with the high-pitched snarl of an angry boar. Head for the specified town, and locate and enter the Mages Guild. Find the mage who ordered the mixture to complete your quest. Reward[edit] Speak to your contact to hand the potion over. If you did nothing with the mixture, the mage says: ""Ah, a most rare and wondrous formula. Here are your (random gold) gold pieces. A bargain price for this potion."" However, if you sampled the potion (whether or not you were afflicted with either lycanthropy or vampirism) the mage will immediately detect something is wrong: ""What's this? The formula has been desecrated! I am disappointed that you cannot do this one simple thing for me."" You will not get a reward in this case, and will fail the quest.

The thief's full schedule is as follows: From 00:00 to 10:00, the thief will be at home. From 10:01 to 18:00, the thief will be at a Thieves Guild hangout. From 18:01 to 19:00, the thief visits his or her mistress. From 19:01 to 00:00, the thief will be at a tavern. The target is most vulnerable while visiting the mistress' residence, as no bodyguards will be present and the thief will not employ any Shield spells for protection.

Choose whether to retrieve the gem, kill the cousin, or kill the former lover. Travel back to your employer within the time limit and collect your reward.","Cheating Heart[edit] The Merchant or Innkeeper quest giver says: ""Imagine the purity of my delight when my sniveling, cheating lover of the past two years was abducted and presumably killed. Then imagine my despair when I discovered that the [sic] (lover's description) was still among the living. Next, imagine my amusement when (his/her) kidnappers demanded a ransom.

Accept[edit] The merchant or innkeeper goes on: ""(Oath), (oath), and (oath). The way I see it, there are three ways to stop this ransoming. One is to make sure that dear (lover's name) accidentally dies before the ransom date in (time limit) days. Of course, I don't know where (he/she) is, so that's a difficult one. The next option is to see to (his/her) cousin's accidental death within the same time frame. Now, (cousin's name), that's the cousin, lives in (dungeon), which is a well-fended fortress. So there's a difficulty there. Finally, you could remove the (gem) from (cousin's dungeon) that (cousin's name) plans to use for the ransom.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Totem,_Totem,_Who_Gets_the_Totem%3F","Receive a letter from Lady Brisienna. Meet with her and hear her plea. Go to Castle Daggerfall and find the Totem of Tiber Septim in the Treasury. Give the Totem to one of the powers in the Iliac Bay. Receive a message from Nulfaga in your mind. Meet the old sorceress at Castle Shedungent in the Wrothgarian Mountains.","An Urgent Matter[edit] After you have completed the Lysandus' Revenge, Soul of a Lich, and Orcish Emancipation quests, you receive a letter: A cheerful young woman hands you a letter and then walks away, whistling. Check your inventory for the letter. It is from Lady Brisienna, and reads: (Player's name),  Come at once to (town) in  (region). I will be waiting at  (tavern) for you. The fate  of the empire could be at stake.  -- Lady Brisienna The region where Lady Brisienna's current town is located depends on which of the three required quests you completed as the last. Head to this town and locate the tavern named in the letter. Enter it and speak to her. Lady Brisienna Returns[edit] Upon your arrival, Lady Brisienna tells you: ""(Player's first name), I'm glad you could meet me here. The Blades and your emperor need you again. You may or may not be aware that the Totem of Tiber Septim has been found. For a brief time Lord Woodborne of Wayrest had it. Where he got it from is still a mystery. The Blades mounted an assault upon Woodborne Hall to retrieve it. Although the Hall fell, many of our number fell with it. We sacked the Woodborne Hall, but the Totem was gone. I have reason to believe that Gothryd has the Totem. The Blades no longer have the men to mount an assault on Castle Daggerfall. You have shown yourself to be quite adept at getting in and out of these places. Would you go into Castle Daggerfall and retrieve the Totem of Tiber Septim?"" Accept, and she replies: ""I knew I could count on you (player's first name). The Totem is most likely in the Daggerfall treasury. It is a huge room, quite unmistakable. I am leaving in a couple of days. I shall send word to you where you can meet me after you get the Totem. Should you succeed, the Emperor has instructed me to gift you with an artifact of great power and renown. Warlock's Ring! If you have read Lord Woodborne's diary, you know that he and Gothryd had been associates for some time due to some common interests. While Brisienna asks you to get the Totem and bring it to her, at the same time five other people are also very interested in gaining possession of it. They are the Underking, Gortwog, King Eadwyre, Queen Akorithi, and the King of Worms. If they like you, they will send you letters promising great rewards if you give them the Totem. If they don't like you, they will send thugs to steal it once you get out of Castle Daggerfall. Finding the Totem[edit]  Go through the southwest door of the throne room and follow the hallway. Head through the door and you will enter a room with an archer. Leave the room through the north door, which will be locked. Go through the door in the small room and you will reach a huge room with a central tower and various crossroads.   You must reach the top platform of the central tower. The easiest way is to levitate up there, but you can also go up the stairs in the central tower. There will be many archers in this huge room. Once you have reached the top platform, follow the causeway north and exit through the north door.   You will find yourself again in a big room. Follow the ledge west and go north past a knight.   Go through the east door at the end of the ledge. There will be an enemy in the hallway next to a door, at the bottom of a ramp. Go through that door and you will be in the treasury vault of Castle Daggerfall.   The treasury is a giant cube with 12 chambers hovering in the air and numerous knights and battlemages in the surrounding room. There are many treasures in this cube, and the Totem will also be found in one of its chambers. But first, you must sink it to the ground. To do this, go to the very bottom of this huge room, a square pit filled knee-deep with water and some slaughterfish.   At the bottom are two passages at each cardinal direction. The southwest passage leads to a room with a slaughterfish and three chains. Pulling the right chain will cast a water-breathing spell on you. The middle chain will teleport you to a ledge at the top of the vault. The left chain will teleport you also to the top of the vault but in mid-air. Each chain can be used only once. The southeast passage leads to a room flooded with water. There will be an ice atronach and a handwheel in this room. Turning the handwheel will sink the giant cube. However, it will now cover the pit, so you must use one of the chains to get out.   The Totem of Tiber Septim Once you are out of the pit, go to the top of the cube. There is a lever in the center; pulling it will lower the blue bars that block entry into some of the treasury's chambers. The totem can be found in the middle chamber of the northwest corner, lying on a pedestal. Pick it up and make your escape. If you haven't set a Recall anchor, you must make your way back through the dungeon and throne room. Beware, as all the throne room guards will now be hostile and engage you on sight. Leave the castle quickly to avoid unnecessary encounters. Note: after you have picked up the Totem, it is advised that you not speak to King Gothryd until you have fully exited the castle (see bugs).  Setting Events In Motion[edit] Shortly after you pick up the Totem, it will speak to you in your mind: A voice in your head intones... ""You are (player's name). You are my new host. Know this now and resolutely. You are not worthy to carry the Totem of Tiber Septim. Only those of his blood line may carry me. I will give you a year and a day to accomplish this."" The Totem's warning means that only someone of royal blood may wield it; those worthy of this are King Gothryd, Queen Akorithi, King Eadwyre, Gortwog, the Underking, the King of Worms, and Emperor Uriel Septim VII. You have one year and one day to decide who to give the Totem to. Otherwise, it will abandon you for a new owner. After you acquire the Totem, you can potentially receive a letter from each major faction in the Iliac Bay, except Gothryd, provided you have a high enough reputation with them. Gothryd will simply send his men after you as soon as you leave Castle Daggerfall with the Totem, regardless of your reputation with him. The reputations required to gain each respective letter are as follows: Person Reputation Required   Akorithi 5 or more   Eadwyre 15 or more   Gortwog 10 or more   Gothryd No letter   The King of Worms Zero or more   The Underking Zero or more   Brisienna (Uriel VII) Any Each letter sender promises you a great reward if you present them with the Totem. Decide who is worthy to bear the Totem, it is entirely your decision. Essentially, this decision determines which faction will ""win"" in the end, so choose wisely. If the quest is still active and your reputation with a specific faction drops below the threshold needed to receive their letter, that individual will send their minions after you to take the Totem by force. This also happens automatically if you exit Castle Daggerfall with the Totem and your reputation is already below the threshold needed to receive the faction's letter. This is permanent; if you raise your reputation with an attacking faction above the letter threshold, they will not stop attacking and you will not receive a letter. Taking Sides[edit] Queen Akorithi[edit] If you receive a letter from Akorithi: A page dressed in the livery of Sentinel hands you a letter, and silently walks away. Her letter reads: (Player's name),  You are on a quest to retrieve the Totem of  Tiber Septim. Do not deny it. My spies have  confirmed this. The Totem is not for commoners,  and you cannot use it. Bring the Totem to me  and I will pay you 100,000 gold pieces.  It is a king's ransom by any measure.  You should be warned, neither Wayrest nor  Daggerfall are loyal to the throne. I am the  only regent on the Iliac Bay that can be trusted.  The others will only use it to destroy me. Akorithi Queen of Sentinel Head to Castle Sentinel and speak to the queen to present her with the Totem. Akorithi says: ""The Totem of Tiber Septim! It is a priceless artifact. I shall guard it well and keep the rebellious powers of Daggerfall and Wayrest in check. Take your reward (player's first name). You have earned it ten fold. You must keep your keen eyes open for the Mantella. Any rumors must be hunted down with vigor. Without the Mantella, the Totem is useless."" King Eadwyre[edit] If you receive a letter from Eadwyre: A portly man bearing the standard of Wayrest approaches you with a letter. His somber expression never changes, and he speaks not a word. He leaves as silently as he arrived. His letter reads: Noble (player's name),  My ears have picked up rumors that you are  searching for the Totem of Tiber Septim. I  too have hunted for this wondrous artifact  for many years. Should you find it, I would  pay you a healthy ransom, enough to buy your  own ship. I will match or exceed any price  that Gothryd or Akorithi might offer. Never  forget your real friends. King Eadwyre, of Wayrest Head to Castle Wayrest and speak to the king to present him with the Totem. Eadwyre takes the Totem and sneers: ""Fool! Did you really think I would pay you for the Totem? Kill the (player's race)!"" The castle guards immediately become hostile, and Eadwyre's battlemages begin appearing to attack you. Make a quick exit. Gortwog[edit] If you receive a letter from Gortwog: A heavily cloaked figure shuffles toward you. As you prepare to defend yourself, a gnarled green hand shoots forth with a letter. Stunned, you do nothing as the figure shuffles away. His letter reads: (Player's name),  You are not orcish. How could you possibly  understand what it is like? My people are  treated like barbarians. Slaughtered upon  sight. Is it so unusual that we respond in  kind? Violence begets violence.  I aspire to raise my race from the mire. I  will bring them to equal standing with the  other races of Tamriel. To do this I must  have the Totem of Tiber Septim. I will not  insult you by promises that no blood will  be shed. I do swear by my crown and by my  heirs I shall not attempt to hold sway  beyond the borders of Orsinium. My goal is  not to conquer Tamriel, but to create the  orcish homeland. I am in possession of an  artifact that I am sure you would want to  possess. It is yours if you but give me  the Totem of Tiber Septim. -- Gortwog, Warlord and King Head to Orsinium and enter the fortress. Speak to the Gortwog to present him with the Totem, and he responds: ""A nation of Orcs is within my grasp. You have given my people a chance at freedom, (player's name). Should you ever recover the Mantella itself, I shall reward you thrice over for it."" King Gothryd[edit] Gothryd doesn't send a letter. Instead, he sends his knights to take the Totem by force. When you hit the first of these minions, you will be given an ultimatum: ""Hand over the Totem, or we'll slaughter you where you stand. Well? Are you going to give it to us, or make us take it from you?"" Refuse, and the knights resume attacking with the reply: ""Then we'll just have to take it."" Hand over the Totem, and be told: ""Coward. Now get lost. Oh yeah. I was told you should go see Nalfuga [sic], whoever that is."" If you agree to surrender the Totem but are not currently in possession of it, the knight grows angry: ""You don't even have it! Now I'm going to kill you just for the fun of it."" If you surrender the Totem to the knights, you will not receive a reward. However, if you head to Castle Daggerfall and present the Totem to King Gothryd directly, he will give you a reward and say: ""I see you have come to your senses. I should have you slain, but I have more honor than that. Instead I shall reward you. Here take 10,000 gold pieces for your turnabout loyalty. Deliver the Mantella to me, and my trust in you will be once again restored."" The King of Worms[edit] If you receive a letter from the King of Worms: A hand grips your wrist from behind. Spinning, you open your mouth to shout for the guards. A skeletal hand stuffs a letter into your mouth. The heavily robed skeleton releases your wrist and turns away, unnoticed by other passerby. His letter reads: (Player's name),  You will soon have the Totem of Tiber Septim  in your hands. It is forseen in the stars,  and I have read them. Know you this. All of  mortal stature are filled with pride and greed.  To give the Totem to any of them is to let  loose mortal vanity upon this world. They will  destroy the very thing they covet.     I have no earthly desires. I have no mortal  pride, no petty greed. Only one such as I  can wield the Totem safely, for I would take  it into the Aetherius and leave behind this  earthly shell. So long as the Totem exists,  it is a danger to all on Tamriel. Bring me  the Totem and I will safeguard the world.     I will not offer you gold or gems. I will  offer you what only I can give. Fame. Your  reputation throughout Tamriel will soar. Lord of the Necromancers, King of the Worms Head to Scourg Barrow and speak to the Necromancer to present him with the Totem. The King of Worms exclaims: ""The Totem! At last it is within my grasp. You have done well, (player's first name). I shall remember this when I have transformed. Search now for the Mantella. Without it, the Totem is worthless. In the mean time, enjoy the adoration of the world."" For information on this reward, see the chart below. The Underking[edit] If you receive a letter from the Underking: A letter floats through the air toward you. Strangely, nobody else seems to notice it. The letter tucks inself [sic] into your pack. His letter reads: (Player's name),  Centuries ago, Tiber Septim ruled the land  and forged an empire with great Numidium. The  secret of Numidium's power lies in its heart,  carried within the Mantella. It is the heart  of Tiber Septim's battlemage. It is my heart. It  is my Mantella. It is my Totem. It belongs to  me, and to none other.  I have won and lost an empire. I have no desire  to tamper further with mortal affairs. I have in  my possession Necromancer's Amulet, one of the  world's greatest artifacts. You may have it in  in [sic] exchange for the Totem.  My most loyal agent will await your arrival in  (regional temple) of (region), at (temple). Underking Head to the temple, then find and speak to the Agent to present the Underking with the Totem. The Agent tells you: ""The Underking will be most pleased. He has searched many life times for this lost item. I have been instructed to give you this object. Use it wisely. Should you ever locate the Mantella, the Underking would be most appreciative."" Uriel Septim VII[edit] To give the Totem to the emperor, you must go through Lady Brisienna. Her letter appears in your inventory without a delivery notification. It reads: (Player's name),  If you are reading this, you must have gotten  the Totem and escaped from the dungeons of  Castle Daggerfall. I am in (new town),  of (region) at (building).  Bring the Totem there as soon as possible. -- Lady Brisienna Head to this new location and speak to Brisienna to present the Totem to Emperor Uriel VII. She tells you: ""Your Emperor will be most grateful. The Totem could have started a civil war in the wrong hands. Thank you (player's first name). Now you must away to Nulfaga. She holds the key to the Mantella. Free the Mantella, and the Emperor controls Great Numidium through the Totem."" Reward[edit] Your reward depends on which individual you choose to give the Totem of Tiber Septim to: Person Reward   Akorithi 100,000 gold.   Eadwyre Promises gold, but instead sends his battlemages after you.   Gortwog Originally Warlock's Ring; as of the latest official patch, the intended reward is Chrysamere.Due to a bug, you will get nothing regardless of which version is installed (see bugs).   Gothryd 10,000 gold.   The King of Worms Fame. However, this does not work and you receive nothing (see bugs).   The Underking Necromancer's Amulet.   Brisienna Warlock's Ring. Once the Totem of Tiber Septim is in the hands of a worthy bearer, you receive a vision: The unmistakable voice of Nulfaga speaks softly in your head, ""I see that the Totem has found its way into the hands of someone with royal blood. I think it is time you paid me another visit here in Shedungent (player's name). Your work is not yet done."" Prepare yourself and head to Castle Shedungent, where Nulfaga waits to send you off on the final part of the Main Quest. Reputation Gain/Loss[edit] The only reputation changes awarded by this quest come from the King of Worms' reward: Fame Given By the King of Worms[edit] If you give the Totem to the King of Worms, you are supposed to get a lot of reputation.

(Lover's name) and I have had ... an understanding, but (his/her) lover is being distressingly old-fashioned about it. I have been challenged to a duel.

Not that most of (region) hasn't been with old (lover's name) first. Basically, I need someone like you to impersonate me in the duel. Would (random gold) gold pieces interest you in this?""

I'll expect you back in (time limit) days, victorious, for your just reward. Good luck, my friend."" Decline[edit] The merchant or innkeeper answers: ""No? That is too bad. Well, I probably should get someone who looks more like me anyhow."" Pusillanimous Paramours[edit] The competitor is preparing for the duel by hiding in a tavern and drinking The spellsword will fight you to the death The object of gutless affections  This is an easy and straightforward quest, which can be done in either of two ways: If you wish to defend your craven employer's honor, head to the building where the competitor is staying. Your employer gave you a letter when you accepted the quest; you must have this letter in your inventory when you speak to the competitor in order to issue the challenge. It reads: ""I, (employer's name) of (town), do hereby answer your challenge. As is my right by the formal rules of combat, I will call the place where we shall meet. That place is here and the time is now. This contract is legally binding.  To refuse to meet its challenge without formal apology is to sacrifice honor evermore. (Employer's name) of (town) The competitor proves to be just as spineless as your employer and delays starting the duel, saying: ""You're, uh, (employer's name)? You must be looking for the other person named (competitor's name), a real tough, uh, (Spellsword). You'll find (him/her) in (residence). Good luck, (employer's name). I hope you win!"" or ""If you're (employer's name) ... (Oath), I'll meet you over in (residence). Let me just, ah, get into my (Spellsword) clothes. Bye!"" The competitor will then run off somewhere. Find the residence by asking around. The building may be locked, so be prepared with an Open spell if you don't want to pick the lock yourself. When you gain access to the house, a message appears: You're in (residence), where (competitor's name) said (he/she) would meet you. Search the house for your opponent and you will encounter a spellsword. In case you didn't pick up on the clues, your opponent is an impersonator, just like you. Fight the duel; when you kill the enemy, a message appears that spells it all out for you: In the guise of (employer's name), you have slain a (Spellsword) in the guise of (competitor's name). You have merely to return to your employer and honor is restored. As it says, return to your employer to restore honor and collect your reward Alternatively, instead of seeking out the competitor you can go straight to the lover and avoid all the nonsense. Ask around town and you will eventually learn where to find the object of the rivals' affections. Head there and speak to the lover, who will react in one of three ways: ""This is preposterous! On one hand, (competitor's name) is a perfect boor to challenge (employer's name) to a duel. On the other, what a perfect coward (employer's name) is for sending you in (his/her) place. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Neither shall have me, but you may have (lover's gold) gold pieces since that fool promised to pay you."" ""This is too romantic! Just imagine -- (competitor's name) and (employer's name) tearing each other to pieces over little me. (Oath), as thoughtful a gesture as that is, I cannot let it be. I will leave (town) forever, but first, please accept (lover's gold) gold pieces to replace that which (employer's name) offered you. I can't let you be poor just because no duel will occur. Fare thee well, (player's first name)."" ""Let me get this straight. That idiotic (competitor's name) is jealous of me and (employer's name) and has challenged (him/her) to a duel. And that infernal coward (employer's name) has sent you to pretend to be (him/her) in this duel? Is it any wonder that I don't love either of them? I'll take care of this. Here's (lover's gold) gold pieces instead of what (employer's name) offered you. There will be no duel. If you tell the lover what is going on, the quest will count as a failure; you will lose two reputation with your employer's faction. However, the gold reward will be a bit larger than what your employer offers, and you won't need to duel anyone to collect it. Reward[edit] After returning to your employer after a successful duel, he/she will say: ""Honor is restored, eh, my fine (player's race)? Here's your (random gold) gold pieces.

https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Outlaws_from_the_West,Chapter_1:_Colter,"Half frozen, close to death, and on the run, the Van der Linde gang find shelter in an old abandoned mining town. Dutch, Arthur, and Micah head out to look for supplies.","Following a failed ferry robbery in Blackwater and the Van der Linde gang's subsequent escape into a snowstorm in Ambarino, the gang is barely holding on, with an injured Davey Callander on the verge of death. Arthur Morgan subsequently appears and informs Dutch of an abandoned settlement where they can stay for the time being. As the gang arrives, they rush Davey into a cabin where he succumbs to his wounds. In response, Dutch gives a motivational speech pushing the gang to stay strong and turn Colter into a temporary camp. He informs the gang that he and Arthur will go scouting for food and supplies, then subsequently leave the cabin.
Arthur and Dutch go scouting for supplies and any sign of Micah or John Marston, who were sent to do the same. They soon encounter Micah, who tells them about a nearby homestead and leads them to it. As they arrive, Arthur hides behind a cattle shed and Micah hides behind a wagon whilst Dutch goes to speak to the people inside the house.
As Dutch is speaking, posing as a lone traveler lost on the trail, Micah notices a body in the wagon and alerts Arthur, who tries to calm Micah down and remind him that Dutch should be the main focus. The men in the house, who turn out to be members of the rival O'Driscoll Boys gang, begin to threaten Dutch, ultimately leading to a shootout between Arthur, Dutch, and Micah against said O'Driscolls.
Once the shootout is over, Dutch tells Arthur to help him search the cabin for supplies. Arthur finds food and ammunition, along with clues of what happened. He may find a pool of blood on the floor along with a photograph of the previous inhabitants of the cabin, a husband and wife.
As Arthur finishes searching, Dutch tells him to search the barn for anything of use there. Arthur enters the barn and is ambushed by an O'Driscoll who jumps on him from the loft above. A brawl ensues, which Dutch observes in amusement as Arthur easily subdues his opponent. Once the O'Driscoll is defeated, Dutch tells Arthur to beat information out of him. The O'Driscoll informs Arthur of an O'Driscoll hideout southwest from their location, by a lake, and also hints at a train robbery they were planning. Once he's talked, Dutch gives Arthur the choice of sparing or killing the O'Driscoll, or Arthur can simply knock him out unconscious. If the player lets him go, he'll appear in a later mission only to be killed.
There is a Tennessee Walker inside the barn which Arthur must calm. Dutch then tells Arthur to lead the horse to a hitching post outside the house, and that Arthur should keep the horse. As they do so, a commotion is heard inside the house, caused by Micah taunting a frightened woman, who had been hiding in the cellar. The woman is terrified, throwing plates and knives at Micah, who is only amused. Amidst the chaos and Dutch attempted to calm down Micah and the woman, the house catches on fire from a knocked lantern. Dutch gently disarms the woman, whose name is Sadie Adler, and calms her down. He offers to bring Sadie back with them, keeping her safe. The four then return to Colter as the house burns down."
"https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Enter,_Pursued_by_a_Memory",Chapter_1:_Colter,John Marston has not returned from an earlier scouting trip. Arthur Morgan and Javier Escuella ride out into the snow to look for him.,"Abigail Roberts is concerned with the safety of John Marston, who hasn't been seen in two days since going on a scouting mission. She asks Arthur and Javier to find him. Arthur is noticeably reluctant, but agrees to go with Javier to retrieve him after being persuaded by Hosea Matthews.
Arthur and Javier ride together, and soon Javier spots a camp in the distance and speeds up. After riding for a while, the pair come across John's horse, frozen and mauled to death. Javier fires his gun to see if John hears, and in the distance, he can be heard calling out for help.
Arthur and Javier leave their horses and continue on foot, climbing around several ledges. They find an injured and bloody John and carry him back to the horses. As the three arrive to their horses, they are attacked by three wolves, which Arthur kills on the way.
As Javier and Arthur ride back down, Javier spots another group of wolves and spurs his horse into a gallop. Arthur kills the wolves and there are no more wolf attacks for the rest of the journey. Upon arriving at the gang's camp, John is carried inside by Bill Williamson and Lenny Summers, whilst Abigail berates him."
https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/The_Aftermath_of_Genesis,Chapter_1:_Colter,,"Pearson informs Arthur that the camp is very low on food, and that soon people will begin to starve. Arthur and Charles decide to go hunting for food, and ride for a while before stopping to track an animal.
Arthur follows Charles for a while, and when Charles picks up a trail, Arthur goes to his horse to get his bow. The pair then stealthily follow the deer trail, trying not to scare the deer. They find it and Arthur kills it with his bow.
Arthur tracks a second deer and kills it, then puts the carcass on his horse whilst Charles puts the carcass of the first deer on his. As they are traveling, they encounter a bear roaming around. Charles advises Arthur to keep out of the way, despite there being more meat on the bear. It is up to the player whether they may try to kill the bear or not. Afterwards, they take the deer to Pearson's butcher's station and Arthur skins it."
https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Friends,Chapter_1:_Colter,"Looking for information on the O'Driscolls' planned train job, Dutch leads the gang to attack their camp at Ewing Basin.","Arthur enters the men's shack at Colter and finds Micah Bell and Bill Williamson arguing. The fight almost turns violent before Dutch enters and scolds Bill and Micah, saying that Colm O'Driscoll is the one who needs hitting. As the gang members head to their horses, Arthur asks if attacking their long-time rivals is right given the gang's current state. Dutch tells Arthur to stop doubting him and says that they need more information if they want to hit the train the O'Driscolls were planning to rob. Dutch gives Arthur a Carbine Repeater and a lasso and the gang set out.
On the way, Dutch sees hoofprints in the snow and they follow them. He reminds the others about his hate towards Colm after he killed Dutch's lover Annabelle and how their rivalry began after Dutch killed Colm's brother in retaliation. The gang soon reach a cliff edge overlooking the O'Driscoll camp. Dutch assigns different positions to Micah, Bill, Javier Escuella and Lenny Summers before he and Arthur scope out the camp. Using binoculars, they see Colm on his horse, shouting at and hitting one of his men, who then leaves on horseback in fear. Colm follows suit, but Dutch decides that they shouldn't deal with him yet. Dutch and Arthur slowly creep down towards the camp unseen, during which Dutch reassures Arthur that this is not a revenge mission, merely a way to find more food and supplies.
After taking cover in the camp, the player has the option of firing the first shot themselves or let Dutch do it instead. Regardless, the gang engage the O'Driscolls in a gunfight and soon defeat them. As they search the bodies, a gunshot erupts from the woods as more O'Driscolls attack. After dealing with them, the gang search the camp; Micah finds some plans for the train robbery and Arthur finds some explosives in one of the buildings. Their mission accomplished, the gang members begin their ride home. Dutch congratulates his men on a job well done and proudly tells them that they will always be one step ahead of their enemies, outsmart them and never be beaten.
As it gets dark, Dutch sees the same O'Driscoll Colm assaulted earlier standing ahead of them. The O'Driscoll panics and rides off, so Arthur chases him and easily catches up before hogtieing the man and putting him on his horse. Arthur then heads back to camp with the O'Driscoll, whose name is Kieran Duffy, whimpering and begging for mercy the whole way.
Back at Colter, Arthur brings Kieran to Dutch, who tells Bill and Uncle to tie their captive up in the barn and starve him, despite Kieran insisting that he hates the O'Driscolls. Dutch congratulates Arthur and assures him they will get Colm eventually."
https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Who_the_Hell_is_Leviticus_Cornwall%3F,Chapter_1:_Colter,"In need of money, and with the plans and explosives stolen from the O'Driscoll's camp, the gang rides out to rob Leviticus Cornwall's private train.","After reaching the train, Bill goes out to set the explosives, and Arthur goes to help him. They set up the explosives, and sit back for the gang waiting for it to go off. Unfortunately, the explosives do not work and the gang goes after it on horseback. Lenny and Arthur jump aboard the train, while Javier falls and is wounded when he misses the jump.
Once on the train, Lenny and Arthur advance through the train in order to stop it. Arthur stops the train and a shootout commences between the train guards and Arthur and Lenny. After the shootout ends with the guards getting killed, the rest of the gang catches up to them. They find the train car with the bonds inside as well as employees that have locked themselves inside. Dutch attempts to persuade them to open the door, but the attempt fails and so they resort to using dynamite to open the door.
Once opened, the employees are forced out at gunpoint, so Arthur, Lenny and Micah go inside to look for the bonds. Arthur eventually finds them, and once outside, Dutch lets Arthur decide whether to spare or kill the passengers. This choice does not affect the story or mission in any way - it only affects the player's honor."
https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Eastward_Bound,Chapter_1:_Colter,"With renewed strength and the weather finally stable, the gang rides down from the mountains to set up camp at Horseshoe Overlook.","After the gang decides to move east to Horseshoe Overlook, Arthur gets on a wagon with Hosea, and the rest of the gang gets on wagons and horses for the ride.
After crossing a stream, one of the wheels on Arthur's and Hosea's wagon falls off. Charles, who was riding with Bill, stays back with them to help. While putting the wheel back on, Hosea points out that some Native Americans are watching them from a nearby cliff. After fixing the wagon, they continue on the path to Horseshoe Overlook."

He finds him beyond intoxicated, playing poker with two men named Luther and Marvin. After he passes out, Luther asks Arthur to play the Reverend's hand.
If Arthur does, he will play poker with the men until either one of them busts out, until five hands have been played, or if the player decides to simply leave the game. Arthur gets up to leave, and notices that Swanson has gone.
Arthur searches for him, and finds him being beaten by a man. Arthur fights the man and defeats him, then chases after a nearby shepherd, who had seen the fight, and stops him from getting the law. The Reverend is then seen on the railway bridge, and has gotten his foot stuck in the tracks. Arthur runs onto the bridge and barely manages to save him from a passing train, after which Swanson apologises to Arthur for all the trouble he caused and passes out again. Arthur takes Swanson back to camp, and leaves him in his tent to sleep it off."

Dutch says that Micah told him of a good hideout spot at Dewberry Creek, and sends Arthur and Charles to check it out.
Upon reaching the dried-up creek, the pair notes it's a poor spot and they find a dead body in the riverbed. They soon find a small camp nearby and a German family hiding under a wagon. The family could hardly speak English. However, the daughter managed to communicate that the father had been kidnapped. Arthur doesn't want to look for him, but Charles convinces him, and the two ride off to search for the man.
They follow a horse trail and reach a clearing by Flat Iron Lake. They find the father tied up, but are attacked by bandits. Once the assault has been put down, Arthur unties the man and takes him back to his family. While riding back, he tells Arthur (in German) his family runs a gold mining business, and he was being held for ransom. Arthur doesn't understand what the man is saying. On returning to his family, the man gives Arthur a gold bar as a token of appreciation for rescuing him.

Arthur and Hosea then set out for Grizzlies East, where a Legendary Bear is located north of O'Creagh's Run. On the way, the two make camp and cook rabbit.

After selling the sheep, Arthur, John, Dutch and Strauss are confronted by Leviticus Cornwall and his henchmen, which turns into a shootout.","Arthur meets with John in the south part of Valentine near the auction yard. John says that he has found a lead, and points out some sheep in a pen. He then tells Arthur to follow him to the gun store to buy a sniper rifle. As they walk through town, Arthur tells John about how returning to Blackwater is still too dangerous despite Dutch's talk and how the world is changing around them and believes they may be ""the last"". Once at the gun store, Arthur buys a Rolling Block Rifle, since John isn't on good terms with the gunsmith. Arthur then follows John on horseback towards the valley.
During the ride, the pair argue about John's family ways with Jack, during which Arthur advises John to ""not be two people at once"". John then tells Arthur his plan; to steal a herd of sheep heading from Emerald Ranch for sale and auction them. The pair head to the top of a cliff, where they see the herd passing below. Arthur follows John's instructions and shoots the ground to scare the ranch hands. Arthur and John then ride to the scattered sheep and round them up before leading them to the auction house, with Arthur directing the sheep due to John's inability to do so.
However, the auctioneer becomes suspicious of the sheep's origins and argues with Arthur. John will then negotiate his requested 25% share down to 18% to prevent him from snitching. Arthur and John then meet up with Dutch at the nearby Keane's saloon who is arguing with Strauss.
Dutch beckons Strauss and John to collect the payment on the sheep before asking Arthur to join him for a drink. Shortly thereafter, Leviticus Cornwall arrives with an entourage of private guards outside the saloon, demanding Dutch to show himself. He has John and Strauss held outside as hostages. Cornwall leaves before Dutch and Arthur confront the men, and Dutch vocally distracts them so Arthur can draw his gun and free John and Strauss. After the guards have been dispatched, a firefight will then ensue in the town. While making a run through the main street, Strauss is shot and the others are forced to grab a wagon to serve as cover and protect him. Once the group gets far enough, Arthur picks up Strauss and moves him to the back of John's horse.
Due to the skirmish in the town, Dutch decides that the gang will have to move camp again before fleeing with John and Strauss. Arthur stays behind and escapes Valentine and the law before heading back to camp at Horseshoe Overlook."

While they get on the wagon and ride out, the girls sing a song. As they near Valentine, the group encounter a man whose horses have fled from his wagon. Arthur can either help him get his horse back from nearby or refrain entirely; helping the man results in a small Honor boost, while refusing results in a small loss. Once they resume the ride, they reach Valentine, where the women explore the town in order to find any leads, while Arthur and Uncle buy supplies from the general store and have a few drinks before Arthur dozes off.
Afterward, Arthur is awakened by Mary-Beth, who informs Arthur of a train coming down through Scarlett Meadows, filled with rich tourists and laden with baggage. Arthur approves of the idea, and John later helps Arthur plan to rob it. Arthur then notices Tilly is being harassed by a man across the street. After sternly warning the man to leave, Arthur enters the Saints Hotel to find Karen. He finds her having been hit by a man she was attempting to steal from, who Arthur then takes care of.
After the group meets outside, a man asks Arthur if he was in Blackwater, as part of the failed ferry robbery. Arthur denies it, but the man doesn't believe him and rides off.

If he is saved, the man says that his name is Jimmy Brooks and thanks Arthur, who admits that he was in Blackwater recently. As thanks, Brooks gives Arthur a pen and rides away; the player will gain a significant amount of Honor accordingly. Alternatively, the player can stamp on his hand or refuse to help him and cause Brooks to fall to his death, causing a substantial loss of Honor.

His medicine is killing people, and Arthur is asked to bring him in alive. After finding Allbright, Allbright is initially suspicious that Arthur is a bounty hunter. Arthur pretends he is looking for medicine for his sick mother, and after being handed the medicine, he throws it in the water and aims his revolver at Allbright. Allbright claims he is a healer and can speak to spirits, and refuses to come in.
Arthur is forced to save his life after he nearly falls off the cliff, but Allbright is dismayed that Arthur still intends to bring him in. Allbright jumps into the water below, but gets caught in the current (if Arthur fails to pull him back up onto the cliff, he will fall into the river without the intervening cutscene). Arthur chases after him, and eventually catches him with his lasso, hogtying him. He transports Allbright to the sheriff's office, and collects the bounty."

They explain that they were dispatched to find the gang after the robbery of one of Leviticus Cornwall's trains near Granite Pass, and that they want Dutch. Arthur tries to play innocent, but Milton says that he has already seen the ""philosophy lesson"" from Mac Callander, whom he had captured and tortured to death after the skirmish in Blackwater. Arthur is infuriated and exchanges hostile words with Milton before the two agents leave.

Arthur is surprised to find Mary still willing to contact him after years of separation. He then goes to his tent to read the letter. After doing so, Arthur was noticeably lost in thoughts for a while. He can then proceed to find Mary at Chadwick Farm near Valentine.
When Arthur arrives at the farm and knocks at the door, an older woman opens up and points a gun at him. After Arthur states his business, she goes back into the house to inform Mary about his arrival. Afterward, she and Arthur have a short conversation before she asks him to check on her brother Jamie in Cumberland Forest, who has joined the Chelonians, a religious cult. She believes the cult is quite mad and will probably kill him.
The player can then decide if Arthur helps Mary or not. Choosing to help her will unlock the third part of the mission."

Arthur arrives at the Downes Ranch to reclaim the debt. He encounters Downes in the garden, and confronts him. Downes tries to hit him with a rake, but Arthur blocks it and intimidates Downes, who says he doesn't have the money. Arthur beats him and in the process, he coughs blood in Arthur's face. Arthur shrugs this off and continues demanding the money until Downes' wife notices what's happening and tells Arthur to leave, warning him that Thomas isn't well. Arthur rides back to camp and berates Strauss for lending them the money."
https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/A_Quiet_Time,Chapter_2:_Horseshoe_Overlook,Arthur takes Lenny for a quiet drink in Valentine to help calm him down after learning of Micah's arrest in Strawberry.,"Lenny arrives back at camp with the news that Micah was arrested in Strawberry for murder and that Sheriff Hanley is going to hang him. Dutch instructs Arthur to rescue Micah later and take Lenny into Valentine to calm him down. After arriving, the duo start drinking, until a patron named Jeb annoys the pair, and Arthur can either charm, intimidate, or assault him into leaving them alone. If the player does nothing, the charm button will automatically fill slowly until full.
After drinking some more, Arthur loses Lenny and begins looking for him, drunkenly stumbling around the saloon, and finds him upstairs, trying to balance a shot glass on his forehead (before dropping it over the railing, smashing it on the floor below). Reunited, the two start drinking again, but Arthur soon loses him again and after searching the bar a second time finds Lenny downstairs trying to fight off two men from atop the bar counter. Arthur confronts the men, but ends up drunkenly line dancing with the patrons of the bar. After relieving himself outside, Arthur returns to the bar to find Lenny for the third time, but he is so drunk and inebriated by this point that he sees every patron as Lenny (with jumbled-up button prompts and misspelled text to boot). After stumbling around, drunkenly yelling after Lenny and talking to three or more patrons, Lenny finds Arthur, and the pair engage in a slap fight before they return to drinking again. Jeb then re-enters the bar, and steals Arthur's drink out of his hand. This prompts Arthur to grab Jeb by the collar.
The game then cuts to Arthur and Lenny outside, holding Jeb over a water trough. At this point the player can do one of three things before a group of lawmen confront them to arrest the duo for their drunken shenanigans, leading to Lenny's arrest and Arthur fleeing, either escaping and fleeing the town or colliding with a barrel or tripping over a fence, falling over and being arrested as well. The option chosen will affect how the mission ends, with six different endings depending on what happens during these two moments.
Do nothing: if the player does not follow the button prompts to begin trying to drown Jeb in the water trough, he will break free and run away to retrieve the law.
Attempt to drown Jeb: if the player begins the button prompts to drown the patron, but doesn't complete it in time, Jeb breaks free and runs away, retrieving the law.
Drown Jeb: if the player completes the button prompt to drown Jeb, Arthur will drown Jeb until he is unconscious and then dump him onto the ground next to the trough, the law will then find Jeb there and begin searching for the pair.
Arthur escaped from the law, didn't force Jeb into the water trough: Arthur wakes up just south of the camp but is very hung over, gagging and vomiting onto the grass. He then returns to camp to find Lenny, who states he doesn't know what happened during their escape.
Arthur was arrested with Lenny, didn't force Jeb into water trough: Arthur and Lenny wake up in Valentine jail, charged with assault. After the pair post bail, they will pause outside the office, as Lenny vomits into the street, then go their separate ways back to camp.
Arthur escapes, attempted to drown Jeb: Arthur meets with Lenny back at camp, who was arrested and had to post bail for assault. Lenny then laments last night's events with Arthur, comparing it to Micah's actions in Strawberry.

Arthur is reluctant at first, but soon agrees. He heads over to Jack and greets him as he is playing in the grass. He invites Jack to come fishing with him. Jack seems interested, so Arthur mounts his horse and lifts Jack up so they can go. On the way, Jack asks Arthur if they are going back to the gang's previous campsite near Blackwater, as he left his Penny Dreadful storybook there. Arthur tells they can't go back, but promises to find Jack a new storybook.
Once at the river, the two start fishing, during which Jack decides to pick some flowers and make something. Once Arthur catches at least three fish, Jack shows him a necklace he made out of the flowers, and two Pinkertons interrupt. They introduce themselves as Agents Milton and Ross. They explain that they were dispatched to find the gang after the robbery of one of Leviticus Cornwall's trains near Granite Pass, and that they want Dutch. Arthur tries to play innocent, but Milton says that he has already seen the ""philosophy lesson"" from Mac Callander, whom he had captured and tortured to death after the skirmish in Blackwater. Arthur is infuriated and exchanges hostile words with Milton before the two agents leave.
On the way back to camp, Jack asks why Arthur lied about Dutch and what the agents said about Mac. Arthur hopes that Mac is ""fine where he is"" and tells Jack to not worry about the ""disagreeable men"". After returning Jack to Abigail, Arthur heads over to Dutch to tell him about Milton and Ross and asks what they should do. Dutch believes that the Pinkertons want to scare them, and decides that they should all do nothing and just stay calm."

He speaks to Sheriff Hanley, pretending to be a bounty hunter who is looking for the O'Driscolls, but Hanley refuses to release Micah. After exiting, Arthur hears Micah yelling. He goes to the window of his cell, and Micah asks if Arthur is going to free him. Arthur is reluctant, given how much of a thorn in his side Micah has been for the last few months, but eventually, Arthur decides to release him.
Arthur uses a nearby steam donkey to rip out the bars of Micah's cell, allowing him to escape. Immediately after escaping, Arthur gives Micah a revolver, and Micah shoots his O'Driscoll cellmate in the head and a shootout erupts, during which Hanley is killed. With a massive group of lawmen in the town, Arthur prompts Micah to escape, but Micah refuses, saying that he has something to do. He makes his way to a house, to find an ex-associate of his named Norman, who took his prized revolvers. As Norman opens the door, he is immediately shot by Micah and then thrown on the ground, before Micah rushes into the house and kills his wife, Maddy, too. With his revolvers back in his possession, Micah then agrees to escape, and both he and Arthur eventually fend off their attackers and narrowly escape the town.[1]
After they are clear, Micah gives Arthur a second holster as thanks, but Arthur berates Micah for his recklessness in going back for his guns and for killing nearly a whole town. Micah apologises somewhat, and says that he and Arthur are ""sons of Dutch"", which makes them almost brothers, who sometimes make mistakes. He then says that he doesn’t want to return to Dutch empty-handed and wishes to do something to redeem himself, asking Arthur to meet him nearby in Big Valley in the near future."

Arthur follows Micah on horseback until they make it to their destination - a ridge, overlooking where the coach should come through. On the way, the two share a mostly belligerent conversation in which they discuss the security of the coach, and the O'Driscolls. They also argue about Micah's reckless habit of causing endless trouble.
After they reach the destination, the pair ambush the coach and take out all of the guards and the driver, before hijacking it and driving it away. Micah takes the reins, and gives Arthur a Lancaster Repeater to use, saying ""that's more your style than mine"". Things seem to be going well, but once the duo get close to the Dakota River, a horde of O'Driscolls attack them and try to commandeer it for themselves, cutting down a tree to block the road. In the chaos, the carriage is blown up by a stick of dynamite, and the two are thrown into the river. Arthur and Micah manage to successfully eliminate their rival outlaws in the ensuing gunfight, with the few remaining O'Driscolls fleeing.
After the robbers are taken out, Arthur meets with Micah at the overturned bank coach. At Micah's request, Arthur shoots the lock and opens the lockbox, which contains a hefty take. The two split the loot between them and then ride their separate ways back to camp."

Arthur decides to take her into Rhodes to buy more supplies for Pearson. Before they leave, Pearson gives Arthur a letter to post for him.
On their way, Sadie cheekily reads Pearson's letter (which is for his aunt Cathy) while mockingly imitating him, which amuses Arthur. Upon arriving, Sadie wants to rob the store, but Arthur tells her they are not meant to cause any trouble. Sadie enters the store while Arthur goes to the post office to mail Pearson's letter. When returning to the wagon, Sadie is seen with new attire and bickering at the store clerk, who is loading boxes into the back of the wagon.
As they are heading back to the camp, Sadie expresses her sadness of how both her home and possessions were destroyed and how she used to enjoy playing the harmonica. Arthur apologizes and offers to find a new harmonica for her. Sadie just tells him to treat her like everyone else and firmly declares that no one will ever ruin her life again. Suddenly, two members of the Lemoyne Raiders approach them and order them to stop. Sadie refuses, shoots one of them and runs down another with the wagon, resulting in more members attacking.
After Arthur and Sadie fight them off, they drive the wagon back into camp, and Arthur decides to not tell Dutch about their encounter.

After a bit of small talk, Arthur gives him some money in exchange for information on a stagecoach which is due to come through Siltwater Strand. Before the pair leave, Alden tells them that there is another clerk in Strawberry who is a member of the “discouraged men” association (as Trelawny calls it).
On their way to Siltwater Strand, Arthur makes known his apprehension on returning to Strawberry, considering the damage he caused there when he rescued Micah. Trelawny assures him that there should not be anyone left who would remember him, considering that nearly the whole town was massacred. He also comments on how popular the gang is becoming with all the trouble they have been causing, and believes they will all be dead soon enough. Arthur replies that he hopes they will all be free before that happens.
Once they reach the interception point, Trelawny decides to not rob the coach violently and tells Arthur to keep his guns holstered. He hands Arthur a lock breaker to open the strongbox in the back of the coach silently while he distracts an opera singer, Chester Damsen, and her driver. They see the coach, and Trelawny rides up to it and convinces Damsen to sing to him while Arthur rides further behind to avoid being seen.

Whilst at camp, Abigail informs Arthur that Hosea and John are waiting at the stolen moonshine stash for him, to attempt to sell it back to the Braithwaites, and that Hosea wants Arthur to join him instead, because John has now been instructed by Dutch to look into something else. Arthur heads over to them.
Part II[]
Arthur meets the pair, and they explain what they plan to do with the moonshine. Hosea explains that since he doesn't have a client to sell the moonshine to, he says that he plans to instead take the stash to the Braithwaites, under the pretense that he was returning lost goods, for a reward. John leaves so he can look into potentially stealing the Braithwaites' prized race horses, for Dutch.
Upon reaching Braithwaite Manor, Hosea explains his intentions to Catherine Braithwaite, the family matriarch, and requests a reward of half of what the stolen moonshine bottles usually cost. Her sons are initially hostile towards Hosea and Arthur, but Catherine orders them to stand down and pay the two. However, Catherine reveals she already knows that Sheriff Leigh Gray was the one who had them take the moonshine, and tells them to hand out the moonshine for free in the local saloon owned by the Grays, for an extra $10. Hosea and Arthur comply and head for Rhodes.
On the way, Hosea decides that he and Arthur assume the roles of two brothers named Melvin and Fenton, as part of their classic clown-and-idiot act, in order to give the moonshine away at the saloon, much to the latter's chagrin. Upon arriving at the saloon, Arthur and Hosea introduce themselves and announce that they will be serving all-you-can-drink moonshine to patrons, for no cost at all, much to their joy.
Hosea and Arthur serve out the moonshine into all into the night, with the drunken chaos and disorder growing by the hour. However, later on, the Lemoyne Raiders enter the saloon and they confront the duo, who are very angry to see what has been happening with the moonshine they were going to buy. A shootout ensues in the saloon, and Hosea and Arthur fight their way out before using the wagon to escape Rhodes while killing more pursuing Raiders. Once the coast is clear, they discuss the nature of the Raiders, and whether the Braithwaites set them up. Hosea heads back to Braithwaite manor, while Arthur returns to camp to speak with Dutch.
Once there, Arthur talks with Dutch and Micah about the two feuding families, and their plan to use the feud as a means to supposedly rob them of large amounts of money and gold. Arthur is initially unsure of whether the plan is a good idea, given the massive amount of trouble they are already in with the law. He also doesn't believe in vengeance, which is one of Dutch's motives behind this plan, as Dutch has a deep hatred for southerners which stems from the death of his father during the Civil War.
Nonetheless, Arthur goes along with Dutch's plan: Dutch tries to play the Grays, whilst Hosea tries to play the Braithwaites. As for Arthur's next move, he can either choose to meet up with Hosea and Sean at Braithwaite Manor, to look into the Grays' tobacco fields, or meet up with John and Javier at Caliga Hall, to look into the Braithwaites' prized race horses."

Arthur and Charles follow Trelawny's trail to the woods, where they find two men - with Trelawny's walking cane next to them. They each subdue a man and interrogate one of them, who informs them that Trelawny is being held at a nearby farm near Braithwaite Manor.
The pair ride there and find Trelawny and the bounty hunters (working under Cole Stoudemire) who kidnapped him near the Braithwaite family's corn fields, but the hunters scatter into the fields upon being discovered, forcing Arthur and Charles to search for them in a game of cat and mouse.

The pair investigate his caravan in Rhodes and find signs of violence, before deducing that he must have been taken by bounty hunters.
Arthur and Charles follow Trelawny's trail to the woods, where they find two men - with Trelawny's walking cane next to them. They each subdue a man and interrogate one of them, who informs them that Trelawny is being held at a nearby farm near Braithwaite Manor.
The pair ride there and find Trelawny and the bounty hunters (working under Cole Stoudemire) who kidnapped him near the Braithwaite family's corn fields, but the hunters scatter into the fields upon being discovered, forcing Arthur and Charles to search for them in a game of cat and mouse.
After dealing with all three bounty hunters - one of whom takes Arthur hostage and is killed by Charles - the duo take care of two more hiding in the barn before return to Trelawny, who claims that he told his kidnappers nothing. He then decides to stay with the gang at their camp, until it's safe to live on his own again. The mission ends with Charles and Trelawny leaving Arthur and riding back to camp."

Once Arthur and Trelawny reach town, they enter the post office, where Trelawny will start a conversation with the teller, Alden Carruthers. After a bit of small talk, Arthur gives him some money in exchange for information on a stagecoach which is due to come through Siltwater Strand. Before the pair leave, Alden tells them that there is another clerk in Strawberry who is a member of the “discouraged men” association (as Trelawny calls it).
On their way to Siltwater Strand, Arthur makes known his apprehension on returning to Strawberry, considering the damage he caused there when he rescued Micah. Trelawny assures him that there should not be anyone left who would remember him, considering that nearly the whole town was massacred. He also comments on how popular the gang is becoming with all the trouble they have been causing, and believes they will all be dead soon enough. Arthur replies that he hopes they will all be free before that happens.
Once they reach the interception point, Trelawny decides to not rob the coach violently and tells Arthur to keep his guns holstered. He hands Arthur a lock breaker to open the strongbox in the back of the coach silently while he distracts an opera singer, Chester Damsen, and her driver. They see the coach, and Trelawny rides up to it and convinces Damsen to sing to him while Arthur rides further behind to avoid being seen. While Damsen sings to Trelawny, Arthur silently opens the lockbox, seizes the money, and sneaks away.
Trelawny joins him soon afterwards after the coach leaves, and the two share the take between them."

They and the other gang members kill the rest of the attacking O'Driscolls, while the few survivors run away.
Dutch then asks Charles, Swanson, and Pearson to bury Kieran while Arthur and John clear out the corpses, but not before being told by Arthur how hateful Colm is. Arthur writes in his journal in a cutscene, where he regrets not being able to save Kieran's life. Kieran's death has a lasting impact on the gang, notably Arthur for failing to save him, Bill because he had grown fond of him, and Mary-Beth who had implicitly fallen in love with him."

Dutch explains that once they get enough money, he plans to have the gang go to either Australia or Tahiti for a better future. He says that he met with the captain of a ship who will take them to one these places if they pay him. Arthur seems doubtful about this, wondering where they will get enough money for a whole boat and a new home, prompting Dutch to point out the trolley station. He reminds Arthur that they don't have much time before the Pinkertons find them and that they need a lot of money, which the station should have.
Arthur, Dutch and Lenny put on their bandanas and enter the station, announcing the robbery. On Dutch's order, Arthur robs three people before forcing the clerk to unlock the safe. But instead of a large take, Arthur only finds a few dollars, just as Lenny sees a large number of armed police outside. Realizing they'd been set up by Bronte, Dutch quickly makes an escape plan, and the trio rush outside and jump aboard a passing trolley as it's moving. They gun down a multitude of police as they ride through the streets before Dutch tells Arthur to slow down the trolley. Arthur attempts to decrease its speed, but the brakes malfunction and the trolley goes off the rails, crashing on its side in the street.
Shaken, the three fight off more police and make their way through the streets until they come across a wagon. With Lenny driving, Dutch and Arthur kill all of the pursuing lawmen until they eventually escape Saint Denis.
The money is split, with Arthur remarking that the three of them each got $15 and a quarter. Dutch is outraged that Bronte set them up, especially since he did nothing wrong to him. He decides that the Saint Denis Bank is now their only hope of paying for their freedom. Lenny then leaves to take Dutch back to camp."

Arthur and Dutch eventually leave and travel to Lagras to meet Thomas, a fisherman who will take them behind Bronte's mansion.
On their way to Lagras, Arthur asks Dutch if going after Bronte is for the bank robbery or revenge for the failed trolley station robbery. Dutch replies that that is not important and that it is necessary if the whole gang is going to have a better life. Their discussion soon moves to a frustrated Dutch asking Arthur for more faith and saying that everyone does not seem to trust him anymore, with Micah being the only loyal one. Arthur manages to calm Dutch down by pointing out that he is also still loyal, as he is riding with him right now, and has followed him for twenty years.
After arriving, the duo help Thomas check crawfish traps, then they look for Jules, a young fisherman who has the boat they need. Arthur finds him hiding in a tree, trying to escape from a ""monster"". As he climbs down, Arthur gets the skiff free from a large tree limb, and the four men start going back to shore. However, they get stuck, and Jules gets out to free the boat. After doing this, he is attacked by the monster, a Bullgator, and Arthur enters the water to get Jules back. He eventually does, and runs to the boat with the Bullgator chasing him. After reaching the boat, Arthur and Dutch shoot at the Bullgator to try and deter it, and start rowing back to shore. Arthur wraps up Jules' damaged leg and stops the bleeding, and Jules passes out.
They eventually reach the village, and two men help the injured Jules away. Dutch leaves to collect some of the gang members and tells Arthur to meet them back at the village later."

They move stealthily until they get close, where either John or Arthur will initiate the fighting by attacking two gangsters that stand in the way of their approach. Gangsters fill the area in front of his mansion, and open fire upon the gang in an attempt to protect Bronte. Nevertheless, the gang kills off the gangsters and storms the building. They quickly clear off the bottom floor, before searching for him, and finding him upstairs. John will knock him out. It is worth the slight time delay to loot his body, as it yields a large cash reward, which should cover the bounty placed on your head following the assault. As they haul him towards the boat, lawmen assault the gang in an attempt to bring them to jail, dead or alive, for kidnapping. The gang breaks past the innumerable police officers, and gets to the boat.
On the way back, Dutch and Bronte get into a heated argument. Bronte then insults Dutch's outlaw lifestyle and attempts to offer a huge sum of money to any of his gang members in exchange for them betraying and killing Dutch, to no avail.

https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Welcome_to_the_New_World,Chapter_5:_Guarma,"Having survived the shipwreck, and washed ashore on Guarma, Arthur begins searching for the gang.","On the shore of a sandy beach on a tropical island, Arthur wakes up, distraught and alone with no food or water. He has no idea where he is and begins walking along the beach. Soon, his face becomes sunburned from the heat and he collapses several times, but keeps going until he sees a wisp of smoke in the distance.
Following the smoke, Arthur sees Dutch, Micah, Bill, and Javier huddled around a campfire, who are very relieved to see him. After giving Arthur some water, Dutch explains that they are on Guarma, a sugar plantation island east of Cuba. As the group wonder what to do, they are ambushed by a local militia led by Levi Simon, who runs the sugar plantation for Alberto Fussar. After putting the men in chains, Simon escorts them up the beach and explains the ""labor troubles"" he and Fussar are having with the locals and promises to free the gang once he knows more about them, before telling his troops (in Spanish) to take the group back to their base and imprison them.
After Simon rides off, Dutch tells Arthur that they must not let the militia find out about them. Eventually, some local guerrilla rebels are found and added to the gang's chain. Suddenly, the militia's leader is ambushed, and Arthur is able to steal one of their guns and kill the guards while the others free themselves. As more soldiers arrive, the leader of the ambush, Hercule Fontaine, urges the gang to come with him fast. The other men escape, but Javier is shot in the leg and captured by the soldiers. Unable to help him, the gang run with Hercule through the jungle to an old building, where they take up arms and fight off the soldiers.
Afterwards, Hercule leads the gang through the jungle. He and Leon Fuentes, another rebel leader, explain about Colonel Fussar and how he rules over Guarma and enslaves the inhabitants through the sugar farming. Hercule also points out the sugar factory Aguasdulces, and Cinco Torres, a hideout used by him and the rebels. He promises to help the gang leave the island if they help him with something first; freeing a group of slaves captured by Fussar's men while trying to escape. Although Dutch is doubtful, Hercule reassures that he’s his only option. After arriving at La Capilla, the rebels' camp, Dutch promises that they will try to help. Grateful, Hercule and Leon leave and the exhausted gang members try to get some sleep, but not before Dutch plans to scope out a way to the sugar factory to rescue Javier."

Dutch hands Arthur a flaming torch and they slowly make their way across the cliff. Arthur asks where they are going to go after leaving Guarma and Dutch says that they will head back to Saint Denis in the US, as that is the least place anyone will expect them to go. Arthur is baffled and skeptical at this idea despite Dutch's reassurances. The duo arrive at the entrance to a cave, where they are greeted by an old woman named Gloria, who Dutch pays in gold to guide them through the cave.
As they head through the cave, Arthur asks what else happened during the bank robbery that he never saw, and Dutch wonders with suspicion why Hosea and Lenny were both killed but John was spared and imprisoned and how Abigail managed to escape. Upon reaching a ladder, Gloria demands more money, but Dutch had already paid her with the last gold bar he had. She pulls a knife on him, but she is uncharacteristically choked to death by Dutch, much to Arthur's shock and dismay.
As they climb up the ladder, Arthur questions Dutch's murderous actions and Dutch replies that he will do whatever it takes to ensure that the gang survive. Outside Aguasdulces, they see Javier being dragged by a donkey and mocked by Colonel Fussar and his soldiers. After killing two guards, the pair sneak into the refinery and sabotage the compound sugar production, ripping open bags of sugar and setting the place on fire with the furnace to create a distraction. After the building explodes, they free Javier and fight their way out of the compound. With Dutch carrying an unconscious Javier, they run through the sugar fields while Arthur holds off the men chasing them.
They cross a small stream, and Dutch tells Arthur to hold off the men, then meet him at the fortress in Cinco Torres. Arthur kills the last of the men and departs."

Arthur wakes up tied to a chair and his captor, a tall man called Angel, pulls a bag off his head. Angel punches Arthur to wake him up. He asks Arthur for his name and what he is doing on Guarma and continues to beat him. Arthur gives Angel an alias, which seems to satisfy him. Arthur then sees Leon and another man, Baptiste, tied up. Angel interrogates the former about Arthur and Leon lies that he does not know him. Angel punches Leon in the face, then heads over to Baptiste and kicks him. While his captor's back is turned, Arthur attempts to escape from his chair and manages to free himself. Angel is surprised and pulls out his knife, but Arthur quickly tackles him to the ground and knocks him out.
Arthur takes Angel's knife and frees the others. Baptiste tells Arthur that he believes that there is still time to save the workers and hands Arthur a rifle. Leon states that he heard some voices down in the ruins and asks Arthur to come with him to check it out. Baptiste is seen struggling to get up and Leon tells him to rest due to his beatings from Angel.
Arthur follows Leon through the ruins and they sneak past some Cuban soldiers patrolling the area. They eventually reach the workers, who the soldiers are preparing to hang, and Leon tells Arthur to shoot the ropes to free them. Arthur does so, but the soldiers hear the gunshots.

Immediately after this, Hercule and the gang are told to get on the roof quickly, where they spot a large warship approaching just offshore.
The group get in cover and fire at the mass of soldiers who are running up the beach while Hercule prepares a cannon so they can fire on the warship. Arthur helps Hercule push the cannon into position, but the fortress is breached soon after. While Micah and Bill remain on the roof to guard the cannon, Arthur, Hercule, and Dutch head down to fend off the approaching soldiers while evading the warship's blasts. As more men begin to row in on boats from both sides, Arthur assigns Dutch and Hercule different positions to defend. Once the remaining soldiers have been eliminated, Dutch stays behind to hold off the reinforcements while Arthur and Hercule return to the roof and use the cannon to destroy the warship.

Upon arriving at Shady Belle, Arthur finds a letter in one of the rooms on the first floor written by ""Caroline"" (Sadie Adler), that instructs Arthur to travel to Lakay, a small swamp town north of Saint Denis.

Sometime later, Micah and Javier arrive off screen, followed by Dutch, shocking the rest of the gang, with Strauss telling him that it is mostly due to Sadie that the rest of the gang managed to survive the ordeal. Abigail also tells Dutch that they stole the bodies of Hosea and Lenny from the morgue and buried them. Finally, Bill enters with evident frustration, saying how he asked everywhere where to find the gang.
Almost immediately afterwards, the reunion is cut short as the Pinkertons descend upon the camp, with Agent Milton telling the gang to surrender, and then deciding to fire a machine gun at the gang. To combat this, Sadie tells Arthur to follow her, saying that there is a trapdoor somewhere that they can use to flank the Pinkertons. The pair do so, and begin a counterattack on the Pinkertons, who set fire to the village. During the fighting, Bill helps Arthur and Sadie fend off the attack, while Arthur eventually mans the machine gun, swirling it around and gunning down the Pinkerton attackers, eventually causing them to retreat.
Afterwards, Dutch thanks Arthur for his help in fending off the attack and expresses concern over Arthur's coughing, while the latter dismisses it as nothing. Abigail reminds Dutch that John is in prison, only to get a flustered response from Dutch, who says that it isn't the right time.

They arrive on the outskirts of the city, where the balloon owner, Arturo Bullard is happy to meet Arthur, but says that Sadie can't go with them, citing that flying messes with a woman's ""vapors"".
Arthur gets into the balloon and is put in charge of controlling it while having a talk with Bullard. Eventually, they reach the penitentiary, and in one of the fields, Arthur spots a prisoner who he thinks is almost certainly John. Immediately afterwards, the guards begin shooting at the balloon, but Arthur and Bullard fly away out of the guards' reach.
As they near Annesburg, Bullard sees Sadie on horseback, getting chased by a gang of O'Driscolls. Arthur gives Bullard control over the balloon while he begins shooting at the O'Driscolls, in an attempt to save Sadie. During the skirmish, Bullard gets hit, before being hit again a few seconds later, causing him to die and fall out of the basket. Taking control, Arthur has to avoid a bridge that is in the way; he rises above the bridge before throwing a rope down to Sadie, in order to pull her up into the balloon. Arthur tries to make the balloon rise, but it runs out of fuel and crashes on the bank of a river. Both Arthur and Sadie emerge fairly unscathed from the crash, but they are assaulted by a large group of O'Driscolls from across the river. After this, more O'Driscolls emerge from the woods, but they are also gunned down by Arthur and Sadie.
After the O'Driscolls have been eliminated, Arthur reprimands Sadie for Bullard's death and for recklessly and unnecessarily pursuing O'Driscolls when she didn’t need to. In response, Sadie changes the subject and asks Arthur whether he saw John, to which Arthur confirms that he did. Sadie forms a plan on the two of them sneaking into the prison and freeing John, though Arthur seems unsure. Before she leaves, Sadie tells Arthur something else: Colm O'Driscoll has been captured and sentenced to hang. While Arthur is initially dismissive, saying that he had escaped before, Sadie tells him that she intends to make sure that Colm doesn’t escape again."

While fighting their way out of the town, Dutch and Arthur go to find Micah. They see him knocking out Janson before continuing their escape. After eventually escaping the town and riding into the forest on some stolen horses, they finally lose their pursuers. Arthur sarcastically comments on how it wasn’t the ""social call"" that Dutch promised, while Micah shows Dutch and Arthur the papers that he stole. They reveal that the Cornwall Company struck a deal with the Army, and that they are transporting dynamite from Annesburg to Saint Denis. Dutch tells Micah and Arthur to look into the dynamite, along with Bill."

They are quickly interrupted by Dutch, who calls Arthur over to him. Dutch tells him that the gang will go north to New York before heading to the tropics. He explains his ideas regarding ""smoke and commotion"" and making the gang money, while Arthur instead says that the gang are ""not so good at doing scores anymore"" and is doubtful of Dutch's plans.
Suddenly, they are interrupted with the arrival of Eagle Flies, who is escorted into camp by Karen and Javier. Eagle Flies explains that the US Army have confiscated his tribe's horses, and that his people will ""starve"" if he doesn’t retrieve them, before going on to denounce the abduction of said horses as an ""act of war"". Charles tells him that, as he promised Rains Fall, he will not get involved in this conflict. Meanwhile, Dutch spontaneously decides to help him, and tells Eagle Flies to put his money away. Suspicious of Dutch's motives, Charles and Arthur decide to accompany the pair.
The group ride southeast, near to Copperhead Landing. On the way, Arthur questions Dutch on why he is helping Eagle Flies with this, despite seemingly having nothing to gain from it. Dutch, however, brushes this off and reminds him of the gang's motto, before later telling him that interfering in the Native Americans' conflict with the Army may divert attention away from the gang. The group arrive at their destination, and meet up with a few other Wapiti men, including Paytah. Before starting their mission, the group decide to wait until nighttime in order for them to sneak aboard the boat more easily thanks to the darkness.
With the arrival of night, the group silently row towards the ship, which is carrying the horses, and quietly board it. Once on it, they stealthily neutralize the soldiers on-board, including a group playing poker. Once this is done, Dutch begins to drive the ship towards the land. Unfortunately, though, he loses control and accelerates rapidly, before crashing. As a result, the ship begins to take on a large amount of water, and the gang are forced to free the horses and swim with them back to land. After leading most of them back to the riverbank, Eagle Flies asks Arthur to round up the remaining few. Arthur mounts one of these horses and, while leading two others, gets back to land by riding the swimming horse.
Upon arriving at the shore, Dutch offers to ride with Eagle Flies to take the horses back to the reservation while promising him that they will defeat the Army and save the Indians, leaving Arthur more worried than ever. After the two ride away, Charles asks Arthur to go and visit Rains Fall, which the player can either accept or decline."

https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/The_Bridge_to_Nowhere,Chapter_6:_Beaver_Hollow,John and Arthur plant dynamite on the Bacchus Bridge in order to create a distraction and disrupt the army's transportation.,"Arthur meets John at Bacchus Bridge, where they are given the job of attaching dynamite to the bridge and blowing it up. The two begin to talk about how Dutch has gone mad, with John saying that Dutch could have saved him during the bank robbery in Saint Denis but chose not to. In response, Arthur abruptly tells John to take his family and leave the gang. John questions Arthur on loyalty, to which Arthur assures him that it is still the right decision. Before John can get a reply in, Arthur tells him that it is ""over"", and that John should ""run and don’t look back"".
Realising that they had strayed from their original objective in blowing up the bridge, the pair load the dynamite crates on to a handcar and move them onto the bridge. They move it halfway and then stop, where they lower the crates onto the underside of the bridge. Here, they open the boxes and attach the dynamite bundles to the beams of the bridge, which are already wired to a detonator. As Arthur attaches the last bundle to a beam, John announces that a train is coming. Arthur quickly climbs up the ladder and works the handcar with John, with the train right on their tail. The pair narrowly manage to get to the end of the bridge and jump off the handcar and on to the ground, where John tells Arthur that they can use the detonator and finally blow up the bridge. Arthur does so, and the middle section of the bridge collapses and falls into the water below it.
With the bridge blown up, Arthur jokes that it won’t help in diverting attention away from the gang, with John saying that he doesn’t understand Dutch's plan and the logic behind it. Arthur reminds John that he needs to leave the gang and forget about ""loyalty"", saying that it’s done him no good over the years. When John claims that he’ll ""think about"" the idea of leaving the gang, Arthur tells him that he has, himself, done a lot of thinking, and that he’s come to the conclusion that he and John are risking their lives for nothing, and that the days of outlaw gangs are coming to an end, arguing that this isn’t why it’s so vital for John to leave. He also tells John that he’ll need money for it, and suggests using the gang's stash that Dutch has hidden. John tells him that Abigail thinks she knows where the money is, to which Arthur tells him to discuss this with him when she does, and that he’s seeing things more clearly now. John then drives off on the wagon, and the two part ways."

Against his father, Chief Rains Fall's wishes. Dutch and the gang then accompany Eagle Flies into battle against the U.S. Army.","Arthur meets Dutch outside of his tent, where there is a small gathering. He expresses his discontent over Cleet and Joe's presence in the gang and asks what's going on. Micah tells him to show Dutch some respect but, before anything else can happen, Wapiti Indian warriors led by Eagle Flies ride into Beaver Hollow, armed and wearing war paint. Eagle Flies says the Army tried to kill his people for oil, and asks the gang to ride into battle against the Army with him. Rains Fall then arrives at camp and tries to intervene, saying that the men will be annihilated and telling Eagle Flies not to die for pride and that he is ""my last boy"". Eagle Flies ignores his pleas, telling his father that his words ""mean nothing"" to him, before he and his men depart from Beaver Hollow to battle the Army at the oil refinery. Desperate, Rains Fall turns to Arthur and begs for his help, just as Arthur had helped him before. Arthur agrees, followed by Charles, then Dutch and eventually the rest of the gang except for Micah, Cleet and Joe. As the gang ride out to the oil fields, they come across a wounded Indian warrior, who tells them that Eagle Flies is in trouble and that he needs help.
When the gang arrive, Arthur and Charles soon spot Eagle Flies on the walkway, fighting. Arthur, Charles and Sadie ride with a small group of Wapiti Indians to rescue him, while the rest of the gang go with Dutch to attack the Army from a different angle. During the fierce battle, Arthur eventually finds Eagle Flies, who is in a tussle with a soldier. Arthur kills the soldier and saves Eagle Flies, who joins Arthur's group and continues fighting with him. Eventually, they regroup with Dutch and the others and, after taking out the reinforcements who arrive by train and dealing with a machine gun, the gang and the Indians finally manage to wipe out most of the enemy soldiers.
With the battle seemingly won, Dutch and Arthur enter the warehouse to find the state bonds that the former had wanted, while Eagle Flies stays outside to take care of his wounded men. Dutch and Arthur enter the office in the warehouse and, after a brief search, Dutch manages to find the state bonds. With this, Dutch decides to leave before anymore soldiers arrive at the scene. On their way downstairs, they hear Colonel Favours telling his men to search for and kill the pair. Dutch and Arthur quickly eliminate a small group of them, before making their way to the exit. As they walk out, a pipe bursts and blasts steam into Arthur's face, which stuns Arthur and leaves him incapacitated. Despite seeing Arthur being circled by a small group of soldiers, and him calling for help, Dutch simply abandons Arthur and leaves him to die. However, before Arthur is killed, Eagle Flies bursts in and kills the soldiers in quick succession. He begins to help Arthur up but, as he is momentarily distracted, Colonel Favours appears and shoots Eagle Flies in the abdomen, mortally wounding him. Favours then turns towards Arthur and prepares to shoot him too, only to be shot and killed by Arthur first. Afterwards, a dismayed Arthur gets up and helps the fatally injured Eagle Flies out of the warehouse.
Once he and Eagle Flies are outside, Arthur confronts Dutch about intentionally leaving him to die in the warehouse. Dutch vehemently denies this and responds by telling Arthur not to be a ""fool."" Arthur then puts Eagle Flies on the back of his horse to take him back to Rains Fall at the Wapiti Indian Reservation, along with Charles and Paytah. During the journey, Arthur and Charles discuss how Dutch left the former to die, how far the gang has fallen, and how disappointed they are with the conflict between the Indians and the Army. Once they arrive at the reservation, Arthur and Charles bring Eagle Flies into Rains Fall's tent. Rains Fall has one last moment with his son, before Eagle Flies succumbs to his gunshot wound and dies, with Rains Fall weeping the loss of his last son. Outside, Charles tells the Wapiti Indians that they must move away, and opts to stay with them. Arthur offers to stay, too, But Charles says that he has other people to take care of, and the two say goodbye and hug.
As Arthur rides back to camp, he has a severe coughing fit caused by his now-advanced Tuberculosis and collapses into unconsciousness. He is soon rescued by the German family who he had helped earlier that year and taken to Annesburg. Arthur wakes up from a bed and the mother in the family gives him something to drink and tells him that she wishes she could do more to help, but Arthur says that he must go and leaves."
https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Our_Best_Selves,Chapter_6:_Beaver_Hollow,"As their final job, the gang ride to Saint Denis to intercept and rob a train carrying army supplies and payroll, headed for the recently destroyed Bacchus Bridge.","Arthur is greeted by Dutch, who says that Uncle, Pearson and Mary-Beth have run away, calling them cowards. Dutch then tells Arthur that the gang are about to rob a train, and that it will be the gang’s last job, prompting doubt from Arthur. Arthur agrees to take part in the robbery, but has one request - for John and his family to leave the gang. When Arthur ""insists"" on it, Dutch is initially hurt, but quickly calms down and seemingly agrees. He then rallies the gang and they walk to their horses, but it is clear that Dutch is furious at Arthur's decisions.
The gang then ride to Saint Denis to catch the train that they’re going to rob. On the way, John goes to get the dynamite that he had hidden, and Arthur decides to go with him. They talk about the dubious situation, and the plan to get John out of the gang. When Arthur promises that he will do all he can to help John and his family get to safety, John thanks Arthur for always looking out for him. After Arthur retrieves the dynamite, the pair ride back to the others who are waiting on the outskirts of the city.
The gang plan to board the train silently when it‘s stopped, but the train does not stop and instead thunders past them. In response, the gang (mainly Arthur, John, Cleet and Sadie) chase after the train and eventually board it, while they begin fighting the US Army soldiers on board. At some point, a train carriage catches fire thanks to a soldier firing at a lantern while dying. Arthur jumps onto the back of Dutch’s horse (and John onto the back of Bill's) so that they can overtake the burning carriage and continue with the robbery.
On the new carriage, Arthur sets up a Maxim Gun while John works on uncoupling the burning train carriage. Unfortunately for him, he is shot in the shoulder while doing so and falls off the train. Dutch promises that he’ll go back and get John (along with Javier, Micah, and Joe), while Arthur, Sadie and Cleet fight off the soldiers on their tail. Eventually, they are free of them and head to the armored carriage before Arthur plants the dynamite on the carriage’s door to blow it open. He accesses the loot, and is surprised at how much there is, until the gang has to leap off the train as it approaches the destroyed Bacchus Bridge and plunges into the chasm.
After getting out, the others meet up with them and Dutch and Micah tell Arthur that John ""didn’t make it"", and that he had perished. Disappointed, Arthur rides with the others back to camp with the money, at which point the next mission begins."
https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_(mission),Chapter_6:_Beaver_Hollow,"With John assumed dead, and Abigail captured by Pinkertons, Dutch cuts them loose, and rides for Beaver Hollow. Arthur and Sadie head to Van Horn to rescue Abigail.","As the gang are riding away from the train robbery, they run into Tilly Jackson and Jack Marston, the former of whom informs them that Abigail has been captured by Agent Milton and taken to Van Horn to be put on a boat and tried for murder. Due in part to some persuasion from Micah, Dutch decides to disregard her and, along with most of the others, rides back to Beaver Hollow, at which point Arthur, frustrated at Dutch's decision to let Jack possibly become an orphan, accepts that he is done following Dutch. He gives Tilly a sack of the money and tells her to wait with Jack at Copperhead Landing, and he and Sadie set off to rescue Abigail. As they ride, Arthur expresses his disgust at how Dutch and the gang have changed, as well as the deaths of various gang members that have happened recently. Sadie reassures him that the two of them do not need the gang and can save Abigail on their own.
Upon reaching Van Horn, Sadie, noticing Arthur's coughing, asks him to take up a position at the top of the lighthouse with a sniper rifle. Despite initially objecting, Arthur does so and the two take out several Pinkerton agents. Sadie eventually reaches Milton at the town's fence, only to be taken hostage by his men. Arthur, enraged at Milton's, agrees to settle this ""like gentlemen"" and follows, fighting his way through more Pinkertons, and eventually reaches the building. He guns down the agents holding the two hostage and begins to release Abigail, but is held at gunpoint by Milton, who reveals that Micah has been working as a mole for the Pinkertons ever since the gang returned from Guarma, instead of Molly as the gang had thought. Arthur tries to wrestle Milton’s revolver off him, but struggles due to his Tuberculosis, resulting in Milton pointing the gun at Arthur and preparing to execute him. Meanwhile, Abigail manages to break free, picks up Sadie's revolver, and shoots Milton in the temple with it, killing him and saving Arthur's life. With Milton's death, the three escape Van Horn, fending off more pursuing agents as they do so.
At some point during the ride, Arthur stops and tells the two women that he wants to go back to confront the others, while sending a reluctant Abigail and Sadie to Copperhead Landing to reunite with Jack. Before she and Sadie depart, Abigail gives Arthur the key to Dutch's chest in Beaver Hollow with all of their money. On the way to Beaver Hollow, the song ""That's the Way It Is"" plays, with various quotes throughout the game being remembered by Arthur.
Arthur arrives at Beaver Hollow as Micah orders Susan Grimshaw and the remaining gang members to pack up quicker. He informs them that Abigail is safe and that Micah is the traitor. Micah strongly denies this, while Dutch remains silent. As the tension continues to rise, John arrives, much to everyone's surprise, revealing that Dutch left him to die during the robbery, although Dutch tries to claim that he did not have a choice. Arthur tells the gang's members to choose their side; Micah tells him to be quiet, but Susan sides with Arthur and John, and points a shotgun at Micah, demanding that he put his guns down. Immediately afterwards, Javier announces that Pinkertons are closing in; this momentarily distracts Susan, who is then shot by Micah. Dutch then takes out his own pair of revolvers, completely ignoring Susan's death screams, demanding to know who is ""with"" him and who is ""betraying"" him. Eventually, most of the gang unites behind Dutch and Micah against Arthur and John, holding the pair at gunpoint. Before any shooting can happen, a group of Pinkertons led by Agent Ross attack the camp, causing the gang to scatter in different directions.
Dutch and the others manage to leave Beaver Hollow by road as Arthur and John escape through the caves, with Pinkertons in hot pursuit. Arthur reveals to John that his family are safe at Copperhead Landing and that Micah betrayed the gang. The duo mount their horses after exiting the caves and flee, while Dutch and the others pursue and shoot at them. Eventually, their horses are fatally shot from under them, and Arthur takes a moment to thank his horse as it passes away. After some climbing, Arthur tells John that he might return to the camp to retrieve the money, as Abigail gave him the key to Dutch’s chest. John says that he would rather go back to his family, and so the player is left with two options:
Help John to escape: John and Arthur continue going over the mountains, until Arthur tells John that he can’t go any further (due to his increasingly advanced Tuberculosis). He gives John his hat and satchel, expressing that it would mean a lot to him if John got away safely. John is reluctant to leave Arthur’s side, but eventually does so after persuasion from him, calling him his ""brother"". After holding off some Pinkertons, Arthur is tackled to the ground by Micah and the two engage in a lengthy brawl. By the end, both men are badly beaten, and Arthur pistol-whips Micah with his revolver but loses his grip on it in the process. Arthur crawls towards it in order to shoot Micah, but is prevented from doing so by Dutch, who steps on Arthur's hand and tells him that it is over. A weakened Arthur states again that Micah was the rat, that he gave all he had for Dutch and the gang and that John was the only one who ""made it"". Dutch, presumably finally realising the truth, says nothing and walks away from the scene, leaving both Arthur and a frustrated Micah behind. The subsequent scene depends on the player's Honor.
High Honor: After Dutch's departure, Micah angrily walks away, leaving Arthur to die. Arthur then crawls to the edge of the cliff and watches one last sunrise before succumbing to his illness, his injuries, and exhaustion.
Low Honor: Micah approaches Arthur while aiming a revolver at his head, vengefully claiming that he is not any better. Micah then shoots Arthur in the forehead, killing him instantly, before sadistically laughing, spitting on his corpse, and leaving.
Go back for the money: Arthur bids John farewell and gives him all of his possessions, before heading back to Beaver Hollow. After fighting his way past Pinkertons, he enters the cave at the site and finds a huge sack of money from Dutch’s chest. However, as he exits the caves, he is suddenly attacked by Micah and stabbed in the side with his own knife. After wrestling Micah off of him and taking back his knife, Micah takes out his own blade and the two engage in a knife fight. This can end in two ways, depending on the player's Honor.
High Honor: Eventually, Arthur manages to slash Micah’s left eye, blinding it and leaving a terrible scar. Enraged, Micah tackles Arthur to the ground and tries to stab him, but Arthur bites his hand and punches him, forcing Micah off. Dutch then arrives and breaks up the fight, but after Arthur re-iterates that Micah is the traitor, Dutch leaves both of them behind. Micah also leaves, and is seen taking the money sack which Arthur took from the caves. Arthur is left to die, and watches his final sunrise before succumbing to his illness, the injuries he had sustained, and exhaustion.
Low Honor: Arthur loses his balance during the fight, and after a hostile exchange of words, Micah tackles Arthur to the ground and stabs him in the chest. Micah proceeds to sink the knife deeper into Arthur, but Dutch arrives and stops him from doing so. Arthur pleads Dutch to kill Micah, reminding him that he is the true traitor, but Dutch merely abandons the two men. With Arthur and Micah left together, Arthur begins to crawl away, but Micah approaches him with a knife in hand and finishes Arthur off by stabbing him in the back.

After leading most of them back to the riverbank, Eagle Flies asks Arthur to round up the remaining few. Arthur mounts one of these horses and, while leading two others, gets back to land by riding the swimming horse.
Upon arriving at the shore, Dutch offers to ride with Eagle Flies to take the horses back to the reservation while promising him that they will defeat the Army and save the Indians, leaving Arthur more worried than ever.

Once there, he is invited into Rains Fall's tent. Soon afterwards, Arthur begins coughing, which Rains Fall quickly picks up on, and asks Arthur if he is sufficiently well. Rains Fall laments the fact that Arthur went on a raid with Eagle Flies, calling the latter ""the impetuous prince"". Arthur apologizes Afterwards, Rains Fall asks Arthur to accompany him to a site that is sacred to the tribe, which Arthur accepts.
The pair mount their horses and set out for their destination. Soon after departing the reservation, Captain Monroe intercepts them and informs Rains Fall that the meeting he went to in order to help secure the tribe's homeland went badly. Rains Fall thanks him for his help nonetheless, and Monroe asks Arthur if he could help with something at some point soon; the player can either agree to help him or refuse. After Captain Monroe leaves, Arthur and Rains Fall continue riding. On the way, they can talk about various things - Arthur can discuss Eagle Flies, or Dutch van der Linde, who Rains Fall is keen to know about. Additionally, the conversation can move on to Arthur discussing his sickness and how he is terminally ill, or even his own son, who died some time ago. Along the way, Rains Fall collects a number of herbs, which are supposed to make Arthur's cough less severe.
The two eventually arrive at the site, where Rains Fall is horrified to discover that it has been destroyed in an arson attack and the Chanupa, a very sacred artefact for the Wapiti Indians, has been stolen. They begin looking for clues as to who had committed the act and find a number of discarded whiskey bottles on the ground. Rains Fall then says that it was likely to have been US Army soldiers and proceeds to survey the area around him with Arthur, using binoculars. Arthur spots an Army camp at the bottom of the valley and decides they must have been responsible for the attack and the theft of the Chanupa. Arthur offers to infiltrate the camp and steal it back from the soldiers. Rains Fall is initially hesitant but allows Arthur to do so. However, he tells him not to harm any of the soldiers.
Arthur then makes his way into the camp to steal back the Chanupa.  The soldiers will react to sound in the area and move to investigate, but will only become hostile if they clearly observe Arthur. Undetected or otherwise, Arthur finds the pieces of the Chanupa on the ground near the central campfire and gathers them before returning it to Rains Fall. When he does, Rains Fall asks if anyone was hurt; if so, he bemoans that the Army will surely seek revenge for the attack. If it was done without killing any guards, Rains Fall thanks Arthur for his restraint and gives him a sacred Owl Feather Trinket as a gift."

Arthur is initially hesitant and says that he doesn’t have the energy for it anymore (due to his illness) and that he no longer cares about the O'Driscolls, especially after Colm's execution. In response, Sadie reminds him that they killed her husband and that Arthur is ""the only one of these fools that I trust"". At this point the player can either accept or decline the mission:

He tries to convince Sadie that she is better than this, but Sadie pointedly tells him ""that ain’t true"" and rides away by herself. Declining the mission will lower the player's Honor and the player will not be able to do Part II.
If the player accepts, Arthur reluctantly says that he will go with her, but asks her to do something for him in return - to help John, Abigail and Jack to leave the gang ""when the time comes."" Sadie accepts Arthur's deal and promises Arthur that she will help them. She then asks Arthur if he would like to ride with her to Hanging Dog Ranch now, or to meet her there at a later date. Choosing to ride with her will start Part II immediately.

Dutch tells him that they plan to use dynamite to take several trees down to trap a platoon of soldiers heading through the valley in order to humiliate them by tarring and feathering them.
Despite his objections, Arthur helps Dutch set up the dynamite, during which Dutch reveals his real intentions to Arthur; he plans to use the Natives to draw government attention away from the gang and onto the Natives, or in his own words ""draw attention to one problem and a veil over the other"". Arthur says that the Indians are good people whom Dutch is seemingly using for his own gain which Dutch denies. They head back up to the others and wait for the patrol to arrive. When it does, they blow down the trees before Dutch draws his gun and tells the trapped soldiers to just surrender, accept the humiliation and leave, but more soldiers appear and open fire, forcing Dutch, Arthur and the Indians to fight.
After killing the soldiers, they head down and search the bodies. Suddenly a cannon shot interrupts them as more soldiers attack. During the fight, Arthur deals with the cannon, and afterwards Eagle Flies goes to help a wounded Paytah. Arthur and Dutch have a brief argument on everything they are doing, but soon hear the sound of reinforcements coming from Fort Wallace and run to their horses, leaving Eagle Flies behind.
They try to escape through the rocky mountain pass while fending off their pursuers, but eventually run into a dead end and a broken bridge on a cliff, leaving them cornered. As the soldiers close in, Dutch delivers a speech to them about how ""my whole life, all I ever did was fight"" whilst he and Arthur back away towards the cliff edge, their hands raised. They then leap right off and into the river far below whilst being shot at by the soldiers, and swim to safety on the riverbank.
Dutch expresses his relief on their lucky escape and assumes that Eagle Flies was captured, if not killed. He decides to tell Charles back at camp to plan a rescue mission and leaves Arthur to rest, telling him to ""have faith""."

Arthur enters Rains Fall's tent, and the chief expresses his concern over Eagle Flies being captured, stating that he thinks his son is foolish but that he loves him regardless. After hearing this, Arthur, despite Rains Fall's initial protests, decides to rescue Eagle Flies. He finds Charles and the two set out for Fort Wallace.
During the journey there, Charles tells Arthur about his plan for infiltrating and escaping the fort, and also voices his dismay at Dutch's exploitation of the Wapiti Indians' situation. The conversation ultimately leads to Arthur informing Charles that he is terminally ill and will not live for much longer, after which Charles says that he is, in a way, lucky to know this as it gives him time to make amends. Charles suggests that Arthur may be with him for that purpose. The duo then arrive at the fort and wait until it is dark so that they are less likely to be noticed.
Charles and Arthur then sneak around the fort, staying close to the wall. In order to avoid detection, they use arrows and knives to silently kill the nearby guards, before arriving at the back. Here, Charles uses a grappling hook for him and Arthur to scale the wall and arrive inside. The pair continue to sneak around the outskirts of the fort, searching for Eagle Flies' location. They eventually come to a tower, where Charles suggests silently shooting a lantern in the distance to cause a fire, distracting the guards so they can enter prison area. Arthur does so, allowing them to enter the building unseen. After Charles kills the prison guard, Arthur steals the keys, unlocks the prison door, and cuts Eagle Flies free.
Immediately after, an alarm sounds, and the soldiers outside begin to open fire. After he and Charles dispatch them, Arthur looks for a way to escape the fort.

He expresses his discontent over Cleet and Joe's presence in the gang and asks what's going on. Micah tells him to show Dutch some respect but, before anything else can happen, Wapiti Indian warriors led by Eagle Flies ride into Beaver Hollow, armed and wearing war paint. Eagle Flies says the Army tried to kill his people for oil, and asks the gang to ride into battle against the Army with him. Rains Fall then arrives at camp and tries to intervene, saying that the men will be annihilated and telling Eagle Flies not to die for pride and that he is ""my last boy"". Eagle Flies ignores his pleas, telling his father that his words ""mean nothing"" to him, before he and his men depart from Beaver Hollow to battle the Army at the oil refinery. Desperate, Rains Fall turns to Arthur and begs for his help, just as Arthur had helped him before. Arthur agrees, followed by Charles, then Dutch and eventually the rest of the gang except for Micah, Cleet and Joe.

He begins to help Arthur up but, as he is momentarily distracted, Colonel Favours appears and shoots Eagle Flies in the abdomen, mortally wounding him. Favours then turns towards Arthur and prepares to shoot him too, only to be shot and killed by Arthur first. Afterwards, a dismayed Arthur gets up and helps the fatally injured Eagle Flies out of the warehouse.
Once he and Eagle Flies are outside, Arthur confronts Dutch about intentionally leaving him to die in the warehouse. Dutch vehemently denies this and responds by telling Arthur not to be a ""fool."" Arthur then puts Eagle Flies on the back of his horse to take him back to Rains Fall at the Wapiti Indian Reservation, along with Charles and Paytah.

He also explains that Favours himself had a very poor career in the American Civil War, and that he is an insecure man who wants one final victory before retirement. Additionally, he also says that there is a culture of scorn and disdain for the Indians in Favours' regiment, which only makes things worse.

Arthur apologizes to Archie for the position he has put them in.

Arthur apologizes to Edith, for what he did to her family, understanding that his actions were horrible, and that he's suffering grave consequences for them. However, he also tells her to not get herself and Archie killed because of her pride (referring to her refusing to accept Arthur's money and leave Annesburg with her son). She begins crying, feeling ashamed of how her life changed since she and Archie lost their home. Arthur can convince her to return to Archie in either a gently or harshly-spoken manner, but she complies either way.
On the ride back, Arthur continues to apologize, but Edith doesn't want to hear it, as it won't bring her husband back. She tells him to stop feeling guilt or seeking penance for his actions, and instead decide what kind of man he wants to be, before his TB infection kills him. She also makes it very clear that she still hates Arthur's guts, with him understanding this and not expecting it to change.

They proceed on their journey, and Charles explains to John the violent, murderous nature of the Skinners and how they prefer to move around rather than settle in one place.
The wagons soon arrive at Beecher's Hope, where Uncle awaits (asleep as usual). John and Charles tell him about the unfortunate incident involving the Skinner Brothers on the way. As John and Uncle gather up the wooden planks and boards, Charles decides to take Wayne's body home for burial and Uncle adds that the three of them will be fine together."

Uncle uses his 'terminal lumbago' as an excuse to get out of doing the actual work and instead contents himself with giving the orders.
John and Charles assemble the house over the course of several weeks - first placing the joists to build the foundation, then hammering in the joists, raising the house frame and finally placing the tiles for the rooftop. Once the house is finished, the trio raise a toast to John's new home.
Later, John writes a letter to Abigail informing her of his reunion with Charles and Uncle, their help in the acquisition and construction of his newly-purchased land and house, and tries to convince her that he has changed his former ways, and misses her and Jack dearly."

John yells at Uncle for being lazy and Uncle asks John if he believes in reincarnation and John states that he does not believe in that. Uncle complains about his condition, but John tells him to help out with farming. Uncle tells John that the land is good for grazing and suggests that John will need to get a barn if he wants to buy livestock. John believes that building a barn will take at least six months, so Uncle suggests that he could buy a pre-cut barn and they head over to the lumber yard. John greets Albert Cakes and tells him that he needs a barn, so Albert opens a catalogue of pre-cut buildings and John picks out one. John and Uncle thank Cakes for the help.
John and Uncle head to the bank, where Ansel Atherton tells John that he wants to help him but can not help give him another loan and gets annoyed by Uncle's behavior. The pair leave and John yells at Uncle for being annoying to Atherton. Sadie appears and greets them. John asks Sadie if she has any work as he needs money to pay off his loan to the bank. Sadie states that she has a job and it's dangerous. Sadie lets John join her. Sadie states she received a bounty she is after is located at Painted Sky. She states that she received a tip from an encyclopedia salesman, who went to the property to look for the rancher to sell an encyclopedia, but saw a Mexican man on the property. Sadie tells John that the bounty she is going after is Ramón Cortez, a wanted Del Lobo gang member. Sadie and John talk during the travel, discussing the Skinner Brothers and John's new house. Once they arrive at Painted Sky, Sadie suggests to John to split up. Sadie heads to the house while John heads to the barn.
Sadie finds Wróbel tied to a chair and she unties him. Wróbel states that Cortez is hiding in the barn. When John enters the barn, Cortez ambushes him and the two men fight. John defeats him and Cortez surrenders. Sadie rushes over to John and hits Cortez with her shotgun. John carries the unconscious Cortez and places him on Sadie's horse. Sadie tells John that they are going to Scarlett Meadows Sheriff's Office in Rhodes. John is surprised by this and Sadie states that the environment there has changed. Cortez wakes up and attempts to bribe them to let him go and Sadie tells him to shut up.
They eventually arrive, Sadie heads to the sheriff office and tells John to bring Cortez. Cortez attempts to bribe John to kill Sadie, but John tells him to shut up. Sadie greets Sheriff Thomas and tells him that they have Cortez. Sheriff Thomas is pleased that they were able to capture Cortez. John places him into the cell and Cortez attempts to bribe all of them to let him go, but Sheriff Thomas tells Cortez that he and his deputies are taking him to Saint Denis to be hanged for his crimes. Sheriff Thomas tells Sadie and John to help him guard Cortez until his deputies arrive. Sheriff Thomas offers the two drinks and Cortez is seen laughing inside his cell. As they wait for the deputies, it becomes nighttime and Sadie and John rest.
The next day, John and Sadie wake up. The Del Lobo Gang arrive in Rhodes and demand Sheriff Thomas to release Cortez or they will kill them. John, Sadie and Sheriff Thomas fight the gang members in the town and defeat them. Sadie and John hear an explosion and rush over. Sheriff Thomas tells them that a Del Lobo blew a hole in the cell and Cortez escaped. Sadie tells Sheriff Thomas to give them the bounty money, even though Cortez escaped. Sheriff Thomas states that he does not have the money and will not get the money if he does not bring Cortez to Saint Denis. Sheriff Thomas tells them to get Cortez back and that he will add an extra $50 to Cortez's bounty, though he and Sadie haggle to $75 extra. Sadie and John search the area and Sadie spots a campsite and notices the gang members. Sadie tells John to come with her to the old water mill to get a vantage view.
Sadie notices that they are waiting for a boat. Sadie tells John she is going down to the campsite and that she will take care of the gang members. John provides sniper support from the mill and Sadie then calls to John to come down to help her. Sadie and John fight the gang members and they notice that Cortez is escaping in a row boat. John shoots at the boat, which forces Cortez to row the boat back to land. John ties Cortez up and John notices more gang members. Cortez sees them and calls out to them in Spanish. They defeat the remaining gang members and take Cortez back to Rhodes. Sadie calls out to the sheriff that they got him and John hands over Cortez to the deputies. Cortez is placed in a jail wagon. Sheriff Thomas tells them that they will get their money once he and his deputies arrive in Saint Denis. The sheriff and deputies leave with Cortez. Sadie thanks John and John asks her to send his money to the bank."

John and Charles wake to find that Uncle has been taken by the Skinner Brothers. The two must then find and rescue him from the extremely violent gang.","Overjoyed at having built a house of his own as well as a barn at Beecher's Hope, John celebrates with Uncle and Charles by getting drunk and participating in hilariously boisterous activities with the other two - John even going as far as playfully chasing Uncle with Charles on his back. The three sing, dance and make merriment with copious amounts of alcohol. After passing out on the floor of his new home, John is roused by Charles who urgently informs him that Uncle is nowhere to be seen.
The two find traces of the Skinner Brothers outside and deduce that Uncle has been kidnapped by the gang and is probably being held at their hideout. The two set off on the trail left by the Skinners, still unsure of Uncle's fate, with Charles darkly commenting on how they might have to put Uncle out of his misery depending on how grievously he's maimed and tortured. The duo sense their proximity to the gang camp and leave their horses to pursue the trail on foot.
After quietly killing a few patrolling Skinners, the two spot a gang member driving a wagon dragging along another victim through the ground. Charles and John follow the wagon driver who inadvertently leads them right into the Skinner hideout. After stealthily killing the driver who was attempting to dispose of a corpse, they find a boulder overlooking the gang camp. John uses his binoculars and spots Uncle tied to a spit, his bare back badly burned by the fire.
John is suddenly attacked by a Skinner but is saved by Charles. John returns the favor a moment later when Charles too gets attacked by another Skinner. The scuffle gives away their position and two begin fighting all the Skinners at the camp. John quickly unties Uncle and scouts ahead, defending Charles who is carrying Uncle. The two fight their way through more Skinners and soon reach their horses. Charles hoists Uncle on the back of his horse as John mounts his steed. The trio ride out of the woods, finishing off any stray Skinners. After finally reaching Beecher's Hope, Charles takes Uncle inside to be treated for his burns. John and Charles then briefly discuss the history of the Skinner Brothers, with Charles affirming that the ranch will now be safe since most of the gang was eliminated in the woods. Charles then heads back inside to nurse Uncle.
Later, John is performing various activities such as cleaning the barn, tending to his horse and purchasing several sacks of maize for farming. He suddenly spots two unexpected visitors."

They do agree they'd like to do more of this on the way, though. During their walk, Jack reminisces about the time Arthur took him fishing until the Pinkertons showed up.
When John and Jack arrive at the stream, they start to fish. After either John or Jack catches a fish, Jack notices that Rufus isn't nearby and starts looking for him. When they find Rufus, it looks like he's been bitten by a snake, and John has to suck out the poison on the dog's bad leg.

They leave to hunt down a bounty, Marshall Thurwell, in Tall Trees and discuss other men who have evaded their capture.","With his family now reunited at Beecher's Hope, John enters the living room to find Abigail knitting, one morning. He asks if she's pleased with his efforts, to which she responds that she's pleased, but doesn't forgive his past behavior in jest. Jack then calls his parents out to the front porch, to find that Sadie Adler has arrived to see them. Abigail, though confused as to how John knew Sadie had come, invites her in for lunch, overjoyed to see her again after 8 years.
Later, the group talk and eat together on the front porch. Abigail asks about Sadie's current job, learning that she works as a bounty hunter and gun-for-hire. Sadie attempts to offer a job to John to pay off his bank loans, assuring them that the work is safe, legal and well-paying. Initially, Abigail declines on John's behalf, but soon learns that John was doing exactly this, in his family's absence. John asserts that he desperately needed money and that bounty hunting was the only work he was capable of doing with his skills, but Abigail disapproves because of the danger it could bring to himself and the family, as well as the bad influence it could pose to Jack.
Sadie also reveals she's been tracking Micah down ever since his return to West Elizabeth. Abigail objects even more strongly to the prospect of hunting Micah, given how dangerous he is, his actions within the gang, and the gravity of the repercussions from confronting him. Sadie apologizes for mentioning Micah and backtracks to her original offer.
Abigail asks Sadie about the bounty: Marshall Thurwell, an accountant who robbed his employer in Rhodes and later fled to West Elizabeth. Sadie, once more, reassures Abigail that the job is low risk-high reward. Abigail relents and permits John to accompany Sadie on her bounty hunts, so long as he returns home safely, but maintains her stance on Micah. With Abigail's permission, John and Sadie head for Tall Trees. On the way there, Sadie praises John's efforts in building his ranch and reunion with his family. John also reveals that he intends to propose to and officially marry Abigail, with the engagement ring that Arthur had once proposed to Mary Linton with, long ago. Sadie expresses joy for John, noting how happy her own marriage made her.
Once at Tall Trees, they make their way to Thurwell's camp to search for any clues to his whereabouts, hoping that he hasn't been killed by the Skinner Brothers or the local wildlife. There, they find a set of tracks leading to a dilapidated cabin and find a man's mangled corpse, just outside. John and Sadie look upon the corpse, disturbed, wondering if he was their bounty or not. A voice calls out from the cabin, asking if ""it"" is gone. The pair aim their guns at the cabin, and ask if the man is Marshall Thurwell, which he confirms he is. Sadie states her intentions, who Thurwell is wanted by and why.
The pair order Thurwell to leave the cabin, to which he complies while asking if ""the monster"" is gone. Just as he exits, though, the aforementioned monster - revealed to be a giant, heavily scarred grizzly bear - comes out and charges at the pair, knocking them to the ground and frightening them. The bear then runs around and charges back at John, who tries to fire off as many rounds as he can from his gun, but is knocked to the ground, forced to fight for his life as the bear rips and tears at him. As soon as John manages to get the bear off of him, Sadie fires off a final warning shot, finally prompting the bear to clear off.
After the attack, Sadie helps John back on his feet, and go to deal with Thurwell once more. Both furious at what just transpired, and Thurwell's cowardice, Sadie knocks him out, and John ties him up. As the two head for Blackwater, they discuss the danger their work puts them in, with Sadie wondering if she should've brought John along, considering the consequences of any harm befalling him on his family. John reassures her that he took the job knowing the risks and needed the work. They also dispose of two bounty hunters who attempt to steal Thurwell from them, and discuss Micah. Sadie says that she should just take of him alone and that John should just be with his family and his new life, but John is determined to deal with Micah personally. Sadie tells him that rumor has it that Micah is not far away and promises to let John know where he is as soon as she hears something.
They arrive at the police station in Blackwater and drop off Thurwell. Sadie promises to send John's payment to the bank herself and John leaves."

Before they could leave the ranch, Duncan and Angus Geddes arrive, delivering old furniture to the Marstons' ranch in Beecher's Hope in gratitude for John saving Pronghorn Ranch from the Laramie Gang, much to John's and Abigail's appreciation. They go to Benjamin P. Lockhart's Photo Studio in Blackwater to take a photo, before entering the Imperial Theatre to view a ""moving picture"".

With the whereabouts of Cleet known in Strawberry, the gang saddles up looking for revenge.","Sadie shows up at the ranch with information that Cleet has been seen drinking in Strawberry and knows where Micah can be found, and asks Charles and John to join her.  Charles immediately agrees.  Abigail tries to decline on John's behalf, but he also agrees.  Abigail follows John inside as he gears up, pleading with him not to go, but he insists that the farm and everything they have wouldn't have been possible without Arthur, Sadie, and the many members of the gang that died along the way, and that he has no choice but to pursue Micah.  Sadie, Charles, and John ride from Beecher's Hope to Strawberry, where they find Cleet. After capturing him, the trio beat him, but he claims to not know where Micah is.  Sadie decides they should hang him, and they drag him to the nearby gallows and threaten to hang him if he doesn't reveal Micah's whereabouts, while townfolk gather around to watch the specticle. In the end, Cleet reveals that Micah and his gang are at Mount Hagen. John can then choose to hang Cleet or, if John decides to spare him, Cleet will be shot dead by Sadie.
The three travel to Mount Hagen, but as they begin to ascend the mountain, Charles is shot in the shoulder by a sniper and wounded. Sadie and John take cover and fight their way up the mountain with Charles in tow. At some point during the journey up the mountain, a group of Micah's men ambush them, and Sadie is stabbed in the torso before getting saved when her attacker is shot by Charles. Afterwards, she tells John that she isn’t dying and merely needs to rest, prompting him to keep going. Almost immediately, John is confronted by Joe and two other members of Micah's Gang but, in a single moment, Joe and his allies are gunned down by Marston, allowing the latter to continue.
Marston finally reaches Micah and engages him in a gunfight after a short conversation. While the two men are in a deadlock with neither able to gain the upper hand, Sadie manages to flank Micah from behind and holds him at gunpoint, forcing him to surrender. Before anything else can happen, Dutch suddenly walks out of Micah's cabin with his guns drawn. Sadie, surprised by the appearance of Dutch, lets her guard down and is taken hostage by Micah, who holds her by the neck and points his gun at John. Dutch also points one of his guns at John, who variously points his back at Micah and Dutch. John begs Dutch to help him, saying that he always did his best for him in the gang, even though Dutch accuses John of treachery during the gang’s final days. Dutch eventually turns and shoots Micah in the chest before holstering his revolvers. Shocked but impressed, Micah then tries to shoot John and Dutch, but John is quicker and shoots Micah multiple times, sealing his fate. Micah staggers for a few steps before collapsing dead in the snow, after which Dutch leaves, ignoring John's attempts to thank him. John and Sadie then find a fortune of money and gold inside the cabin, with most of it presumably being from the Blackwater ferry robbery that took place eight years prior.
John, Sadie, and Charles ride back to the ranch, where they return to Abigail and Jack. John tells her that it’s done, and the two are later finally married. Charles and Sadie eventually depart and are never seen again, with Charles saying he'll head north to Canada and try to start a family, and Sadie suggesting she might head to South America.

He warns the protagonist to leave for his own safety. The player does not know what he is talking about, and Obediah explains that there are ""demons,"" who are coming to attack the village. Very soon after, the player hears a cry for help from a nearby house and goes to investigate. The cry for help turns out to be coming from a woman whose pigs are being attacked by mangy, rabid dogs, who then proceed to attack the player on sight. The player is forced to kill the rabid animals in self-defense, then saves two other villagers who are under attack in other parts of the village as well.
After killing the seemingly rabid dogs, the player tells the villagers to urgently get inside their homes, but Obediah states that a man told him that the demons will come in many forms and protection would come in many forms. The player tells him that it is just sick dogs, poisoned or sick with ""hydrophobia"", and tells the villagers to shoot any sick animals. Obediah tells the player that they can not doubt the mentioned man, who told them that evil has plagued the village. A ""shaman"" suddenly appears and claims that he can save them. The shaman tells Obediah and the others that the curse has changed and a collection of cursed dark charms in the woods are protecting the curse. The player asks the man whether the curse would be lifted if the charms were to be destroyed. The shaman tells him that the woods are plagued with demons and it is impossible to destroy them since they are protected by demons. The shaman tells Obediah and the others that the player is lying about there not being a curse.

The player decides to investigate the nearby forest and destroy the cursed dark charms, numbering 13 in total. These charms can be found hanging from the branches of trees in the area. They make a jingling noise when the player is near and will briefly ping on the mini-map as red dots. They will also be highlighted when using Eagle Eye, both flashing and having the bright yellow ""scent"" plume above them otherwise seen during legendary animal hunts and certain missions that involve tracking. Shotguns and explosive ammo are quite effective at destroying them.
The Wisdom of the Elders IV[]
Obediah will be sitting on the front porch of his house alongside the shaman. The player tells him that he has destroyed the charms and the shaman is in disbelief. Obediah is overjoyed that the player has destroyed the charms. The shaman interrupts them and claims that the player has ""set the curse loose"", thus making the curse even worse than before. The player recalls that the man stated that the curse would be lifted if the charms were to be destroyed. Obediah seems to be confused by all this. The player tells Obediah that the shaman is clearly hiding something from them but the shaman retorts that the player is telling lies and that the shaman has the gift of communing with spirits and demons. The player threatens the shaman, causing him to runs off to ""commune with the spirits"", screaming about dark omens. Obediah recalls an abandoned mine on the other side of a hill to the north, which the shaman had told him and others to avoid, so the player sets off to investigate.
The Wisdom of the Elders V[]
The player locates the abandoned mine and breaks their way in, but as they proceed deeper into the darkened tunnel, the player will begin coughing as the air becomes more difficult to breath. Once they reach the bottom of the mine, they find that the mine is flooded with tainted water contaminated by highly toxic runoff from the wall of the mine, leaching off into the water from the rock walls around. The air is thick with toxic fumes, causing the player to begin coughing even more. The player decides to take a sample of the contaminated water using a nearby glass bottle.
The player then hears someone nearby and tells them to get out, as the mine is poisoned. Soon after, a dynamite charge goes off, causing the entrance to cave in and leaving the player trapped in the poison-ridden tunnel. With the oxygen flow from the surface cut off, the fumes flood into the area and reach deadly concentrations, causing the player to begin suffocating, causing loud and hoarse coughing and draining their health at a constant pace as they choke on the poison. The player must now quickly escape by following the contaminated runoff water through another tunnel, eventually reaching another area where sunlight and fresh clean air reaches into the underground, stopping the suffocation. Continuing onwards, they eventually reach the surface from behind the waterfall at Kamassa River. During the escape from the mine, the player can find two corpses of deceased miners in the escape tunnel, which can be looted for a Gold Nugget and a Gold Tooth, respectively (note that looting the bodies is considered grave robbing and will lower your Honor).  In addition, a Miner's Hat can be found next to the first body, and two Little Brown Bat carcasses (in good and perfect condition) can be found just before reaching the waterfall.
After escaping the deadly mine, the player heads back to the village, where they see the shaman with the villagers. The shaman wants Obediah to sign some papers that he claims will lift the curse. Obediah decides to read aloud the papers before signing, to the shaman's surprise, as he did not know Obediah could read. By reading the paper, Obediah reveals that the shaman is working for the Roanoke Fuel Company, and is trying to fool the villagers into signing a paper that would eliminate any responsibility of the company for poisoning the Butcher's Creek area with the mine the player just escaped from, and waive any right the villagers have to suing the company for damages. The shaman quickly tells Obediah to stop reading the document. The player decides to confront the shaman over this and Obediah is surprised that they survived. The player claims that the shaman purposely tried to kill them when investigating the mine, before pulling out the sample of the poisonous runoff water and telling the villagers that they were poisoned.
Obediah and the villagers still doubt the player's claims, with the shaman claiming that the substance is ""nothing"", so the player decides to shove said substance down his throat, reasoning that if it is nothing, then nothing should happen. The shaman clutches his belly and cries out that he's been poisoned, then admits that the company was digging a mine and discovered that there was only arsenic and lead in the ground, and that they hired him to get the villagers to leave. This increases Obediah's and the others' paranoia, and they start to believe that higher spirits have cursed the village through a mining company and that they should appease them through prayer, despite the player's attempts to get them to do something practical about the issue. Obediah tells the player to leave and offers the money the shaman left behind as a reward. The player's Honor is also raised."

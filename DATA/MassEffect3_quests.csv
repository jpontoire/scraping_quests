Quest,Acquisition,Walkthrough
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Tuchanka:_Turian_Platoon,"Prerequisite: Priority: Sur'Kesh
The mission is acquired immediately upon return from Sur'Kesh.
Primarch Victus brings to Shepard's attention a ship the turians have lost contact with, the details of which he would rather discuss away from the ears of the nearby Urdnot leader. A NavPoint on Tuchanka becomes available on the Galaxy Map afterwards, ready for investigation. If Shepard talks to Victus on the War Room, the primarch emphasizes that it's classified and says just enough to change the journal entry.
Once acquired, it will remain available until the completion of Priority: Thessia, after which it becomes inaccessible, and is considered failed.","Once on the ground, you will contact Lieutenant Victus, who tells you he is under attack from Reapers and will shoot up a flare to tell you where to go. Proceed forward and pick up the SMG Magazine Upgrade on the left. Then climb up the ladder. Proceed forward to the three Husks, and kill them. Then salvage the Spare Parts (3,125 credits) buried in the rubble and climb up the next ladder. Continue forward, jump over the gap and pick up the M-9 Tempest next to some dead turians near a crashed turian escape pod.
First Escape Pod[]
Surprise on your side for a change
Continue forward and you will get a chance to ambush three Cannibals. While you are fighting them two more will appear, and may attempt to flank you in the circular room so watch your right flank. Once they are all dead, a Harvester will appear. It will flee once about 75% damaged. You may be able to kill it, but if you do, you may trigger a bug (see bugs section below) that prevents completing the mission. Drive it off before it takes out the escape pod for a bonus 300 experience, plus compliments from your team.
You can't get across to where the turians were, so turn right and climb up the ladder. At the top, just to your left will be a Sniper Rifle Spare Thermal Clip. Step down from the ledge and continue forward to salvage some spare parts (6,250 credits), then backtrack slightly and take the path that was to your right. On the ground ahead of you will be the Phaeston assault rifle. Keep going forward and turn left at the dead-end T-junction to pick up some SMG Ultralight Materials. Return back to the other hallway and go down the ladder.
Second Escape Pod[]
Head straight ahead and pick up the med-kit on the right across from a dead turian. Keep going forward and around the corner. Sneak up on the Marauder and Cannibals and take them out. Again a Harvester will fly in, this time dropping off some husks for you to fight. Chase it off quickly for another bonus 300 experience, plus compliments from your team. Since you can't get to the turians, turn right and drop off the ledge. Lieutenant Victus will come in over comms asking about your ETA. Proceed forward and pick up the Hahne-Kedar chestplate on your left. Another drop down and you will find a flight recorder on the ground on the right. Slightly farther ahead on the left will be a Shotgun Smart Choke. As you approach the open area, another Harvester will drop some husks and fly off. Take them out and salvage the Junk (3,125 credits) on the dead turians before going down the ladder.
Harvester Battle[]
Tarquin Victus tries to put some fight back in his men
The same Harvester will then drop off some Cannibals and Marauders. Take them out and chase the Harvester off. Continue forward, down the ramp, and around to the right to find a med-kit on the ground near a fire. Drop off the ledge ahead to find a Sniper Rifle Extended Barrel. You will see some combat in the distance to your left.
After a final drop off a ledge, you'll see a fairly open area to your left, the site of this mission's final battle. You may wish to make a save before proceeding.
Warning:  It is possible for one or both squadmates to get stuck on the ledge of the final drop into this area, preventing them from fully joining you in the upcoming fight. If this happens, reloading a save can un-glitch them.
As you round the corner into the area, you and your squad unleash a few war cries as several waves of Cannibals and Marauders start dropping in, also accompanied by a Brute, which you should prioritize taking out.
Note:  Move forward along the right to find a Reaper Blackstar heavy weapon that will greatly help in taking out the Harvester that shows up eventually and serves as the ""final boss"" of the mission.
A squadmate will call out when the Harvester reappears during the battle. Pay attention to the L-shaped cover in the corner in the left part of the battlefield. It can protect you from frontal attacks, flank attacks, and the Harvester's blasts (though not grenades). The central pillar located between this cover and the Harvester blocks line of sight to the Harvester leaving it without targets. Enemies will continue to spawn at this point, but their supply is not infinite, so you might want to focus on eliminating all minor enemies before going after the Harvester, though the explosion that occurs upon the Harvester's death will kill all enemies that remain, instantly ending the fight.
When you're done, move forward and talk to Victus. You will receive Tuchanka: Bomb, a timed mission, and will return to the Normandy. Talk to Hackett, who will give you 12,500 credits, and then talk to Primarch Victus."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Hades_Nexus:_Prothean_Sphere,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II
Listen to the refugee in Bay E28 on Docks: Holding Area or point #4 on the area map. He's begging the turian guard for some food in exchange for the location of Prothean ruins.
Alternatively, a Search and Rescue operation in the Hades Nexus will yield the sphere and this mission's journal entry. In this case it is labeled Citadel: Prothean Sphere.","Help the bald guy get some food (and some soap - those are dirty hands) by turning over the artifact to him
The Hades Nexus only becomes available after Priority: Rannoch. That is a gap of at least 4 Priority missions from earliest mission acquisition to mission completion: pretty sure the refugee's family will be starving for quite a while even if you decide to help ASAP. Scan Gei Hinnom in Sheol in the aforementioned cluster. Give the artifact to the refugee when you return to the Citadel: you'll instruct him to sell the artifact to the Alliance on Shepard's authority.
After handing over the artifact, you will gain 5 Reputation, 15,000 credits and an update to the Alliance Engineering Corps War Asset. If you talk to the refugee again, it turns out he used the money to buy food not only for himself and his family, but also for some others who are also trapped on the station."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Improved_Power_Grid,"Prerequisite: Priority: Palaven
Prerequisite: N7: Cerberus Attack
Alison the technician can be found to the right of the Purgatory entrance looking at a datapad in her left hand. Listen to her complaints to acquire the mission.
Alternatively, both the item and the mission's journal entry can be acquired during a sortie against Cerberus on Tuchanka.","Note: This mission must be completed before doing Priority: Tuchanka as it will be the last opportunity to visit the Citadel in its present state. It is no longer available the next time the civilian areas reopen, after Priority: The Citadel II.
Blocky krogan computers? Still far more powerful than the one you're using now
The schematics can be obtained examining the Old Grid Schematics on the console in front of the controls for the cannon during the N7: Cerberus Attack mission on Tuchanka. Shepard quips it's not the kind of krogan ""relic"" they expected to find. Note:  It is temporarily unobtainable when Cerberus cuts the power to the consoles, then available again once you've restored the power. Take the schematics before using the cannon to demolish the Cerberus cruiser in orbit, which ends the main mission.
If you didn't retrieve the power grid schematics from the mission you can buy an equivalent from Spectre Requisitions in the Citadel Embassies for 1,000 base credits.
Whichever way you acquired the schematics, turn over the item to Alison, who is still standing outside Purgatory. Completing this mission gives you 5 Reputation, 30 experience and 1,000 credits. It also updates the Alliance Fifth Fleet War Asset.
Interacting with Alison after turning in the power grid plans allows you to overhear Alison's continued call, where she suggests donating a portion of Purgatory's profits to a krogan charity, in gratitude for designing the new power grid."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Kakliosaur_Fossil,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II
Prerequisite: Priority: Geth Dreadnought
Listen to the salarian talking at the Apartments of the Presidium Commons. He is standing outside of Apartment 90, discussing how the krogan would benefit if they had the currently extinct kakliosaurs to aid them in battle.
If you never listened on his comm conversation, the mission objective and journal entry are obtained during a Search and Rescue operation in Argos Rho.","The war strategist gesticulates on reinvigorating this Earth film franchise called Jurassic Park in 2186
The Argos Rho cluster only becomes available after the Geth Dreadnought's destruction over Rannoch. Scan the planet Intai'sei in the Phoenix system of the said cluster. After gaining the artifact (a kakliosaur skull), speak to the salarian War Strategist, who's still standing outside the apartment. He quips that kakliosaur DNA is remarkably pliable and the cloning facilities on Sur'Kesh should have battle-ready units produced quickly.
Completion of the mission gives you 5 Reputation, 15,000 credits, and updates the Krogan Clans War Asset. Further eavesdropping on salarian indicates that the krogan have already begun riding the kakliosaurs into battle and don't mind how the creatures mark their territory."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Omega:_Assist_Harrot,"When entering Aria's Bunker following the operation to gain the aid of the Talons, the elcor Harrot has appeared next to a Harrot's Emporium terminal. In order to gain Aria's favor, Harrot asks Commander Shepard to retrieve Aria's old couch, which Oleg Petrovsky had thrown out of Afterlife after the Cerberus conquest of Omega.
Note that if Shepard refuses this mission, Shepard will not have the ability to alert Harrot upon encountering the couch.","Aria staring at her couch
At the beginning of The Assault on Afterlife segment of the mission Omega: Aria T'Loak, defeat the Cerberus forces in the water treatment facility. When the bridge across the water channel is destroyed, raise the dam and cross it to the other side. Immediately on your right, there should be an access ladder on the side of the catwalk that descends into the part of the channel that was just drained. Climb down, and beneath the destroyed bridge are the remains of Aria's couch in a pile. If you interact with the couch Aria will ask: ""Is that my couch?"", and the mission will be completed."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Medical_Supplies,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II
After returning to the Normandy from the Citadel you will be notified by Specialist Traynor that the medical officer (either Dr. Chakwas or Dr. Michel) wishes to speak with you. Go speak to her.","Time to use some tact on Tactus. Or just yell at him, whatever works.
Go to the Docks: Holding Area in the Citadel and head to the refugee medical center in Cargo Hold B. There you will find a turian named Tactus on the right hand side. When you talk to him, he recognizes you but states he is unwilling to give away the refugees' medical supplies due to a combination of his distrust of the Alliance, the dire situation of his people, and the high value of the supplies.
If you have enough reputation, you'll be able to convince Tactus to trade supplies as Chakwas/Michel had suggested by emphasizing either the potential mutual benefits or the stark military realities. If those dialogue options aren't available or you want a larger morality point reward, you can give your supplies away asking nothing in return for +15 Paragon points. Asking Tactus to reconsider will result in his refusal, as he states he can likely get a better offer from the black market, though you can still talk to him again later to reopen the discussion.
If you successfully negotiate a trade, speak with the medical officer to finish this mission. If you haven't yet brokered the trade, the doctor simply tells you it would be good if you did, and the mission remains open in the Journal."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Priority:_The_Citadel_II,"Prerequisite: Priority: Tuchanka
The mission is acquired immediately after dealing with the genophage and is triggered by the first visit to the Citadel after that, thus causing almost all uncompleted Citadel-related side-missions to expire. See the preparatory notes on Priority: Tuchanka for details.
Priority: Citadel II itself is a ""point of no return"" for Grissom Academy: Emergency Evacuation, which must be completed prior or it will become unavailable and be considered failed.
Finally, although it is not possible to visit the normal Citadel locations between Priority: Tuchanka and the completion of Priority: Citadel II, purchasing items from the procurement interface in the Normandy's Shuttle Bay is still allowed. It is also possible to visit the newly unlocked N7: Cerberus Fighter Base or any other side missions before heading to the Citadel.","The mission begins when the Normandy approaches the Citadel but is not cleared for landing. Joker contacts someone inside the Citadel—either Thane Krios, or Armando-Owen Bailey—who explains the situation: Cerberus has attacked and partially taken over the station, including C-Sec Headquarters and the Docks. Shepard deploys with a team in the shuttle to clear them out.
Note: Thane will appear in this mission only if he is alive and he was talked to prior to completing Priority: Tuchanka.
C-Sec HQ[]
If he's breathin' he's workin'
Shepard lands outside C-Sec HQ, and must fight uphill against Cerberus Assault Troopers, Combat Engineers, and Centurions supported by Shield Pylons at the far wall. Don't advance down the central path just yet as there is a Turret already in place there—you can take it out from where you were dropped off without getting hit. Be aware that once most of the initial enemies are cleared out and you approach Bailey, more Troopers will jump down from directly above the locked door.
Tip: Right when you're dropped off, instead of taking cover directly ahead, there are areas directly behind you and also to the left that may give you more room to maneuver and put you out of reach of any grenades.
Once you've actually cleared out the area, head up the ramp and access the medical station on the left of the door, before talking to Bailey. There will be a short cut scene where Bailey briefly explains what happened. Bailey lets you inside C-Sec HQ, where he discovers that the salarian councilor (Valern if you saved the Council during Sovereign's attack; Esheel otherwise) has likely taken refuge in the C-Sec Executor's office. If Garrus is in the party he will note that the councilor mentioned Udina and that the executor's office is a defensible location. Bailey directs Shepard's party to the office; Shepard will also converse with Thane if Thane is still alive.
Inside C-Sec[]
Cerberus sure likes their sleeper agents
Go through the two doors behind Bailey to see two Assault Troopers across the hall with their backs to you. Once you take them out, two Guardians and an Engineer will come down the stairs on the left. Go up the stairs. To the right, you'll find a terminal, a Med Kit, and an Assault Rifle Piercing Mod.
As you advance farther into the room, two Assault Troopers will crash down from ahead, then two more after that. After you take care of them, examine the C-Sec Corpse to find it was another inside job like Mars. Bypass the door to continue. Opening the second door, take out the Guardian looking the other way. There's two Centurions blocked from view on the left of the Guardian and a Combat Engineer in the elevated room on his right. Once clear, loot the Recon Hood from below the big screen to the left. The bathroom to the left contains the M-76 Revenant beneath the first sink, and a locker (+6250 credits). Examine the C-Sec Corpse on the bathroom floor for comments from your squadmates, disgusted at Cerberus. Finally, there is a Medical Station on the wall next to the room's exit.

Facing the wall during an urban assault is never a good idea
As you walk along the corridor, an intercom goes off. Through the broken windows to the left, you'll see a Combat Engineer with his back to Shepard. Take him out, and jump into the room to grab the Sniper Rifle Extended Barrel on the shelf. There's also a weapon bench if you want to change your setup. Break the latch on the elevator controls (if it wasn't destroyed during the fight with the Engineer), and activate the elevator.
As you take the elevator, Bailey asks about any survivors. There won't be anything to shoot in the next area, so just pick up the items: a Pistol Piercing Mod in the room on the right, along with a terminal of Bailey's Personal Log; the M-25 Hornet down the middle passage on a C-Sec corpse right before the malfunctioning door; a Securitel Helmet and Pistol High-Caliber Barrel mod in the small room next to the locked door on the left side. To open this door, go to the room next to the malfunctioning door and use the first terminal for the Door Control. You'll find a datapad describing the actions of a weapons smuggler and a possible conspiracy, as well as a sample of said weapon, the M-358 Talon. Finally, go back to where you found the Door Control to exit this area. On the way out, salvage the 'Account Detail' terminal for 6250 credits.
Reaching the Executor's Office[]
Spot the councilor in this picture
On the other side of the door you'll find two more preoccupied Cerberus soldiers, this time executing a C-Sec sleeper agent who has now ceased to be useful. Take them out and enter a cafe area, with the kitchen on your right. This is one of the better places to hole up, because a number of Cerberus soldiers will flood in and you have to fight them off. Just beware that there's a set of stairs leading downward in the middle of the room, and to clear the enemy from it you'll need to physically go there. It might also be wise to post one of your teammates in the hallway next to the kitchen, so that Cerberus can't flank you from there.
Two medical stations, one inside the kitchen and one on the far wall, are available if you need the help. There's also 6250 credits against the back wall of the kitchen, a Sniper Rifle Piercing Mod near the far wall (you'll likely see it during the firefight), and—for a bit of flavor—a flatscreen TV in the corner of the cafe broadcasting a news report. It's Khalisah al-Jilani, covering C-Sec's attempts to reclaim the Citadel's comm towers so that they can send a distress call. She is doing her part by looping footage in her broadcast range, attempting to contact C-Sec to gather reinforcements.

Kai Leng[]
Greetings and goodbye
Up the stairs against the back wall, you'll find the executor's office. He's dead, but the salarian councilor is nowhere in sight. A disturbance in the cafe area you just left alerts your squad members to the place, revealing the councilor who was under cloak the whole time. Before you can get down there, Kai Leng will arrive to ruin your party. The salarian councilor gets out the critical information that Udina is planning a coup before one of several things happens:
If Thane is alive and was met at Huerta Memorial prior to this mission, he will intervene and put up a fight against Leng, saving the salarian councilor but getting stabbed in the process.
If Thane is not around but Captain Kirrahe survived the events of Virmire, Leng will attempt to kill the councilor, but a cloaked Kirrahe will take the blow instead, dying in the process. As he was never a member of the Normandy's crew, Kirrahe's name will not appear on the ship's Memorial Wall.
If neither character is around to intervene, Leng will kill the councilor.
Note:  If a Mass Effect 2 save has not been imported, neither Thane or Kirrahe will be present.
Shepard calls Bailey, and Bailey unlocks a C-Sec police car for Shepard's pursuit. Using transponders, Bailey determines that Udina is leading the Council to a landing pad near Shalmar Plaza, where Kai Leng is presumably waiting for them. In his spare time, though, Leng decides to interfere with Shepard by attacking the police car with his sword. This proves effective, damaging the vehicle and putting Shepard's party on foot in the Commons.
Presidium Pursuit[]
Cerberus sure likes to make an entrance
This next fight may be the first time you'll be facing two dangerous Cerberus foes: Phantoms, who have biotic barriers, are extremely agile and have a melee-range one-hit-kill; and Nemeses, who are shielded and have a powerful sniper rifle that can destroy shields or down fragile squadmates like Liara in one shot. Keeping your distance, or using disables on them like Concussive Shot, Carnage or biotics such as Stasis or Dominate, is your best bet against them. It is also possible to shoot and break a Phantom's sword, but this can be difficult without pinning them down with something like Stasis first.
The first area has a stairway that will allow you to circle around the Cerberus lines and attack them from behind, but this is not necessarily advantageous: both Phantoms and Nemeses are agile, and Phantoms are most dangerous at close range. On that note, the first Phantom you meet flips out of a shuttle that flies in from your right—be sure to give it a wide berth. Next you'll have to take a running-jump to a new section, but some Nemeses may have taken up station on the other side of the gap, so you may want to take them out first. More Nemeses and Phantoms appear once you're across, and this section has significantly less room to maneuver so you may want to consider leaping back across the gap. This creates an effective choke point, and if you have Stasis available, use it on enemies who attempt to jump the gap: they'll fall to their deaths when it expires.
Aerial shot of Shalmar Plaza
Head down the parking garage towards the door, which Cerberus will seal behind them. Jump the wall to your right and then keep heading up towards Shalmar Plaza using the Citadel's ""back alleys."" You'll find a datapad (+6250 credits) after jumping across a broken gap and going up some ledges on your left. To continue from that point on, put that pad behind you and you'll see the next alleyway. The next zone has an Atlas in addition to more troopers and an engineer.
Take out the Atlas ASAP as it continuously spams smoke grenades to conceal itself and its allies; there's plenty of cover on your left judging from your initial point of entry to the scene, and even with smokescreens you can hardly miss its bulky frame. Not far ahead is the stairs to an elevator that will take you to the Council; an alternative strategy is to simply ignore most or all of the enemies altogether and run for it.
Stop Council Elevator[]
Elevator music
The final combat zone of the mission can be easy because enemy reinforcements approach via elevator cars, all of which have Power Conduits on the top and bottom that you can shoot out, halting the lift car's progress entirely. However, this zone can also be challenging because the cars come from both sides, and some contain Phantoms. There is also no room for maneuvering and very little cover. There will be three elevators that need to be taken out, coming from Shepard's right, then left, then right again.
Snipers will want to shoot cars as they arrive. There is not much margin for error, but the tasks themselves are not difficult. Time dilation via Adrenaline Rush, the Sniper Rifle Concentration Mod, or Operational Mastery will give you more time to line up shots, or, simply spray away with a high-rate-of-fire weapon—there's enough time to reload between elevators and there is no further combat in this mission unless a Power Conduit is not destroyed in time. Overload, Energy Drain, and other instantly-hitting powers are especially effective when used by Shepard; other powers that launch projectiles may miss the mark due to the elevator's movement. Squadmate powers will hit the target instantly, making their powers (including grenades) more useful for stopping the elevators. You will gain 60XP each time you knock out an elevator.

Final Confrontation[]
The last elevator holds the Councilors as well as the Virmire survivor (Ashley Williams or Kaidan Alenko), who detects your landing once you jump onto the cab and immediately fires at you through the roof. The Council and Ashley/Kaidan quickly exit the elevator, only to find their escape shuttle destroyed. As Ashley/Kaidan orders their return to the elevator, Shepard and squad finally reach them, jamming the elevator door behind them to stall Cerberus' forces.
Humanity's second Spectre now stands between you and the Council, gun raised.
A Paragon interrupt allows you to de-escalate the situation by lowering your own weapons, but other than that it's all about trust. A variety of factors determine whether Ashley/Kaidan can be talked down. Starting at 0, the following table details the choices that influence the Virmire survivor's overall trust level:
Factor

Yes

No


Romanced Ashley/Kaidan in Mass Effect

+2

+0


• Cheated on them in Mass Effect 2

−1

+0


Saved the Council in Mass Effect

+1

−1


Kept Kirrahe or Thane alive through to Mass Effect 3 and save the salarian Councilor (otherwise Udina will produce a fabricated video of Shepard assassinating the salarian Councilor)

+0

−2


Shepard was kind to Ashley/Kaidan during Priority: Mars

+1

−1


Visited Ashley/Kaidan in the hospital once (when they were awake)

+2

+0


• Admitted and/or apologized for cheating on Ashley/Kaidan (if Shepard did cheat on them in Mass Effect 2)

+0

−1


• Visited them in the hospital a second time

+1

+0


Lowered their weapons against Ashley/Kaidan during the final confrontation

+1

+0
Final trust level:
−1 or below
→ Ashley/Kaidan cannot be talked down


0–3
→ Reputation check


4 or higher
→ Ashley/Kaidan automatically sides with Shepard
""If we don't figure out something, 'maybe later' will be an epitaph on a mass grave of eleven billion.""
If Ashley/Kaidan sides with Shepard, they will stand down. Either they or Shepard will order Udina to step away from the console that controls the elevator doors; Udina refuses and the asari Councilor tries to stop him, only for Udina to shove her down and pull a gun on her. A Renegade interrupt allows Shepard to shoot Udina, with Ashley/Kaidan taking the shot if Shepard does not.
If Ashley/Kaidan doesn't trust Shepard sufficiently, they refuse to move and Shepard is forced to go through them. A Renegade interrupt will allow Shepard to pull the trigger; if it's not taken, a squadmate will do it instead. Shepard will then automatically shoot Udina."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Dr._Bryson,"Prerequisite: Mass Effect 3: Leviathan
Prerequisite: Priority: Palaven
Check your private terminal for a message from Admiral Hackett ordering Shepard to assist Dr. Garret Bryson as soon as possible.
Urgent message from Admiral Hackett
Commander, there's an Alliance researcher working on the Citadel named Dr. Garret Bryson. I need you to meet with him right away.

Dr. Bryson has uncovered important new information about Reapers that could have a direct bearing on the war. I'm officially directing you to support his efforts at the first possible opportunity. Please visit Bryson's laboratory on the Citadel at once.
Obtaining this mission starts the Mass Effect 3: Leviathan mission chain.","Travel to the Citadel. The location Dr. Bryson's Lab becomes available once this mission is obtained, so go there to begin this mission. On the Galaxy Map, this mission is labelled ""Meet Dr. Bryson"".
Didn't this walkthrough just claim there's no combat involved? Then why are there casualties?! Literally unplayable 0/10 won't ever trust again
The first few moments is introductions between Shepard and Dr. Bryson. He works for Task Force Aurora and their mandate is investigating myths and legends about the Reapers. You have opportunities to inquire about his mission and steer the conversation at no gain in morality points. Most of the team are out chasing leads, and Bryson beckons his assistant Derek Hadley for data on something called ""Leviathan"". Before Bryson can reveal more about this latest discovery, however, Hadley shoots him dead.
Hadley turns his pistol on you. A Paragon interrupt presents itself - taking or not taking it is purely dependent on player opinion, you won't die either way. Hadley is subdued, and C-Sec is contacted and arrives at the scene shortly afterward. EDI also comes in and helps sort through Dr. Bryson's files.
You now turn to interrogate Hadley, who has no memory of recent events. Again, no morality points whatever your conversation choices. Another interrupt, Renegade this time, can be taken, which has consequences on dialogue only.
Let's turn our attention away from the ominous creepy ball at the moment, the matter will be dealt with in due time
EDI suggests Hadley has been indoctrinated. Hadley explains his task force's activities, but once the conversation turns to Leviathan he seizes up and cryptically discourages Shepard from pursuing the matter before falling down unconscious. The C-Sec guards then take him out for medical attention.
EDI plays two video logs between Bryson and Hackett from the computer's logs. Bryson claims the Leviathan of Dis uncovered by the batarians is a Reaper, and the thing that killed it is the real ""Leviathan"". The second log indicates that the Reapers themselves are shadowing Bryson's teams in the search for this ""Reaper-killer"". Bryson formally requests assistance in tracking it down, and it appears Shepard is the help that was requested.
Upon completion of the playbacks, this mission is considered complete and disappears from the journal. The next mission is triggered.

Wrecking Machines
From: CU Engineering Club

Commander,

Your match got you quite a following here at the Citadel U. Engineering Club. When we heard you were in the arena, we polled the club for what kind of dream matchup they'd like to see. Funny thing--the votes came in and not a lot of people wanted Reapers or Cerberus. (I guess that's too much like the news.) They wanted to see you take down the geth, like the old days. So they're getting some friends together and I wanted to ask, could you do one just for us? Geth, on the Blasteroid map?

We can't really afford to pay you, and you're probably doing pretty well for yourself anyway as a big-time Spectre and all that, but some of the engineers here are in weapons research. Give us a game, and we'll make you a mod? Is that too gauche?

Thanks,
Dave Shanel
Anti-President, CU Engineering Club","You need to play a combat match in the Armax Arsenal Arena against geth on the Blasteroid map. This challenge is not mutually exclusive with other arena challenges and can be completed in the same match as other nonconflicting challenges, such as the Citadel Arena: Medi-Gel Challenge. However, since it is the first challenge you receive, you will not have all the match options available to you without completing non-mission matches.
The fans will send a follow-up e-mail after successful completion of the match. After you read the e-mail, you'll receive the SMG Power Magnifier weapon mod and +2 Reputation points.
RE: Wrecking Machines

That was cosmic! There's nothing like seeing you on a wallscreen with people throwing corn chips and booing every time a geth makes a hit.

As mentioned, our engineering club went to town trying to make a mod for you. Enjoy!

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Silver_Coast_Casino:_Infiltration,"Prerequisite: Citadel: Identity Theft I
The mission's journal entry is acquired after entering the target casino.","Silver Coast Casino Floor[]
Brooks is required for this mission, EDI is not allowed into the casino because she's a mech/AI, so pick one of any other team mates. Since there's no shooting or fighting in this one, pick anyone you fancy, because their role is to distract the security at your call, or provide some comedic banter along the way.
Black tie required. None of them are wearing it.
Shepard and the team get the red carpet treatment upon arriving and they just smile and wave. The dialogue here will vary depending on certain factors, including Shepard's gender, who you have with you, if you're currently romancing the person you brought with you, and if you had your scars healed or left unhealed.
Once you are inside, move up the stairs and onto the casino floor. You will only have control of your other squadmate as Brooks will head directly for the shaft. Mingle with the guests for a little bit. Brooks will eventually call you up because there is a problem. Head up the stairs and to the shaft.
Tip: There are several more periods during this mission where you are waiting for Brooks to contact you to continue. If for any reason you want to speed through, saving then reloading the save should skip the waits.
Play cat-and-mouse with some security cameras for extra credits
Once you find Brooks, she mentions there is an alarm on the grate. Brooks gives Shepard a pair of resonance emitter lenses, provided by Liara, which allows Shepard to see and follow underground circuits. These lenses cause Shepard's eyes to appear yellow for the remainder of the mission. Also, if Shepard is an Engineer, Brooks will comment on this and your technical expertise.
Be careful when in visual range of guards or cameras as your security threat will rise if you make it too obvious what you are doing. Follow the blue wiring. The junction box is at the other end of the upper level guarded by a camera. Liara will upload a program to bypass the camera, but once you start don’t take too long as it doesn’t last very long. Bypass the box and Brooks will get in. Since this could take a while, mingle a bit more.
On the roulette side, you get two guards on alert. On the varren race side, you got a camera and a single patrolling guard.
After mingling a bit more, Brooks runs into another problem: there is a guard right beneath her. Distract him for a bit to allow her to pass. Shepard will tell the guard there is a red sand user in the bathroom and he will move to confront them. Brooks will radio she is clear, so back to mingling. Be careful to avoid setting things off. There are two ATMs on the ground floor you can get at for 3000 credits each and some Renegade points, but you have to bypass the respective cameras to do so.
When Brooks contacts you again, she has run into two problems. EDI and Liara come up with a solution, this time requiring you to follow red wiring. They lead to opposite sides of the casino: a terminal near the roulette tables, and another near the varren race tables. On the left is the pressure pad. You have to distract a guard and a camera. Send your squadmate to distract the guard, bypass the camera, then the security device. You have now two problems, two guards. Send your squadmate to distract one, the stationary one, and watch the patrolling one for the right moment. Be careful when you try and go, because if you get seen, you become suspected. Mingle immediately or it will be critical mission failure.
After bypassing them both, Brooks says that she is at the panic room and will be bypassing the lock. However, she misses one of the security devices and gets caught. EDI tells Shepard that she can call the guard to tell them it is a false alarm, but you need to reach him before that happens. It is the same guard that you talked to earlier. Once that is over, Brooks will radio she is clear so get back to talking and playing games if you feel like it.
To get to the safe room, be mindful of the timing and the guards' attention.
Brooks will finally radio she is in and now you need to meet her. There is one camera that you need to take care of, yellow wiring this time. This area is filled with two guards and two cameras. You can’t do anything about the patrolling guard, but you need to do something about the stationary one. Just keep an eye on the former. You have to be fast.
Once the patrolling guard turns away from the first camera junction box, move. Send your squadmate to distract the stationary guard, then bypass the first and second boxes, while keeping an eye on the patrolling guard. Then hurry and bypass the camera box while ensuring you are out of visual range of both guards. Once you are done, you are inside.
Safe Room[]
Once inside the safe room Shepard tells Khan they are going to have a talk, except Khan can’t talk because he is dead. Brooks manages to get into the terminal, but finds a deletion order on it. Brooks starts to beat herself up but Shepard calms her and then examines the terminal for mistakes. Bingo. They wiped the terminal but not the comm. Shepard activates the comm and a face appears on the screen over the mantel, distorted beyond recognition through signal degradation.
Follow the conversation. Eventually the figure says that they will take everything that Shepard is and everything they own. As the conversation cuts, Brooks says she couldn't trace the call. Shepard orders them to remove the drives and get them back so EDI can analyze them."

Unusual Scores
From: AAA Information Technology Dept.

Commander Shepard,

Here in the arena IT department, we are attempting to isolate a bug in the simulator. The bug causes unusual scores to show up, probably due to a memory leak. We are looking for a competitor who can reliably rack up high scores to serve as a paid consultant for the duration of our tests. We think you would make an excellent baseline!

If you are interested, the aspect that needs testing most is a layout with memory-intensive creatures like the super elite level opponents. Selecting those enemies should help us isolate the leak.

We look forward to working with you.

Early Testing Results
From: AAA Information Technology Dept.

Commander Shepard,

Our analysis of your simulator playtest revealed some interesting results. Memory-intensive creatures don't seem to be the problem.

We're thinking the unusual scores might be coming from an error in the bonus-generator code. To help us test, could you enter a match with all the limitations for maximum bonuses? Understandably, you may want to try it with lower-powered opponents.

You will receive a Sniper Rifle High-Velocity Barrel after reading the e-mail. Since the IT team hasn't figured out the problem, do as they ask. Select every positive bonus modifier and complete the match. All other settings regarding enemy type, difficulty, and squad are up to you.
Did IT figure out the problem? Check the terminal to find out they think they're getting close:
Memory Leak Isolated
From: AAA Information Technology Dept.

Commander Shepard,

Interesting news! The memory leak isn't caused by scoring at all. There's a program running in the background that is siphoning off resources.

We're not certain of the full extent of the errors the program introduces--the running joke is that our arena was constructed on an old Prothean burial ground. We'll need a live test to find out more. Please test the Spin Zone map against geth elites with their enhanced enemy shields enabled. We think that by doing so we'll have a good shot at discovering what the real problem is.

Just as a precaution, we've attached a waiver to this message for you to sign. It's mostly a formality to say your next of kin will not litigate.

See you inside!

You'll be rewarded with the Pistol Power Magnifier weapon mod for your troubles up to this point. Next, change the settings as asked: ""Spin Zone"" map, ""geth"" enemies, ""elite"" difficulty, and ""enhanced enemy shields"" bonus modifier. You can add other modifiers and choose your squad as you like and start the match.
It looks like they haven't fixed anything at all, and have, in fact, made it worse! The map is filled with incomplete digital artifacts and text reading ""Fatal Error,"" the announcer sounds strange, and the enemies that appear aren't geth at all—they're super-elite level Collectors. The next wave is super-elite level geth, then Cerberus, Reapers, and finally, a combination of all high-level boss enemies: Banshees, Praetorians, Geth Primes, and Atlases all in a single wave. You might find yourself reminiscent about Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer's Platinum difficulty, if you've played it. If your health and shields fall to zero, it will result in a Critical Mission Failure instead of the normal failed simulations which are not life-threatening.
Note:  Enemies can sometimes spawn high in the air and remain stuck there, and if this happens it can be a huge pain as those enemies have easy angles to hit you no matter where you try to hide. If you notice you're taking an especially heavy beating, look skyward. Reloading a save and trying the fight again may prevent this from occurring.
Congratulations, you have unlocked a glitchy map to play in
After you've made it through, the IT department will send you a final e-mail and the Assault Rifle Thermal Scope weapon mod. The Fatal Error map also becomes available to use on future arena matches.
Thank you for your service
From: AAA Information Technology Dept.

Commander Shepard,

I wanted to extend our company's sincere apologies that the last test put you in physical danger. We knew there was a potential risk, but we thought we could control the safety levels in case they nulled out. We have never been so wrong.

That said, your efforts managed to let us stabilize the level and we no longer have a memory leak. The simulator scores have been adjusted to their correct levels, putting you at the top of the leaderboard. And the fans seem to have enjoyed the unscripted brush with death.

If you continue to compete in the future, our team is happy to inform you that the layout, ""Fatal Error,"" has now been corrected so feedback is at safe levels. If you'd like to utilize it, we're pretty sure that audiences will tune in again.

Thanks for your service, Commander.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Attican_Traverse:_Krogan_Team,"Prerequisite: Priority: Sur'Kesh
The mission is acquired automatically upon return from Sur'Kesh. The journal entry is alternatively named as Attican Traverse: The Rachni, depending on your decision regarding the Rachni Queen in the original Mass Effect.
The Urdnot leader reports that some of his men went missing, the details of which he'd rather discuss ""in private"" (Urdnot Wreav) or ""somewhere else"" (Urdnot Wrex). A NavPoint for this mission is already on the galaxy map, but if the Urdnot leader is talked to in the War Room regarding this, you learn just enough to change the wording of the journal entry. The krogan heard troubling rumors about activity beyond the rachni relay. Scouts were dispatched, but have not reported since.","Meet up with the Krogan Team[]
Supply depots
Travel to the planet Utukku (Mulla Xul, Ninmah Cluster). Upon investigation you will meet up with Aralakh Company, led either by Grunt or (if he did not survive the suicide mission, or was never released from his tank in the first place) Urdnot Dagg.
At mission start, check the krogan temporary barracks structure on your left for the M-300 Claymore shotgun, a Pistol High-Caliber Barrel upgrade, and spare parts that you can salvage (+1625 credits).  Further down the slope you come to a cluster of krogan structures, enter the leftmost building with the weapon bench to find an SMG High Caliber Barrel upgrade, as well as spare parts for salvage (+875 credits) outside the same structure, near two krogan soldiers. If you come close to the edge, one of your squadmates will comment about the drop.
You can talk to Grunt/Dagg before entering the other building on the right. Once inside far enough, the building will fall down to the level of the tunnels and you will not be able to get back up to the krogan squad. You can only proceed forward, where you will find the body of a krogan scout and your first Firestorm.
Explore the Tunnels[]
Drop down over the ledge to use the Firestorm against the webbing; if you switch weapons, you will drop the Firestorm to the ground. Past the ledge and a few more webbings on the left, you will find spore pods. Destroy them from a distance with weapons or powers or they will damage your shields. Continue on and go up the ramp to find more spore pods, and in the hollow behind the second webbing another dead krogan scout with another Firestorm. Continue through the blue glowing goop, and take out a webbing. Tip: Before dropping down over the ledge, shoot out a Barrier Engine you can spot in the center of the large cavern ahead.
Encountering the Ravagers[]
A Ravager covers a Husk charge
Following a brief cutscene, you will now fight a Ravager and several Husks that may be protected by a barrier from a Barrier Engine. If you are playing through the campaign for the first time, this will likely be the first Ravager you have faced, so the quick rundown is: (1) when you see the blue laser-sighting glare, it means a triple burst from its deadly guns will soon follow; (2) when a Ravager goes down, do not step in the smoking acid pile left behind; and (3) do not ignore the spider-like Swarmers they create, as their damage can add up quickly and prevent your shields from recharging.
Beware the Ravager's powerful long-range shot while the Husks are attacking you. The strange rock shapes of the cover provided will increase the difficulty of this battle as well, and it's easy to get knocked out of cover by a Husk and then finished by the Ravager. Tip: If your party has area effect abilities and grenades, applying them immediately and liberally to the Husks will help simplify the situation and will vastly increase your chances for survival. There will be further grenade resupply opportunities before the final battle, so don't hoard them all.
Once you win the battle, you can find a Shotgun Shredder Mod along the left-hand wall. Proceed across the room, along the right is another scout next to some ammo, and in the center is a scout next to a Firestorm. At the top of the ramp are a lot of spore pods. You will get a view cue that confirms that reapers have been here. You will pass a blocked door on your left, and past more webbing will be a Reaper Node that you can destroy (400XP) to open the door. Take out the webbing past the door and the ceiling collapses trapping you on the far side.
Find the Krogan Team[]
Proceed forward, either up or down, it will take you to the same place. Then take out the webbing on the left so you can salvage some Reaper Tech (+3750 credits).
Note:  For the rest of this room, until a single Husk charges you, it is recommended that you burn off every spore pod from a safe distance before moving forward. This is because the Husk isn't dangerous by itself but it appears by surprise and can easily stampede you into a fatal encounter with a group of spore pods.
Past the Husk, take out the webbing on the left to find a dead krogan scout that will make Citadel: Krogan Dying Message available, though it will not appear in your Journal. The second webbing on the right will have another scout behind it with a replacement Firestorm. The way forward is to drop down into a large, cavernous room similar to where you had your first encounter with the Ravagers, so follow your own advice and ""expect trouble"". You may wish to make a save before dropping down. Tip: There's another Barrier Engine here that you can shoot first if you spot it—across the lake and a bit back.
Ravager Fight[]
The Reaper infestation runs deep
After you drop down and move forward a short distance, trouble shows up fast in the form of more Reaper troops. You should drop your Firestorm for the moment, as you won't be needing to clear out any spore pods until afterwards. This fight also comprises a Ravager plus several Husks, but now Cannibals also join the fray, adding the additional threat of incoming grenades. As before, Husks are a major threat because if they manage to grapple you, you'll be forced out of cover and made an easy target for the Ravagers and their Cannibal friends, so prioritize taking them out or at least disabling them to remove this threat; then take out the Cannibals to prevent any grenades from flushing you from your limited cover as well. The Ravagers are not really a threat as long as you are able to remain in cover and can be left to last.
Warning:  The drop into this area is too high for your squadmates to follow you normally by jumping down after you, and you can't order them over the drop to move into the area before you drop down first. Instead, the game ""teleports"" them to your position after you move forward into the area, which also usually triggers the fight. It is possible for your squad to glitch out and get stuck up in the previous area instead of joining you below, and if this happens, they will be unable to fight and will be sitting ducks for the Ravagers. If this occurs, it's recommended that you simply reload an earlier save, as this is a dangerous fight without your squad's help. Edging too cautiously into the area after you drop down seems the most common way to cause this glitch, so move forward decisively. Alternatively, moving around in circles a bit in the immediate area before moving forward too far can get your squadmates to you without triggering the fight.
After you finish them off, move forward cautiously as a second wave will appear further on. As before, you can take out another Barrier Engine before it can even activate: stay to the right as you leave the first watery area, and you will eventually come to a lake with a dead krogan and some ammo in it. Before you enter the lake, look across to the room beyond and you will see the third Barrier Engine on a rock.
Head across the room, but before you go down the ramp, pick up the Shotgun Spare Thermal Clip. Drop down over the ledge. Take out the gestation pods and your squad should take out the swarmers inside.
After taking out the pods on the left, salvage the Reaper Tech (+3125 credits). Keep moving forward, taking out pods. You will find another Firestorm next to a dead krogan. Jump across the chasm, take out some more pods, and further up the hill, next to another dead scout you will find Ariake Technologies Shoulder Guard right after a conversation about how the Reapers are breeding an army of rachni down here.
Climb up a series of ledges taking out the gestation pods as you go. Jump across a second gap and head down to where you will see Aralakh company on the other side of a chasm holding off Reaper forces. If Grunt is leading the company, there will be an optional view prompt that lets you see Grunt break cover to lift and throw a Ravager while shouting his trademark battlecry. Don't let the Aralakh commander talk you into rushing forward too quickly though, as it's easy to blunder into the gestation pods ahead and there is no actual urgency. Take out the gestation pods and the webbing and then destroy the Reaper Node. Grunt/Dagg will come through and tell you that the rachni have backed off, but will be coming back. He will defend this position so that you can ""finish this."" Make sure to pick up the med kit and the Pistol Piercing Mod before leaving the room. You can also swap out your Firestorm.
Locate Central Chamber[]
The heart of the Reaper infestation, with one Rachni Queen to boot
In the next room, behind the clutch of gestation pods is more Reaper Tech to be salvaged (+3125 credits). Examine the narrow passage to crawl through it.
Reaper fortifications will then extend upward out of the ground and encase you on the walkway. To bypass the walls, you must disable a Reaper node that's above eye level and to the left of the forward fortification.
The left wall will retract once disabled, so be prepared to fight the waiting Reaper forces. Once they have been defeated, proceed toward their position and disable a second Reaper Node, which will retract barriers behind you. Now turn back toward your original position and exterminate a second wave of Reaper forces. When they are down, return to your original position (but before you climb up there you can shoot the fourth and final Barrier Engine up ahead on the left if you spot it) and take cover again, because from beyond it yet another wave of Reaper forces will appear. Now you can destroy the third Reaper Node, but be ready because you will have to fight against one last (and even larger) wave of Reaper forces. When those have finally been defeated, a cutscene will commence.
A swarm of monsters in the final chamber
Combat Tips: The second and third nodes are heavily defended by a mixture of Husks, Cannibals and Ravagers. Since the Ravagers will force you to stay in cover, the principal danger consists of being driven out of cover by Husks or grenades from Cannibals. Husks you can at least keep track of and if a squadmate has some grenades they can be disposed of instantly, sometimes in groups of 2 or 3, whereas grenades from Cannibals can show up any time from many directions: nailing as many Cannibals as possible early in the combat therefore becomes a strong survival consideration.
New enemies will spawn in the center area once each node is destroyed, apparently assuming the player is standing near the node in order to accomplish this. It is possible to use a grenade to destroy a node from a distance but this may result in the player being suddenly surrounded by newly spawned enemies. If for any reason one or both squad members do not follow the player closely to a node, they may be trapped in the open area and quickly knocked out.
Rachni Queen[]
The mother of a thousand young
If you saved the rachni queen in Mass Effect, you will speak to her during this cutscene. If not, you will converse with the Breeder, a different rachni individual who was revived by the Reapers and has become indoctrinated. Either way, you may choose to either leave her or help her to survive (note that your decision will not affect the Reapers' supply of Ravagers one way or another).
If you leave the rachni to die, you will gain Aralakh Company as a war asset worth 25 points, but no rachni assets.
If you choose to rescue the original queen from Noveria, Aralakh Company will suffer grievous losses in the holding action, reducing their strength by 25 points. However, the queen provides rachni workers worth 100 points.
If you choose to rescue the new Breeder, you gain the Aralakh Company and 100 points of rachni workers; however, the Breeder proves untrustworthy after Priority: Horizon, taking away her war asset and removing 100 points from the Alliance Engineering Corps.
No matter what you chose with the rachni queen, Grunt or Urdnot Dagg will stay behind to hold off Ravagers while Shepard's party runs for the shuttle. Dagg will not survive this.
Grunt will only die defending your escape if he was disloyal in the previous game. (He will mention his outsider status in his dialogue outside the falling prefab in this case.) If you completed Grunt's loyalty mission in the previous game, he will survive.
Grunt adds 25 points to Aralakh Company's war asset as its leader if he survives the mission and an additional 25 points as representative of Clan Urdnot should you have earned his loyalty. Additionally, he will himself be added as an independent war asset worth 25 points. You gain 12,500 credits from the Alliance after returning to the Normandy.
Legendary Edition: Should you rescue either the queen or the Breeder, Aralakh Company will not be acquired at all, regardless of Grunt's status."

Afterward, the skycar returns to one of the docking bays to drop you and Bray off. Aria leaves the coordinates of her fleet to Bray for when you're ready to do this war.

Special OpsFrom: Steven Hackett
Shepard: 

Alliance forces are stretched thin across the galaxy. We need your specific talents for a series of ops.

These missions will open doors for the Alliance in places we can’t touch through conventional means. We’ll deploy operatives to hold point after you’ve completed your objectives.

I need you to head to a Cerberus lab on the planet Sanctum. I’ll brief you when you’re inbound.

Hackett","First Artifact[]
First of two artifacts
At the beginning of the mission, go left up the stairs and through the doors. Expect resistance at the top. To get to each artifact you will need to deactivate the containment. After locating the artifact, eliminate the Cerberus troops and collect the artifact, then return to the landing pad and place the artifact onto the shuttle for extraction, but look around for useful items first.
From the initial landing pad and up the ramps, you'll find the Sniper Rifle Enhanced Scope just inside the first archway on the left on the floor. Directly to the right on the console are credits (3,000). Ahead in the room in the hall on the left is a medical station (150 experience). In the corner of the room is a journal entry (18 experience). In the hallway on the right there are more credits (4,000) to the left of the ammo pile. Down the hallway past the reaper artifact (not down the stairs on the left or the right) is a small room with a failed medi-gel experiment. Exit the room and go left down the stairs, pick up the credits (3,000) across from the open doorway. Go down the stairs and in the corner is a journal entry (18 experience).
Second Artifact[]
Second of two artifacts
Go back into the base to locate the next artifact: there will now be more Cerberus troops, this time with turrets. You'll find the second artifact on the lowest level. Once you locate it, be careful as you deactivate its containment because two Cerberus troopers will drop in right near you during the process. Remember to pick up the artifact itself once you've dealt with the new arrivals. Shepard will now radio Cortez who turns out to have been driven away from the landing pad by Cerberus fire.
Exfiltration[]
You must now hold out against an unlimited stream of Cerberus troops until Cortez is able to return. Several radio conversations along the way will provide checkpoints to let you know you're making progress. When Shepard says to just ""reload and keep firing"", do exactly that. After you down more enemies, Shepard will suggest keeping the landing pad clear. You should now return to the room where the shuttle originally dropped out, as this will speed the activation of the next segment. In the third radio check-in, Cortez will say it will just be a bit longer - at this point you should continue to clear the landing pad, but if the firefight gets too hot and you need to pull back there is no penalty.
Finally, you'll see the shuttle pull up and Cortez will tell you to get on. From this point forward, successfully reaching and activating the shuttle will instantly end the mission with victory, regardless of the number of enemies remaining. You may find, however, that you need to clear more enemies away in order to reach the shuttle safely, and there is no pressure preventing you from doing so.
Completion of this mission gives you +5 Reputation, 10,000 credits, and the Cerberus Research Data War Asset."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel_Archives:_Escape,"Prerequisite: Citadel: Identity Theft II
This mission's journal entry is acquired after the cutscenes following the first conflict in the archives.","As the trio of skycars rocket towards the archives, Shepard asks for the best way in. Brooks says that they are below the wards and suggests a direct breach for maximum surprise. Shepard agrees. As they land over the archives, Brooks mentions that it might be hard to get in. James however says that wouldn’t be a problem and pulls out a bomb. If Wrex is around, after the blast he rushes in first then everyone else follows.
Don't get caught napping while waiting for the cutscene to end
After breaching a room, targeting lasers come in from all over, and everyone dives for cover. This is a fight that clearly CAT6 was unprepared for, and everyone starts shooting.
On the ground there are 2 CAT6 Specialists and a CAT6 Sniper, and on the square room's second level there are 2 other Snipers. Focus on the enemies on the ground as the ones upstairs can be taken care of by everyone else. Your ground team consists of the people you picked at the squad selection screen while the rest hangs out in the higher ground. Once the room is clear, a shadowy form appears on the catwalk holding Brooks hostage; an oddly familiar voice orders you and your allies to lay down your weapons.
A Familiar Face[]
The mysterious figure finally steps into the light and, to your surprise, it's... you. More precisely, it's a clone of Commander Shepard that Cerberus grew during the Lazarus Project in case the real Shepard needed a new arm, heart, lung, or spare parts. However, the Illusive Man abandoned the project once he had the real Shepard. The clone remained in a coma until six months ago, right when Shepard was arrested. During those months, the clone learned to be human through the use of neural implants. During the conversation, you can advise the clone that it should be on the same side with you, or you can threaten it. Either way, the clone rejects your words, as it believes itself to be superior to you.
When the dust has settled...
The clone then proceeds to go on and eventually says that people will believe that it is the real Shepard if it's the one flying the Normandy. Shepard calls the ship to lock it down, but the comm is blocked. Instead, the clone calls Traynor to prep for emergency departure, using the codes Shepard just tried to use. It then orders its goons to execute the real Shepard and friends.
There is a quick Renegade interrupt which will result in Shepard shooting the Citadel model above to bring it crashing down on the two troopers on the ground floor. It's okay if you miss it, because another one of your squadmates will do it for you. Everyone springs for cover; now fight your way out.
Avoid becoming overconfident, even if your allies on the catwalks are transforming the area into a shooting gallery. During the battle, your enemies start realizing who they're messing with, helped out by your crew continuing to taunt them while bantering amongst each other. If your love interest is present, they can also be heard vouching for the superiority of your appearance over that of your clone.
Stay under cover; CAT6 is unleashing their full arsenal, so you'll need to be constantly on the move. The group of adversaries you encounter here is known as the Rapier Squad, a name that becomes insignificant once you've bested them in combat. Stay focused, use powers, weapons, and anything to help. Get out of the middle as soon as you can do so safely, as your initial position can be flanked easily. Try and move to a corner and use it to prevent flanks and get the drop on enemies. Generally sticking to the outer rim is a good way to go.
This is your first encounter with CAT6 Heavies: they're basically an ""all armor"" version of the Cerberus Guardian and thus immune to most crowd control and powers that strike their riot shields. They can be flanked or shot in the ""mail slot"" of the shields; if you have an armor-penetrating weapon that also helps. Energy Drain, Overload, Sabotage, and Pull can totally remove their shields; other biotic powers such as Shockwave and Throw can briefly dislodge their shields, but this is less effective. Grenades can damage them if thrown so that they detonate behind their shields. Heavies possess powerful M-76 Revenant rifles and are deadly especially at close range where they can stun you by slamming their shields on the ground, so keep your distance.
Locate Target[]
Once every enemy falls, move to the doors as Shepard orders the teams to stick together and move up. Before leaving, grab the Shotgun Ultralight Materials mod and the medi-gel on the right. Go through the door and, at the top of the ramp behind the desk in front of you is a terminal with 3,750 credits, and on a terminal before the scanning field checkpoints there sits some grenades.
In the next room, a computer voice will tell you that you need Council permission to be in here, well you forgot to get that, so just move on. Beyond the scanners is another med kit, clips, and an SMG Power Magnifier. You now move into what is clearly the main storage area of the archives. The banter of the entire group is humorous but you need to keep moving. Shepard eventually calls Glyph, and after persuading it, it moves off to track the clone.
Find A Way Around[]
When equipment presents itself, what follows should go without saying
At the other end of the catwalks, CAT6 soldiers descend and find out that you are still alive. Your clone comes on the radio to say it needs more time to access the vault. Kill the two soldiers, and then step onto the platform, you are then lowered. Then step into the vault and you are transported deeper into the archives.
In one of the display bins within this transport vault is an M-7 Lancer assault rifle. This rifle does not use clips, but rather a cooldown system from the original game. It was apparently from the First Contact War, and now it may see use again. Note:  taking this weapon is the last opportunity to reselect your weaponry (though not mods) for the rest of this mission; make use of it as you will.
Target Found[]
The vault opens into the next area and then you have to keep moving. Head up and to the right. You'll be crawling over a series of tubes, which fortunately have numerous cover emplacements; more humorous banter follows and then more enemies. Apparently your clone still needs more time - it sends Dagger Squad after you. Not as efficient as the real thing apparently.
This is a claustrophobic warzone, your enemies have as much cover as you and they'll be deploying smoke and cluster grenades every now and then to further restrict visibility or your movements. Kill the CAT6 Snipers and Specialists, you should be able to deal with them all from where you are initially posted so just keep in cover and you should make short work of them.
More enemies will come up and now you will need to move. Keep to cover and move as the situation develops, using the tubes and the catwalks to flank as necessary. Note that there are two parallel tubes along the length of this space, so you may find your enemies alongside you. There is a med kit sitting on crates on a catwalk near the end.
Defend Team Mako[]
A bunch of Snipers and Specialists will hamper your destination: left of the furthest point
Once you move out of that area, you will get a message that Team Mako is pinned down to the left. Brooks repeatedly comms you about it if you dally around, so get going. You'll find Team Mako surrounded by enemies. You can take them out from above if you wish, but this is entirely optional: if you simply jump off the ledge the next cutscene will play.
Shepard sees a CAT6 Sniper moving to flank Team Mako and pops a few bullets her way. The Spectre runs down and covers the squad’s retreat up a ladder. Once everyone else is up, Shepard begins to radio for assistance. The rest of the team, now on the upper catwalk, opens fire, ripping the enemies to shreds. Shepard then climbs the ladder, notes that the clone can't be far, and reminds everyone of the gameplan: keep up the pressure and try to flank the enemy.
Locate Target (again)[]
You're now at the part of the archives housing holographic records of important past events. You will encounter many such holos in your search for the clone, and if you want to check them out, open your ears and listen carefully. They don't have subtitles even with the option turned on.
Some of them will drop in from above
Once you're in control again, the first holo you'll see is a video clip of a turian interrogation from the First Contact War. To resume your hunt, head to the door on your right and follow the catwalks. Apparently, the section of the archive you're in is labeled 3 AR 028. There is another video clip on the left where a krogan is demanding more territory, sparking the Krogan Rebellions. Opposite it is a malfunctioning holo room, there's nothing there except a voice repeating ""malfunction detected"" while you're in the place.
The hallway between those two areas has least one CAT6 Specialist running at you from the far end; should take you less than 3 seconds to kill him. He comes from a spacious office area, which means plenty of cover and obstacles for either you or your enemy depending on how you play it, and there will be plenty of his ilk there. The area also features gaping chasms overlooking the levels below and just separated by low guide rails, allowing for physics-based strategies in merc disposal.
Go ahead and do not turn to your right because you will be flanked instantly. Your shipmates are at the catwalks overhead for fire support but CAT6 Snipers drop in from across them. Keep an eye on all of your flanks and keep enemies away from them because you will be flanked quickly. You are going to have to keep moving here to get the best cover and to keep enemies on your front or their flanks. During the fight there will be more banter amongst the team for some funny business, ending with Shepard asking if all of the comedians can actually start hitting something.
Once the place is clear, there is another historical vid on the left side walls, dealing with the Citadel ban on artificial intelligence. The one next to it is not malfunctioning but is empty; ignore it. Shepard orders the other teams to keep pushing up. Watch the vid, grab ammo, and if you're sure you're done with the area head through the door at the end to continue - it locks after you pass through.
Much of the mission has this type of layout; people who like making enemies fly will enjoy it here
Moving through the next area, watch your left and front as two Specialists will attempt to ambush you. Once they are down, grab the medi-gel in one of the vid areas. The active one is about the geth attack on the Citadel 3 years prior, but because of your Spectre clearance you get the uncensored version that reveals Sovereign's involvement. If Kaidan Alenko or Ashley Williams are in the squad their Spectre status will also be noted by the archive.
Proceeding further, you come across another area with an office-and-chasms setup, only with a more claustrophobic feel due to man-height crates scattered about and handy for cover. You're actually at the level below the first office-and-chasms room, and Teams Mako and Hammerhead also moved there to once more provide support from above. As the next fight starts, even Glyph gets into the action with the humorous banter. There are only a few enemies, but one CAT6 Heavy is on your left so watch the crossfire and stick behind the wall so he can’t flank you.
Once the fight is over, Glyph comes to you saying it has found 18 previously unknown historical events. Shepard asks about the target, and Glyph says that the clone ordered it away. Shepard sends Glyph back after it. There is a terminal with 3750 credits nearby (if you stand with your back to the small 'window' through which light is coming, it is ahead and to your left) and a Sniper Rifle High-Velocity Barrel mod on the far right hand side of the room. Head over to where Glyph is hovering and proceed through the door. After the second door, there is a med kit hidden between some boxes on the left. Grab it and proceed when ready through the third door, which will lock after you pass through.
Target Found[]
It only looks fearsome at first glance
The area after that is another section of the archives with mountains of storage tubes. It yields more banter, and a brief HUD update tells you that the target is found, but an Atlas Mech is in your way. Perched on the upper level, it decides that it is too much to face Team Mako, so it drops to your level once you start hitting it. Now it is your problem. Luckily there are no other enemies and you have plenty of cover there so just focus on it and it will explode fast. It isn’t worth trying to hijack as it couldn't go anywhere even if you did (killing the pilot results in the Atlas exploding anyway).
Alternatively, merely running past the area before the Atlas drops (it drops if Shepard damages it in any way) will draw a sarcastic response from one of the members of the support teams: Garrus, Tali, Wrex, or a frightened response from Brooks. If you continue to run past it, when you're halfway down the catwalk the mech explodes courtesy of Team Mako.
No matter how you deal with the Atlas, you can check the area to the right of the door you entered for an ammo resupply as well as a med kit at the base of the ramp. Glyph returns to warn of a new opponent ahead: ""Razor Squad"", that wishes to do ""bodily harm."" Also, there is an elcor mating-totem Glyph found to be interesting. Focus on causing bodily harm to Razor and ignore the totem for now. The catwalk ends in a drop rendering you unable to backtrack so proceed at your own discretion.
Razor Squad[]
Dangerous even without omni-shields
You're now at a very spacious area with options for catwalk flanking or ground-level skirmishing. Mako and Hammerhead trashtalk each other as they flank the opposition. Glyph tries to get the mercs to stop, only to be shot at. You can use the elevated catwalk here to your advantage, but watch for snipers when heading up the ladder. Enemies are quite easy to eliminate here once you're securely positioned in cover. Try to eliminate the snipers first if possible so that they'll be out of the picture before the next wave of enemies arrives.
Caution: Enemies including Heavies can climb up the ladders as well and sometimes do so to reach you.
Once the initial group is almost dead, ""Razor Squad"" consisting of four Heavies arrives via a rising platform. Keep your distance and watch for their guns as they can rip you apart very quickly. Move your squadmates to flank them, then light them up, using powers that remove their shields and weaken their armor to leave them more vulnerable. Because you will still likely have enemies from the initial group present, be sure to keep an eye on them as well. If you're finding yourself overwhelmed you can always retreat, even as far back as the catwalk where you came from; the last viable cover available is near there.
Once you are done grab the med kit on the boxes to the left and head through the door.
Eliminate Target[]
Someone's been pilfering Earth's treasures...
In next area, everything suddenly gets quiet. This section of the archives is apparently labeled 5 AR 037. Move along the path until you enter a large room and take cover. There are only two enemies to deal with at this point, so they aren’t a problem. Glyph also has a message from your clone, though not exactly a good one.
Once you have dealt with the two enemies, look around for a terminal on the right side with 3750 credits. Further down you will find a Sniper Rifle Ultralight Materials mod in the middle and an Assault Rifle Ultralight Materials mod on the left. There is a terminal with 3750 credits at the far end just past where the mods are located. The vids are again free to peruse: one deals with the original release of the genophage, another is about the founding of the Spectres, and yet another is a damaged holo of an ""early religious artifact"" from Earth. There is a medical station in the vid corridor, close to the genophage vid. If you linger in the area, Glyph will note that the ""other"" Commander has a ""bad temper"" and doesn't mind collateral damage. Glyph also laments the deaths of the archives' scientists as it wished to discuss the elcor mating-totem with them. When you are ready, head through the door where the opposition came out and up the stairs.
Snuff 'em before they smoke up the place
Shepard tries to radio Team Hammerhead and the radio is once again jammed. When you emerge, at the area above the previous level, team Mako is ahead and moves to make a path. You have to deal with two Heavies and from where you're initially at there's a lot of walls, desks, and covered railings to lean out of. Once they are dealt with, advance and take out the three snipers to your right. They like to hang out near the railing-guarded hole; good opportunity once more for ragdolling blasts. When you are done, head through another door and up the stairs, but do not miss out on the vid showing the first discovery of the Citadel by the asari. Shepard tries to raise Mako and Brooks starts saying they are under attack, but can’t complete before being cut off.
Advance a little further and Brooks confirms that the clone is indeed jamming the radios. She says the rest have gone ahead to cut the clone off, but she has been hit again and needs help. Feel free to peruse the vid, which deals with the deliberations behind Shepard’s Spectre status; there are no enemies around, so take your time. Head through the hallway and down the corridor. It takes a quick bioscan to confirm your identity, and then you get in.
I Should Go[]
There's a reason the vault light was colored red
As you step in head forward towards Brooks, but as you cross the plane, the vault's shields activate and seal you and your companions in. Shepard calls for assistance, but the clone makes an appearance. The clone says your companions are trapped in the iridium vaults, and then introduces Brooks, who in fact doesn’t work for the Alliance. Turns out Brooks isn’t even her name. She is ex-Cerberus, the one who put together all of those dossiers a year ago for the Suicide Mission, but became disillusioned that Cerberus was looking to aliens for help, leaving as the Illusive Man descended into madness. She goes on to give what really happened at the sushi restaurant and at the party, while further revealing that she's the one who activated Shepard's clone six months ago.
Depending on your choice of dialogue, two Paragon or two Renegade interrupts allow you to threaten the two villains. In any case, neither Brooks nor the clone take you seriously. The clone uses the archives to update the handprint records, which can’t be accurately cloned, and then seals Shepard and the squad into the vault. The clone then departs for the Normandy, but not before taunting you with a familiar phrase: ""I should go.""
Despite being sealed in the vault, Shepard appears more concerned about the way they have always said ""I should go"" and asks if they really sound like that. One of the squadmates will confirm it. You can take the conversation where you want, but eventually one of your squadmates asks why Shepard isn’t more worried about their current situation, at which point Shepard calls Glyph to get them out."

Missions

Mahavid: Leviathan"
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Priority:_Tuchanka,"Prerequisite: Priority: Sur'Kesh
Prerequisite: Attican Traverse: Krogan Team or Tuchanka: Turian Platoon
This mission is automatically acquired after Eve's retrieval from Sur'Kesh. However, actually finishing this mission requires completing either mission given by the turian and krogan leaders aboard the Normandy. The journal text updates to the following entry upon fulfillment of the condition:
“The genophage cure is a success, but it must be synthesized and dispersed across all of Tuchanka using the Shroud tower. Land on Tuchanka and get Eve safely to the tower.”
The NavPoint for this mission is now available on Tuchanka. Upon landing on the planet, the final journal update is shown:
“The plan to disperse the genophage cure has been complicated by the arrival of Reaper forces, who have occupied the area near the shroud tower. Get Eve safely to the tower.”","Prologue[]
To complete the treaty between the krogan and the turians, the Clan Urdnot leader (Wrex / Wreav) insists that the genophage must be cured. Mordin Solus / Padok Wiks needs time to stabilize Eve and prepare the cure — at minimum, either Tuchanka: Turian Platoon OR Attican Traverse: Krogan Team must be finished before Eve is declared ready for transport to Tuchanka. This is a good time to finish the time-sensitive missions mentioned above.
The genophage cure is to be dispersed from the top of the Shroud, a tower constructed by the salarians to stabilize the atmosphere of Tuchanka, and later covertly used by the turians to disperse the original genophage virus. The salarian STG member that prepared the cure will travel to the Shroud with Eve and ensure that this takes place.
Travel to the planet Tuchanka in the Krogan DMZ and select the proper NavPoint. In the cutscene, you discover that the Reapers are using the Shroud to poison Tuchanka's atmosphere. It is impossible to land the shuttle at the Shroud site due to the presence of a Reaper Destroyer there.
It is decided that the krogan will attack the Reaper from the ground while turian fighters fly air support. The salarian Dalatrass then privately contacts Shepard and reveals that the Shroud was sabotaged to prevent dispersal of a cure. She suggests tricking the krogan into thinking that the cure has been deployed, and offers salarian support for the war effort if Shepard does so.
Defend Eve[]
Wreav
Shepard will then take a shuttle down to the surface. The Urdnot leader sent word for the krogan clans to assemble at the Hollows, a sacred krogan meeting ground. During the conversation, you can reveal the Dalatrass's offer to sabotage the cure or just remain silent. If you choose to reveal, you will be interrupted by a message that the Hollows are under Reaper attack.
When you reach the Hollows, you need to fight off waves of Husks swarming the area. It's an arena-type pit with wide berth to run around in circles even with husks appearing from all directions, so putting them down should be easy enough. You will gain 300 experience points after successfully holding off the Husks. In the ensuing scenes, if Wrex is alive, tensions mount between him and his brother Wreav, who is one of his most disloyal supporters; if Wreav leads, Jorgal Thurak takes his place. Eve intervenes during the rising conflict and makes a rallying call for the krogan to unite against the Reapers.
The Convoy[]
The krogan head out in a convoy towards the Shroud. While travelling, you're given the option again to reveal the Dalatrass's deal or keep quiet about it. Soon after, the convoy comes to an immediate halt, and the team dismounts to find out why.
If you see the Graal, you have good eyesight
Running around is recommended, as the area is a treasure trove of loot. You can pick up a Shotgun Smart Choke upgrade, a Death Mask helmet, a Pistol Melee Stunner, a Pistol Magazine Upgrade, the Graal Spike Thrower shotgun, and 2 Med-kits around. A couple of krogan interactions are optional: you can speak to one fixing and complaining about a tomkah's combustion manifold, and there's another who was the owner of the Graal you took and wants whatever you kill with it as his ""trophies"". To kick off the next part of the plot, however, speak to the Krogan Scout, who tells you that the road is damaged and the convoy can't proceed further.
However, the turian air support has already begun their attack, and are too close to call it off. A fighter is shot down by the Reaper and hits a truck. Shepard radios the Urdnot leader to get out of the area. However, you and the squad are left behind and have to find an alternative route. At this point, you gain another 150 experience.
The only path left is through the ruins. Jump over a gap and head into the tunnel.
Escape the Catacombs[]
You're now in an ancient krogan city which has been abandoned for millennia. There are no enemy encounters here. Go down the stairs into the first room, and either jump through the gap off the ledge on your left, or go down the next set of stairs to your right. In the second room, there is a door to your right and to your left. Go through the door on the left, and on the right-hand wall of that room is an Ancient Krogan Artifact, a painting that can be salvaged for 8,500 credits.
Return to the door on the right, go down the stairs. Right before another jump down, Shepard and the team experience strong tremors. The Urdnot leader radios that they're not experiencing similar readings on the surface. Eve suggests that it could be something else, warning that Kalros, the mother of all thresher maws, is said to live in the region.
Your squadmates will make various comments upon investigating the artifacts and paintings in this area. These comments may interrupt your radio conversations with the Urdnot leader and Eve, but Shepard will apologize and request that they repeat themselves so the radio conversations aren't missed.
The third krogan cave painting
Jump down the ledge at the end of the path and turn to the left. In the far end of this area, you can salvage another Ancient Krogan Artifact on the wall for 8,250 credits – a striking depiction of a thresher maw. After retrieving it, go to the other side of the room and turn left into a tunnel, where you'll find the final Ancient Krogan Artifact, another painting, worth 8,250 credits on the right. Further along the path, you will examine an insect-like corpse – depending on whether you've gone to Utukku first or not, you may or may not immediately realize the importance of the find.
With the realization in mind, head up the stairs into the light. You will gain another 300 experience after exiting the catacombs. Take the time to enjoy the surroundings, a lot of brown mixed with a surprising amount of green, and you and your team will discuss amongst yourselves the lamentable destruction of old krogan civilization.
As you move forward, you will face a wave of Cannibals and Ravagers. Then when you move forward again, a second set will drop from the sky. The ruins provide lots of cover, but this can work both ways, so take care to park your squadmates behind cover to prevent their AI from stupidly charging forward and getting themselves killed. Ravagers here provide most of the heavy suppression fire; one tactic is for you to flank the enemy using the tunnel to the left while keeping your squadmates within the enemy's sight but safely covered.
Once the area is clear, move ahead and turn right to jump over the gap. A wave of Cannibals will appear followed by some more coming around the corner, and finally a Brute or two accompanied by some Husks. The second wave is triggered by leaping over the gap. None of the enemies can follow you if you retreat back over the gap after triggering the wave, allowing you to kill them without risking direct combat. A less cheesy way of killing them would be to hunker down on the two conveniently placed debris-for-cover and power- and/or weapon-spamming. After the battle, if you delay overlong the Urdnot leader and the scientist salarian will comically harangue you over comms.
Tuchanka's ruins and remaining plant life
After the second wave, go forward, around the U-turn, and up the ledges on the left. At the same time, the krogan will be talking over the radio about a plan to hunt Kalros, but Eve will say that the Commander has enough to worry about.
This is your cue to get into cover, as a third wave of Cannibals, Husks, and Ravagers will attack. You have an elevated and covered platform from which to dispense fire and steel, just be wary of Husks spawning from the left and running up your stairs. Alternately, a circular rock big enough for all of your team for crouching cover is also available.
Once they are dead, head for the right side of the open area and toward the krogan statues.
Upon reaching the second bridge, Kalros appears and chases the convoy, damaging the bridge in the process. Jump over the gap and go to a memorial area further up. Loitering in the promontory overlooking desolate wastelands after the gap before proceeding to the statues will elicit some remarks from your squad. As you approach the small bridge, a wave of Cannibals and Husks will attack. Remember that sending them off the edge of the platforms will result in instant deaths.
After some more dialogue with the convoy, more Husks will attack along with some Marauders. Once they are dead, you will find an SMG Scope upgrade on the left side of this area. Head down and back up the two short sets of stairs where the Marauders came from and find an Assault Rifle Extended Barrel upgrade on the left.
Turn right and drop down off the edge of a series of ledges toward the dunes to trigger a cutscene. Shepard and team board the Urdnot leader's ride, but the second truck carrying Wreav/Thurak is pulled into the ground by Kalros.
The Maw Hammers[]
Reaper and the Shroud
Eve suggests using the ancient Maw Hammers to summon Kalros to the area and distract the Reaper away from the Shroud. Shepard agrees and heads out to activate the maw hammers, while your salarian scientist heads out in another direction to finalize a cure to the Genophage. The Urdnot leader stays behind to take care of the incoming rachni horde.
Clear out the two sets of Cannibals immediately following the cutscene. While you're busy, the Urdnot leader radios in to say he's taken care of things on his end, but since you're busy, he volunteers to raise the Hammers while you still must push onward to activate them yourself. When you're done go up the flight of stairs. At the top of the stairs, pick up the M-5 Phalanx Heavy Pistol.
When you attempt to cross the bridge nearby, the Reaper blasts the bridge and Shepard falls down below. As its most immediate threat, the Reaper targets you and begins firing its laser. Take cover frequently, and move up between the shots. Alternatively, because the blasts will be aimed at the structures covering you, it is easy to just sprint into the next area. Once you reach the cover spot in the middle, the turian fighters will appear again in the nick of time to draw the Reaper's fire.
To reach the Maw Hammer controls, you must fight through a gauntlet of Brutes, while avoiding getting crushed by the Reaper. The Brutes spawn continuously by dropping down from the Reaper until both Maw Hammers have been activated, so don't try to fight them all to the death (because it very well could be yours). Instead, the favored approach is to simply dash through the battlefield, activating the Maw Hammers without delay.
The Reaper's legs are a major threat: one direct hit will drop your shields at the very least; if the Reaper lands a second hit before your shields regenerate, it's an instant kill. Thankfully, many of the leg stabs are focused on the two catwalks leading to the maw hammers, and it's fairly easy to anticipate them thanks to the shadow that looms on the ground. Spawning Brutes can be even nastier, as there is no warning and a chance that they can drop in right on top of you, dealing heavy damage and blocking your movement, to say nothing of being in immediate proximity to a Brute.
Additional Tips:
After the initial Brutes spawn in the central area, in general the best plan is to dash past them (bait out their forward lunge first to make this easier) and head to the Maw Hammer on the right first. Going to the right first seems to have the lowest chance of Brutes spawning right on top of you.
Your squadmates are expendable distractions here—if they survive and gun down Brutes, great, if they go down, you can revive them with First Aid to get them back up for distraction purposes. As for you, only worry about killing Brutes if you have to clear a safe path, otherwise plan to simply dash or roll past them on your way to the Maw Hammers. Killing Brutes simply means more will be raining down on you, so really it has the potential to hurt you even more than it helps.
If you have Defense Matrix as your bonus ability and keep it active, it will make this section much easier: any time a leg (or a Brute) hits you and knocks your shield down, purge Defense Matrix immediately and your shield will be instantly restored. This will enable you to survive a second leg strike, thus making dashing through the battlefield to the Maw Hammers a far safer prospect. Obviously, put Defense Matrix back up as soon as it recharges.
A direct hit from a leg deals 1200 damage and ignores shield gates. Having at least 1 point in Fitness will ensure that Shepard (at full health and shields) survives a hit. Otherwise the legs can kill the player in one hit.
If you are playing a Vanguard, target Brutes with Biotic Charge and immediately roll out of the way of their retaliatory lunge to cover ground more quickly.
An Infiltrator can cloak and use the invisibility to prevent Brutes from attacking you as you run past.
Soldiers should use Adrenaline Rush to take advantage of the time slowdown while running the gauntlet.
When both hammers have been activated, their combined worth successfully attracts Kalros. In stunning fashion, Kalros bests the Reaper, dragging it beneath the surface of Tuchanka's wasteland.
The Shroud[]
The Shroud dispersing particles into Tuchanka's atmosphere as krogan look on
With all opposition from the Reapers destroyed, Shepard and the salarian doctor approach the Shroud, their associates having been told to retreat to safety. However, the Shroud sustained damage in the fight against the Reaper – it is falling to pieces as Shepard approaches. Within, Eve's STG caretaker – Mordin Solus or Padok Wiks – is attempting to stabilize the structure. He will also report on Eve's status; in the absence of Maelon's data, she will have died whilst Shepard handled the Reaper.
All outcomes are available regardless of whether Mordin or Wiks is present, so for convenience we will refer to the character as ""Mordin"".
At this point, Shepard may either let Mordin go or stop him to sabotage the cure per the Dalatrass's request. There are multiple outcomes to this conversation:
If Shepard warned of the Dalatrass's deal in the convoy, Mordin deploys the counter-sabotage and deploys the cure, sacrificing his life in the process. This is the only outcome in this situation. You may use a Paragon interrupt just before Mordin steps into the elevator to get some morality points, but it won't change Mordin's fate.
If Shepard did not reveal the sabotage while in the convoy to the Shroud, Mordin will realize something is wrong. Either Shepard tells Mordin about the Dalatrass's deal, or Mordin will correctly surmise it. If Shepard tries to sabotage the cure, and Wrex and/or Eve are alive, Mordin will refuse to listen. Shepard is offered a Renegade interrupt to gun him down. If Shepard does not take it, Mordin will deploy the counter-sabotage and successfully cure the Genophage but die in the explosion that follows; otherwise, the sabotage is left intact, and the cure fails.
If Shepard has not revealed the sabotage and tries to make Mordin abandon the mission while Wrex and Eve are both dead, persuade options can be used on Mordin to convince him that it is for the best if the Shroud remain sabotaged and the krogan fooled into believing the genophage cured. This is the only scenario where Mordin lives. Both Mordin and Wiks agree to fake their own deaths, but Mordin becomes a War Asset at the Crucible project, whereas Wiks, according to an e-mail he sends you after the mission, instead seeks out a quiet colony world where he will work as a farmer and take his secret to the grave."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Party,"Prerequisite: Citadel Docks: Retake the Normandy
Joker suggests throwing a party at the Personal Apartment immediately after the attempted hijacking of the Normandy SR-2.","Choose a party theme[]
Better bring out the insurance papers if you invited these guys
When the invites go out, Glyph will ask the Commander what type of party should be held: Quiet or Energetic. These choices will affect the initial dialogue in the first part of the party but not the group arrangements which are determined by the guest list.
Liara and Traynor will be standing in the kitchen, joined by Tali, Samara, and Garrus. EDI and Joker will be at the bar near the window, joined by Miranda and Jacob. James and Cortez will be sitting on the couches near the piano, joined by Ashley/Kaidan and Jack.
If both Wrex and Grunt are invited they will stand upstairs on the balcony overlooking the lower area, where they will be joined by Zaeed and Javik. Javik is seated in the kitchen and Zaeed will be loitering near the couches' fireplace if one or both krogan are missing, and the lone krogan present will stand near the couches occupied by James and Cortez. Kasumi will flit between the bar group and the kitchen group to uncloak and interject in ongoing conversations.
Second part[]
After speaking to two groups, Shepard can speak to Glyph a second time and either keep the theme going (Keep it relaxed/Let's get louder!) or change to the other (Mellow out/Kick it up!). The second theme can be considered a continuation of the first, but it is in no way dependent on the previous choice. It has the exact same character positions, group arrangements, and resulting dialogue regardless of the first half. Each variant will have some disagreements which Shepard can resolve.
""Tktuh-tktuh-tktuh-tktuh. You have to imagine my arms are the wings.""
In the Quiet Party's second part, different groups will form. Wrex and Grunt will sit on the couches by the piano. Liara and James will sit in the downstairs den comparing the merits of the SSV Normandy and the Normandy SR-2, which Shepard can weigh in on, joined by Tali, Miranda and Jacob. If Tali is there, she will assist by acting out the flight handling and engine noises of both ships.
EDI will stay at the bar by the window, but will be joined by Cortez, along with Javik and Jack. Shepard can choose whether to serve more drinks (by highlighting Cortez) or to serve more snacks (by highlighting EDI).
Traynor and Joker will be in the upstairs lounge, somewhat awkwardly discussing Traynor's comments about the attractiveness of EDI's voice, joined by Ashley or Kaidan. Samara will meditate in the the stone garden by the upstairs lounge. Garrus and Zaeed will stand on the balcony discussing the defensibility of Shepard's apartment.
Kasumi will flit cloaked from place to place, appearing with Tali's group if she's around, and on Joker's group.
In the Energetic Party's second part, Liara and James will be on the balcony, joined by Ashley/Kaidan, Jacob, and Miranda/Jack. They will be arguing about whether biotics or muscle is more powerful, and Shepard chooses which to support. Kasumi uncloaks trying to goad Vega to do sit-ups if Shepard chooses biotics over his muscle. Traynor and EDI will be in the upstairs lounge, extremely awkwardly discussing Traynor's comments about the attractiveness of EDI's voice, joined by Tali.
""You know what this is? It's a man emergency. Take this kid out back and make him do target practice.""
Joker will remain at the bar by the window downstairs, arguing with Cortez and joined by Garrus, Wrex, and Javik/Zaeed. All of them will criticize Joker's refusal to keep a gun in the cockpit for emergencies, and try to convince him to do some target practice later. Shepard may side with Joker or Cortez.
Samara will be meditating under the staircase nearest to the entrance, unless Zaeed is also present, in which case they will be together in the downstairs conference room, admiring the painting, while Zaeed unsuccessfully hits on Samara.
Grunt will be at the door, turning away party crashers on the intercom, and Shepard can either attempt to screen prospective guests (by supporting 'Invite Up'), or take a turn to reject a few (by supporting 'Turn Away'). Either way no new people get in as Shepard gets creeped out by some fans if the Commander tries to be welcoming.
If both Miranda and Jack are present, they will be in the den, bickering and insulting each other. Shepard may either encourage them to reconcile, or encourage further conflict. Kasumi uncloaks at their conversation and adds extra hilarity, regardless of what Shepard decides.
In addition to intruding on conversations, regardless of party setting Kasumi will uncloak in the kitchen, the downstairs bathroom, by the bookshelf in the upstairs lounge, in the balcony near the sculpture, on a seat near the bar, outside next to the door, and on the bed in the upstairs guest bedroom.
Wrap up[]
After talking to Glyph a third time, you can choose to begin the final phase of the party. In this case, the groups and interactions are set by the choice of theme for the second part, and Shepard can only decide which group Glyph will appear with.
In the final part of a Quiet Party, Liara and James will be playing cards in the den, along with Javik and an initially cloaked Kasumi, with Glyph acting as the dealer if sent there by Shepard. Traynor and EDI will either be preparing more food in the kitchen or more drinks in the bar, with Glyph's help if Shepard sends the drone to them. Grunt and Kaidan join them in anticipation of getting whatever is served first. Tali will be sitting in the downstairs bathroom floor, wasted and barely comprehensible.
Good times, yes, but lacking in broken objects and gunfire
Joker and Cortez will be upstairs with Ashley, Jacob, Wrex, Jack, Miranda and Samara. They will be discussing the different Normandy crews, with dialogue varying depending on Shepard's decision in the party's second part. Zaeed will be by the hot tub and Garrus by the door, setting up traps for intruders and coordinating with each other if both are there.
In the final part of the Energetic Party, Liara and James will continue their confrontation on the balcony, along with Miranda, Jacob, and Ashley/Kaidan. Glyph will be there if sent by Shepard to check on them. If Shepard supported Liara, she will lift James off the floor with biotics, while if James was supported, he and Jacob (and Kaidan, if present) will be doing push-ups. Kasumi uncloaks on Vega's back, having sat there for quite a while. After Shepard talks to the group, they will all start dancing, and Kasumi disappears once more. Meanwhile, Grunt is drunk and sitting in the shower in the upstairs washroom and will respond with various incoherent or humorous lines if spoken to.
If Ashley is at the party, and Shepard locked in a different love interest (or expressed interest at one or none of the other nonstandard romances aside from James) at the time of the party, she and James will not dance. Instead, they will go to the upstairs lounge area together and flirt, which Shepard can encourage or discourage. In any other condition, both of them will show off their dance moves along with their groupmates on the balcony.
Downstairs, Traynor and Cortez will dance in the area between the kitchen and conference room, along with Jack, Samara, Garrus and Tali. Glyph will be here if sent by Shepard to set up a dance floor. Kasumi is in the closet of the downstairs bedroom nearby going through Shepard's underwear drawer.
""Dancing during wartime wastes precious energy."" Krogan-style party FTW
Wrex, Zaeed and Javik are by the bar near the window, and they will be setting up a shooting gallery if Shepard supported Cortez. Joker and EDI are at the couch near the piano, where EDI is trying to convince Joker to dance. Joker doesn't want to, and Shepard may side with EDI or Joker in this. Either choice results in Joker dancing even if Shepard lets him do as he wants since EDI serves up more alcohol to get the pilot inebriated anyway.
After speaking to all groups and listening to as much dialogue as you wish, approach the couch to assemble the team for a Group Photo. Romantic couples face each other in the picture (Shepard and love interest, EDI and Joker if Shepard did not dissuade them from pursuing a relationship), otherwise everyone will just look into the camera. This photograph will hereafter be seen hanging near the downstairs bar, on the opposite side of the fireplace.
Aftermath[]
Shepard wakes up, potentially with their love interest in their arms, and assesses the aftermath. If Mordin survived Mass Effect 2 up to the completion of the genophage arc in Mass Effect 3, a datapad containing recordings from him will be available on the floor immediately beside the bed.
It is possible for a female Shepard who is not in a romance (or is locked into a romance with Kelly Chambers) to wake up with either James Vega or Javik, depending on dialogue choices made during the party.
After the party the characters are more spread out, with no groups at all if only the mandatory guests were invited. Javik nurses a hangover by Shepard's hot tub, while Tali is on the bed in the guest bedroom on the same floor, doing the same. Liara is in the upstairs lounge along with Garrus and Glyph. Samara meditates in the same place as in the second part of the Quiet Party: the rock garden near Liara and Garrus. Kasumi is on the balcony.
Eat my eggs
James is cooking breakfast in the kitchen, joined by Miranda, Grunt, and Ashley/Kaidan. Steve is on one of the couches near the piano, along with Zaeed, while EDI is standing beside the piano, looking out the window. Joker is hung-over at the bar by the window, while Wrex is sitting on a couch nearby. Traynor is in the den, hiding from EDI and searching the extranet for embarrassing recordings from the previous night. Jacob is doing sit-ups in the downstairs bedroom while Jack does chin-ups.
Most characters' dialogues are no different regardless of the second theme, while others are more sobered up or hung over.
After exiting the apartment, signal the Rapid Transit beside Armax Arsenal Arena to return everyone to Docking Bay D24, reminding them that the war is still going on. The Normandy crew members gathers at the observation window overlooking the Normandy. If Shepard has a love interest, they share some intimate words; otherwise, it is Joker who reminisces with the Commander. If Shepard romanced Thane, his spirit appears after everyone else but Shepard has boarded the ship, offering words of support for his siha. Shepard enters the Normandy last as the DLC comes to a close.
Note: Although the DLC storyline ends at this point, the Silversun Strip remains accessible. Missed interactions or other Strip activities can still be concluded until the Citadel itself becomes inaccessible."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Arrae:_Ex-Cerberus_Scientists,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II
This mission is acquired from Specialist Traynor after the Cerberus assault on the Citadel. Talk to her to find out about a lead on something she deems interesting.","Landing[]
They'll stand no chance against indoctrinated commandos
The mission begins with a landing on an area that is already under assault by Cerberus forces. If he survived Mass Effect 2, Jacob Taylor will be present and be injured in the firefight; if not, a stand-in character named Dr. Webber will be hit instead. After Shepard clears the initial pad area a conversation ensues. Jacob will vouch for Shepard to the refugee leader, Dr. Brynn Cole, but, in Jacob's absence, Dr. Cole will be mistrustful due to Shepard's past ties with Cerberus, forcing you to engage three more Assault Troopers before she'll let you in.
Inside, you talk to Dr. Cole and Jacob Taylor if he's present and learn more about the situation.  If Jacob is there and Tali or Garrus are in the squad Jacob will greet them as well.  After the conversation ends, you can talk to a grieving doctor nearby for some reputation points. You can then meet Dr. Gavin Archer at the top of the first flight of stairs.  If Overlord was completed in Mass Effect 2, talking with Dr. Archer can lead to gaining him as a War Asset but only in the following scenarios: he is not informed of the fate of the geth (if this is after Priority: Rannoch and his brother David Archer was left with Cerberus), or he is informed about the fate of his brother (if David was rescued from Cerberus both in Mass Effect 2 and at Grissom Academy).  Some morality points can be earned in this conversation as well.  Reminiscently you may notice the Overlord music playing when you fight your way to the satellite tower soon. Meanwhile you will also find a datapad with 2,500 credits, and another datapad with some insight into some of the research being done. Through the door is an Assault Rifle Magazine Upgrade and a Weapon Bench. Up the stairs and through another door is a medical station.
Upon talking to Dr. Cole, Shepard will also be alarmed by the discovery that some of the scientists brought their families with them. Jacob/Dr. Webber will inform Dr. Cole that the installation's roof-mounted anti-aircraft guns are offline. But first things first, take the time to explore Dr. Cole's base.
On the top floor is a datapad, another datapad with 2,500 credits, a microscope that triggers a comment from Shepard about a poison designed for turians, another datapad about the work they were conducting, and a Shotgun High Caliber Barrel mod behind a crate near the door to the next area. You can also talk to Brynn and listen to other conversations happening in the area for some interesting tidbits of information.
In the medbay you can find the Kassa Fabrications Greaves on some crates by the door, a datapad with 1,250 credits, another datapad from Jacob about the AA guns, a medical station on the wall, and you can talk to Jacob if he's present.
Satellite Control Area[]
Even Cerberus ""secret"" bases are impressive in size
Shepard is tasked with restarting the AA emplacements. To do this, you'll first need to restore satellite telemetry, so head out through the door and up the ladder. Be sure to grab the M-6 Carnifex on the pipe to the left. When you come around the corner, there are guards facing the wrong way including a Combat Engineer, but they're standing near a Shield Pylon, so if you want to ambush effectively you'll need to snipe the Pylon (or turn it against the enemy soldiers with Sabotage, which will not alert them), hit both guards with shield draining powers or combos, or just start shooting.  Continue up the raised platform to find another Combat Engineer guarding the satellite control area.
Note: This Combat Engineer sabotaging telemetry controls cannot be damaged by gunfire until he turns around to acknowledge you, but you can use abilities such as Overload to get his attention and even damage him, which allows you to engage him before jumping down from the ramp if you wish.
Reinforcements will jump down to join him, and if you can place a Singularity or other unpleasant surprise like a Sentry Turret under them, you'll win without breaking a sweat. Pick up the SMG High Caliber Barrel behind the crates on the left after the drop down.
Occasionally, Cerberus troops will stay on the roof of the building to the right and fire down from there.  Take them out fast if they do this, as it's difficult to take cover from enemies in that vantage point.
Tip: Note that after eliminating the Cerberus forces but prior to actually activating the button to repair the dish, you can first turn around climb back up onto the next section and destroy all the shield generators and collect any items facing no resistance all the way to the turret, as enemies will not spawn until you actually repair the dish. You can then return to the dish, repair it and the shields you took down will remain down, making the next section considerably easier.
Once you restore the controls, Jacob or Brynn will tell you that the AA guns still need to be activated. Next to the controls, a Med-kit and a Datapad worth 2,500 credits can be found.
Turret and AA Towers[]
Perfect weather for shooting Cerberus
Now you need to return to the main facility to reactivate the AA Towers, but Cerberus forces drop onto the raised platform you just vacated. Clear them out and ascend. In the distance, by the right AA gun, will be a turret manned by an unshielded gunner as well as typical assault forces. The turret gunner can be knocked off his gun by ""bending""  a variety of physics powers (e.g. Throw) around the turret shielding, sniped carefully between the gaps in the shield, or blown away with an explosive projectile from a weapon such as the Venom Shotgun or a squadmate's grenade power (which doesn't need to be thrown). Before climbing the tower, there is a med-kit in the center past the corrugated surface you climb up to in three steps under a curved metal pipe, as well as a Sniper Rifle Piercing Mod that can be found behind the large containers near the ladder to the right tower. This ladder is broken, so make your way up the left tower. Activate the AA gun and move across the crosswalk to the adjoining platform.
On the second AA tower is a Datapad containing 3,750 credits, a Med-kit below the datapad, and down the ladder is a Shotgun Spare Thermal Clip. Climb back up and activate the second AA gun to discover it requires repairs. Assign the squad member of your choice and head quickly to man the turret or you may encounter a bug. On the other AA tower and on the platform below, Cerberus shuttles will deploy troops including three of the highly evasive Phantoms; use the turret to obliterate the opposition, or simply get in cover if you'd prefer to use Shepard's powers against the Phantoms. Shuttles will land a trio of troops at the first AA gun station and down on the roof where you just fought, which is on the gun's left side; said troops descend very slowly, so that's the best time to snipe (or ""turret"") them.  Once all enemies are dead, return to the AA gun console and activate it.
Tip: The turret gun has sufficient penetration that it can shoot through the Cerberus shuttles.  On lower difficulties, you can open fire as the door opens, and kill troops before they have a chance to exit and spread out.
Evacuation[]
Scientists cheering the first shuttle's launch
Back inside the facility, Dr. Cole discusses the situation with you and asks if the scientists should go now or wait. This is not a tactical decision; she is giving you a chance to prep before the final battle. There's really no reason to delay going immediately, as all the doors leading in and out of the room are locked, making it difficult to go back for any loot you forgot. If you choose to delay, this is the last chance to pick up anything you may have missed.
As the evacuation is underway, a Cerberus fighter will suicide into one of the AA guns, breaching the defenses.  Cerberus troops then crash through the skylights, and you will have to fight them upon regaining control. Dispatch the three troops in the upper area and head down to dispatch three more on the stairs leading back to the hangar doors where you first entered the facility.
When the hangar doors open there are several troops to battle.
Warning:  Squadmate AI will often cause your team to back quickly away from the hangar doors looking for cover instead of moving forward into the area with you, so give them specific orders to prevent this. Also, once you move past the doors, they shut behind you, which can trap squadmates there, preventing them from aiding you except with powers, until you move forward far enough that they will ""teleport"" to you, which is dangerous in an active combat zone. Order them to move past the doors before you do.
Once the initial enemies are eliminated, Cerberus shuttles will arrive and drop more troops on the raised platforms on either side. Be sure to disable or Sabotage the generators and their accompanying pylons supplying the enemy with shields. Another Phantom will appear, so stay sharp. Eventually Cerberus will drop an Atlas Mech, and there is sometimes a final engineer that can deploy a Turret after the mech is defeated, so watch out. Jacob/Brynn pilots a shuttle tasked with picking up Shepard. Destroy the Atlas and the ending cutscene ensues.
Note: Jacob survives this mission and the rest of the events of Mass Effect 3 regardless of his previous loyalty or what choices Shepard makes.
Aftermath[]
Upon completion of this mission, you will gain 12,500 credits, Ex-Cerberus Scientists, and Dr. Brynn Cole to your War Assets. If Jacob is present, he will be recruited as a War Asset as well, and can later be interacted with at Huerta Memorial Hospital. Finally, you can also gain Dr. Gavin Archer as a War Asset provided you satisfied the following conditions:
The Overlord DLC missions in Mass Effect 2 were completed.
If David Archer was rescued from Cerberus at the conclusion of Overlord:
Successfully rescue the Grissom Academy students before this mission.
Set Dr. Archer's mind at ease about his brother if you speak to him.
If David Archer was left with Cerberus at the conclusion of Overlord:
Complete this mission prior to completing Priority: Rannoch.
If Priority: Rannoch has already been completed, do not inform Dr. Archer about the fate of the geth.
Note: Dr. Archer must be talked with to have a chance of gaining him as a War Asset, simply ignoring him won't work.
After the mission, Garrus and James will be found in the kitchen area of the Normandy having a war stories competition. If Kaidan is a member of your crew, he will be in the Crew Quarters with some thoughts about the Cerberus Scientists. Alternatively, if  Ashley is a member of your crew, she will be found in the Starboard Observation Deck giving her thoughts about the scientists.

Private Message
From: Horace
To: Brynn

Brynn, I don't like this. I've managed to get eyes on some of the research the others were doing, and I'm getting a sense of a big picture here beyond anything we could have imagined. In our worse [sic] nightmares kind of imagined.

I'm going to start sabotaging my work. That's how bad it is.

We need to meet up and talk. ASAP.

H.
Personal Log: Damini Sengupta

Attempts are ongoing at figuring out what the end product of our research was meant for. While it is obvious that the delivery system was to be implant-reliant, with evident neurological applications, many questions remain as of yet unanswered. The loss of Dr. Horace Armstrong in particular is hindering our efforts to speedily reconstruct the nature of the Illusive Man's goals. We have several parts of the whole, which lead us to chilling conclusions. But we are nowhere near figuring out what said whole might be--and that is what scares me the most.
Outpost Report: Jacob Taylor

Outpost now 48% operational. We've reorganized some of the storage rooms around the central core, turning them into living units in order to save power. The outer areas are all condemned now, which should provide us with a buffer should Cerberus agents find us.

The guns are functional, but I don't like how exposed they are. I'm going to look into finding us some shielding on the black market.
Personal Log: Brynn Cole

With Jacob's help, we have managed to ascertain that several of our colleagues were, in fact, killed. ""Contracts terminated"" is what Cerberus called it. Makeda, Scott, Daniel, Chun Hei, Anikka... and so many others I didn't even know about. All of them gone, disappeared without a trace. Just like that.

We should have left sooner. I don't know why we waited so long. I can't remember what seemed so important that we had to stay just one more day... What was I thinking?

After the Cerberus attack on the Citadel, listen to the researcher with a datapad sitting at the Courtyard in Presidium Commons, talking to someone on comms. He is on a bench near the billboard for Meridian Place, to the far right from General Septimus Oraka's bench. His team apparently ran out of time digging for the obelisk, and now it's in off-limits territory.
Alternatively, the obelisk can be found during a routine Search and Rescue operation once the Hades Nexus becomes accessible after the resolution of the geth-quarian war. If the object was retrieved in this manner, the mission initially appears in the journal as Citadel: Obelisk of Karza and later updates to the present form once you overhear the researcher talking about it.","Spacious office he's got there
The Hades Nexus only becomes available after Priority: Rannoch. Scan the moon Kopis from the Hoplos system in the cluster and speak to the researcher when you return to the Citadel. The obelisk is an artifact containing Prothean language translations, apparently akin to the Rosetta Stone but for Protheans.
After handing over the artifact, you will gain 5 Reputation, 15,000 credits and an update to the Alliance Engineering Corps War Asset."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Wounded_Batarian,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II
In the Presidium Commons just before the stairs to the courtyard, an angry turian veteran and a human civilian will be talking about a batarian terrorist named Ghorek who is currently wounded, and being held on the Citadel. Simply overhearing their conversation activates the mission.","Upon receiving the mission the Spectre Terminal updates with a data entry on Ghorek containing his location. Note:  Reading it is optional; you can directly go to his location if you have been listening to the angry turian and human talking about him.
Ghorek, batarian terrorist AND terrorist victim
In the Citadel's Docks: Holding Area, go to the back of Cargo Hold C, or that section of the map with numerous batarians. There will be a turian nurse standing outside a refugee accommodation. Talk to the nurse, who tells you about the wounded terrorist's chances of survival, after which you will be allowed to talk to his batarian patient.
Ghorek's terrorist attacks was driven by a desire to avenge his homeworld, Aratoht, the colony destroyed in the Alpha Relay explosion. His motivation is the same, regardless of whether or not you did Arrival. If your Shepard was there, the exchange will be a bit more personal on both sides. Either way, Ghorek asks Shepard for mercy, and to take him off life support. You can either fulfill his request, or let the nurse administer a sedative. If the option to disable the life support is taken, Ghorek will thank you before dying.
Taking Ghorek off life support does not elicit a reaction from the nurse. After completing this mission, you will be granted 5 Reputation, 210 experience and 5,000 credits."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Leviathan_II,Complete Mahavid: Leviathan.,"The artifact is shielded to prevent further unwarranted intrusions
Return to Bryson's lab on the Citadel. After EDI creates a shield around the Leviathan artifact to suppress its energies, search the lab for the next lead.
In the second room of the lab, look for a Project Information terminal. Shepard will inquire about the project Garneau was working on when he died. EDI reveals that it was Project Basilisk, but cannot find more information because Derek Hadley wiped the information from the servers and backups before he killed Bryson.
However, there is a message on Bryson's personal terminal. Head upstairs to listen to the message Ann Bryson left for her father.
You can find 2 clues to add to the galaxy map like before.
The first clue is found in the requisition locker. To access it, in the main room, open the drawer next to the husk experiment. Examine the PDA in the drawer.  This will give you the access card to open the locker. Examine the items in the locker including an Assault Rifle Omni-blade upgrade. Once you look at one of the missing items and one of the items still in the locker, EDI will add the search filter to the galaxy map.
Now examine the wall console in the first room right of the exterior door (it is the one that has the blackout crimes on it).  EDI will tell you that will not be helpful and suggest you look for a ship schematic. Read the datapad on the table across the room from this console, which will show that Ann Bryson flew on a ship called the Icarus. Then examine the computer console enough times to show the Icarus on the terminal, then examine the ship specs. EDI and Shepard figure it is a long range ship so they can rule out a relay system (or else they would have gone with a cheaper ship) adding another filter to the galaxy map.
You now have the precise location of the next mission.
Once you have the location, you can return to the Normandy and investigate the planet."

On the flight of stairs leading to the C-Sec Outpost in Presidium Commons there are two arguing citizens who are planning to kill someone in C-Sec custody. One of them is conflicted and the other one is hungry for justice for their murdered spouses. Talking to them activates the mission.","Maybe it's not such a bright idea to discuss assassinations loudly where nosy Spectres can overhear
While questioning the citizens, you overhear a call from Captain Aaron Sommers informing them that he is in position at C-Sec and needs them to distract the security while he moves in to make the kill.
Go into the nearby C-Sec office and speak to Captain Sommers. The retired Alliance marine concludes that his plot has been exposed and explains that a C-Sec officer is in custody for aiding Cerberus during their attack on the Citadel. The officer is giving intel on Cerberus to C-Sec in exchange for a lighter sentence, but Sommers argues that he deserves to die for having murdered innocent people and executing his own friends. Since the officer is an Alliance veteran, like Sommers, and his actions dishonored the uniform, Sommers feels that it's up to him to deliver justice.
Ex-marine gets antsy for a body count after retirement
You can then choose how to resolve the situation:
Persuade Sommers to call off the hit (Paragon) - Shepard admonishes Sommers and points out that he would be dishonoring the Alliance uniform as well if he takes matters into his own hands. Sommers apologizes and shuts down the operation.
Allow Sommers to kill the officer legally (Renegade) - Shepard invokes their Spectre authority and sanctions Sommers's killing of the officer.
Warn Sommers - Shepard warns Sommers that he will be arrested if he attempts to kill the officer. Sommers leaves disappointed in Shepard's apparent lack of zeal against Cerberus.
Look the other way - Shepard pretends to be ignorant of Sommers's plot, allowing it to proceed.
You will receive morality points based on the above actions, plus 210 experience and 5,000 credits for resolving the mission."

A group of three turian officers can be found chatting inside Purgatory, in an alcove to the right of where James is located at the bar. Listen to their conversation to acquire the mission. You need to complete Priority: Palaven before you can acquire the mission in this way, due to Purgatory being unavailable before that.
Alternatively, you can also acquire the mission if you choose to conduct Search and Rescue operations in Castellus. This second way of acquisition is possible even before the Purgatory becomes available on the Citadel. In this case, the journal entry for this mission is named Citadel: Banner of the First Regiment, though it reverts to its current form after you talk to the turians.","Turian soldiers on shore leave
The Banner of the First Regiment is located on Digeris, the third planet in the Castellus system. Scan the planet to retrieve the item. Return to the Citadel and speak to the turian officer to finish the mission. If you retrieved the banner early, do note that access to Purgatory requires Priority: Palaven's completion.

This mission is automatically acquired and started after the prologue mission's completion.","The outpost entrance. Your squad comes in from the lower right
Before doing anything, it might be wise to make a manual save point. Start by leveling up your squad as prompted. The first few scenes out of the shuttle have some optional View prompts that can help focus on what your squadmates are talking about. If you wish to see the Easter egg in this area, follow the developer directions below. This is the only opportunity to do so as the gap in the fence ahead is a one-way drop.
After going through the gap, you'll see a trio of corpses on the ground. James notices them and Kaidan/Ashley activates their omni-tool near one. 150 XP is awarded regardless of whether you examine the body, though if you do, you'll learn his name was Reeves, and that he was apparently taken unawares. There's also an M-92 Mantis here for pickup: if you don't take it here, you will still have a chance to get it later.
Doesn't look good for employment prospects when your former employer goes terrorist in six months
Up ahead you will hear some gunshots, then you'll see some Cerberus Assault Troopers ahead. The first group will be oblivious to your presence, and if you take a closer look they're executing civilians. You can take them by surprise, you have the higher ground, and they're all standing right next to each other. Make sure to position yourself and your squad in appropriate cover before engaging.
Note:  The View prompt that lets you see the executions up close may fail to appear in some cases such as rushing to the scene, which can even cost you the element of surprise as the Troopers detect your presence.
Another group of Troopers will be hiding behind the various vehicles parked further ahead, attempting to ambush you. Be wary as they will reveal themselves from multiple directions. Take them out accordingly, then move into the compound.
Exploit: Hitting the elevator button inside the complex entrance will instantly trigger the progression cutscene, bypassing any remaining enemies. It is possible to repeat a similar exploit many other times throughout this mission.
Into the Facility[]
There's not much time for cheery reunions, Liara gets down to business and shows where you're headed next
As the elevator pressurizes and Shepard's squad enters the research facility, you talk with the Virmire survivor about your loyalties; Paragon and/or Renegade points are available here. Your conversation is interrupted by sounds of gunfire: an asari is being pursued through the ventilation system by more Cerberus troops, but after dropping down she soon turns the tables on them. Having dealt with the immediate threat, Dr. Liara T'Soni turns to greet Shepard and company.
After a reunion that can vary depending on your past history with her, talk will turn to why she is on Mars. She reveals that she may have discovered a way to defeat the Reapers: plans for ""a device"", buried in the Prothean archives. It's apparent that Cerberus is likely here for those plans, so it's imperative to beat them to the archives, which can only be reached via a tramway that Liara points out to you.
You are again interrupted by Cerberus visitors; much to James's chagrin, Shepard will send him back to the shuttle to safeguard the team's exit, and you will gain Liara as a squadmate for the rest of the mission.
Note:  If James's Incendiary Ammo was applied to any of your squad's weapons, it will appear to still be active after he has left your party, but this is purely a misleading visual effect and it is no longer actually doing anything. You can (and should) activate any other ammo powers your team may possess.
Why waste heat sink capacity when you can simply bend the laws of physics
The cutscene will lead straight into a combat scenario, so be ready. You'll now have access to Liara's powers, and you may wish to pause a moment and allocate any unspent points into them before doing anything else. Kill off the troops that come through; spamming Liara's Singularity several times combined with your squad's fire is usually enough to eliminate all hostiles. Detonating her Singularities with follow-up biotic powers will expedite the process.
Note:  Even if you took health damage prior to entering the facility, you will start this encounter back at full health.
Pick up the med kit on the right (100XP) after finishing the battle. When you try to take the elevator up, you will discover that it has been sabotaged, so raise the vehicle lift, climb up the ramp to the left of the ET3 and jump across.
Head around to the right and open the door, then learn how to grab-kill a trooper from behind cover. Beware of the other enemies in the room afterwards, and expect an immediate close-quarters encounter and at least one grenade coming your way. Tip: It may be safer to clear this room without entering it, or by retreating back outside after performing the grab-kill. Liara's Singularities can easily flush out any trooper that stubbornly remains in cover.
Ariake Tech gauntlets + the Shuriken by the sitting dead soldier at the far back
Enter the next room and examine the datapad on the last row of chairs (75 XP). From here, enter the control room and examine the locker to pick up Ariake Technologies Gauntlets. Continue in a bit to pick up the M-4 Shuriken, and then another med kit (100 XP).
Cafeteria[]
Now, use the security console to unlock one of the two doors. Head to the exposed Martian environment outside and down the ladder into a walkway. At the end of it, right before the ladder up is the Kassa Fabrication Chestplate. After descending the ladder you can use a View prompt to zoom in on a running battle between Cerberus and the remaining Alliance forces on the tramway. Proceed and you'll receive a staticky transmission from James that gets more and more garbled until the storm's interference finally cuts him off completely.
Up the next ladder and after jumping across a gap at the top is a suspiciously open airlock. It's the maintenance entrance to a cafeteria, where a bunch of people died when someone vented the air from it. The lights are out, and you'll switch to flashlights so your vision will be reduced for a while. There's a datapad (75 XP) in the floor just before you descend the steps.
Today's Sunday Surprise is a fistful of omni-blade or biotic punch, courtesy of our new arrivals
The environmental controls highlighted by the HUD are in the room next to the cafeteria. As you descend the steps though, the shutters open to reveal several Assault Troopers, but they cannot see you as your team will switch off your flashlights. While they're discussing whether to check the cafeteria or not if your team is in it, you have the opportunity to grab-kill the closest enemy by leaning below the window. Otherwise, once they're done talking, the two guys closest to the window will move out of a locked door nearby, and you'll be forced to shoot through the glass to get at them instead.
In the cafeteria is an SMG Scope upgrade. Hop over the wall and use the medical station on the right (150 XP). Access the environmental controls to open the locked door and learn that the new researcher Dr. Eva Coré was the one who killed everyone off. A short conversation with Liara ensues where she expresses her doubts about winning a war with the Reapers. Respond how you choose and continue through the door.
Fighting Through the Corridors[]
Always get the drop on your enemies, not the other way around
Pick up the SMG Ultralight Materials and the datapad (75 XP) at the bottom of the stairs. You can then use the weapon bench on the right to change your loadout and apply the upgrades to Liara's weapons, and your own if you carry an SMG. If this is a repeat playthrough (New Game Plus) with the same character, you can equip any weapon or mod you had unlocked in your previous playthrough at the weapon bench. It may be a good idea to equip weapons and mods that can penetrate cover for additional effectiveness against Guardians with their shields up.
Note:  If you are not playing Legendary Edition, the final moments of this mission can be impossible to complete if you are carrying the M-77 Paladin, Scorpion, Acolyte, or Executioner Pistol. It is recommended that you switch them out or ensure that you have at least one faster-firing weapon at this time.
Mere headshots don't scare these other mooks
If you used the weapon bench, any ammo powers you had on your weapons will be reset, so take some time to reactivate them as you want before proceeding. Head up the stairs and through the door for another Cerberus wave. You'll now be facing Centurions and Guardians in addition to the normal Troopers. An Adept or Vanguard can use Pull to reliably remove the shields from the Guardians. Kaidan can use Reave which will go through their shields, or Liara's Singularity can also lift them shields and all, but they must be standing still before she uses it or it may only stagger them. Her Stasis power with the rank 6 Bubble evolution will reliably freeze Guardians and remove their shields, dropping them to the ground after wearing off. Otherwise, just aim at their feet or through the slot in their shields with an accurate weapon; grenades thrown behind them can also be effective. The enemies may not all come charging at you in which case you will have to move forward. Pick up the datapad (75 XP) on the right halfway up the corridor, then go around to the left into a long three-section hallway.
With the exception of Guardians, the Cerberus troops throughout this hallway fight tend to be beating a retreat, so moving up when you can will assist them in deciding to back up even further. Eventually they will retreat out of the section and seal the door behind them, so you don't necessarily have to kill every single enemy. In other words this is a good section to play relatively conservatively. When you turn left around the corner, you will be at a wide hatchway opening, and will need to pass through two additional similar hatchways before the remaining enemies will shout ""fall back to the tram station"" and retreat through the fourth such hatchway.
Would hate to be that guy who got turned into long pork
Next up you will find clean room sterilization controls. Look through the windows to see an orange barrier. Activate the console to move the barrier around the room. Wait until the barriers are maximally open before you deactivate the console. Enter the room to get a Sniper Rifle Extended Barrel, a Shotgun High Caliber Barrel, a med kit (100 XP), and a datapad (75 XP). Continue through the room and out the door on the far right side.
Autoturret and Tram[]
Liara sprinting toward cover while the turret is distracted gunning after Shepard
If you do not already have one, around the corner to the right, you will find the M-23 Katana. Open the door to the next area, and come face-to-face with a huge ceiling-mounted turret. Time to learn how to use extensive cover to avoid fire.
The turret targets you exclusively, so you don't have to worry about your squadmates getting ripped apart. Your squadmates move once you move, and once you move the turret takes a split-second to fire at you. Don't try skipping cover placements as you will not be fast enough to evade the turret's sight, and don't even try cloaking your way out as the turret can detect you. Just follow the on-screen prompts, you'll reach the other side eventually. At that point the turret deactivates permanently.
Exploit: The Cerberus soldiers in the control room will not come out. They are also passive prior to Shepard getting past the turret. Any time before the last piece of cover, an Engineer can spawn a Combat Drone inside the control room and none of the soldiers will react. Wait long enough and one drone can clear the entire room.
They're not guarding the station against threats, they're boxed in the station and there's no way out
Once you've dodged and rolled your way past the turret, open the door and kill off the Cerberus operatives: 4 Troopers and a Centurion. Pick up the med kit (100 XP) on the right, the datapad further up the room (75 XP), and the Sniper Rifle Concentration Mod. Be sure to fill up on ammo.
When you're done looting go and use the auto-turret controls. A short cutscene will have the turret officially deactivated, and Virmire survivor hatching a plan to lure a tram to the station by fooling troops at the archives into thinking that their enemies have been neutralized. Taking a transmitter from a dead Trooper's helmet will reveal that Cerberus has implanted its people with Reaper technology. Shepard then poses as Delta Team waiting for extraction, and Cerberus at the other end sends Echo Team over to help secure the station. More morality points are available in the ensuing conversation with Kaidan or Ashley as they continue to question Shepard's authenticity.
More meat for the Shepard meat grinder
You will get a brief tutorial on squad control in the next area. You can't move and the mission won't progress until you order at least 1 squadmate to move (You can actually order them to move anywhere, not just to the designated position). You can anticipate the arrival of the reinforcements through the long giant screen on top of the gateway: they're on Tram A.
Use superior tactics (or superior firepower if that's not your thing) to your advantage and kill Echo Team exiting the cable car: 5 Troopers, 1 Centurion, 2 Guardians. Tip: Before you activate the cable car, return to the control room and refill your ammo from the cartridges there, which will have respawned. There is also a resupply cache of grenades on the right side of the upper balcony overlooking the tram car. This will be your last easy opportunity to pick up ammo before the hardest and longest fight of the mission.
If you didn't take the M-92 Mantis near Sgt. Reeves at the beginning of the mission, you can pick up another by the cable car entrance.
A bunch of guys in a dogpile is usually more NSFW... although technically this also counts
Get on the cable car and turn it on. Near the other end there will be an explosion: your car will get stuck and a Cerberus one will start moving toward you. Liara's Singularity can pull operatives out of the car and suspend them in the air, dooming them to eventually fall to their deaths. Jump across to the other car once they are dead—or even before, if you like to fight at close quarters.
Tram Fight[]
Activate the other car and prepare for a fight as you arrive in the station: Troopers and Centurions en masse against you and your team.
Having barriers is good, having peripheral vision for those cover-mongering troopers is even better
This is the last big fight of the mission, and it's also very much the toughest you'll have faced so far in the game. Feel free to unleash everything you've got, even grenades. Beware of grenades thrown at you, and be wary of rushing into the smoke thrown down by the Centurions. It's usually safest to stay in the car during most of this fight because the cover offered outside of it is easily flanked, and if you have a reasonably long-ranged weapon the pillar at the rear of the car provides good visibility and is seldom reached by the constant stream of grenades. When the first wave starts to die down, a second one will stream in from the back, this time including some Guardians.
After the fight, pick up the M-15 Vindicator on the far left, investigate the medical station in the center of the room (150 XP), and the Shotgun Shredder Mod on the far right. Warning:  Taking the Vindicator is the absolute last chance to reconfigure your weapon loadout. If you're not playing Legendary Edition and still have a slow-firing pistol equipped, switch it out now.
Once you've finalized your loadout to your satisfaction, open the door at the end of the room.
Prothean Archives Chase[]
The Prothean Archives inside the facility
You find yourself at a large circular chamber. While the Virmire survivor inspects the far side of the room, you and Liara will come closer to the Prothean artifacts at the chamber's center. A hologram terminal will activate nearby, and the Illusive Man appears. A discussion with him occurs during which you can apply a Charm or Intimidate dialogue option depending on your Paragon/Renegade score. At the end of the conversation Ashley/Kaidan discovers the Cerberus mole Dr. Eva Coré stealing the Prothean data, and a chase begins.
If she gets more than 40m away you will fail the mission, so stay close. She will regularly fire Incinerate bolts at you that will stun you and slow you down if they land, so dodge them by performing a combat roll when needed. It's also not worth trying to attack her, as she has an exceptionally high shield recharge rate, and even if you do somehow bring down her shields, she will merely recharge them back to full strength instantly.
Given the urgency of the chase it's easy to overlook how the doctor can outrun your entire team without breathing in Martian air
Further along the chase Cerberus Troopers on a shuttle will arrive on the scene and attempt to harass you. Given the urgency of the situation, ignore them as they won't damage you significantly; if you can't resist, a Singularity from Liara can take care of them.
Warning: There is a moment right before the upcoming cutscene where you climb up a ladder after Eva, and at the top you can fire or launch powers at her one last time. If you are not playing Legendary Edition and have your pistol out at that time, DON'T FIRE, as you will have fewer shots to work with during the final confrontation with her.
At the end of the chase Eva jumps into the shuttle and is about to escape when James crashes his shuttle straight into hers. Your squadmates will pick each other up after the crash, but Eva jumps out of her burning shuttle, her organic disguise destroyed, and severely injures Ashley/Kaidan after the Illusive Man orders her to ""dispose"" of them.
Turns out she doesn't even need to breathe and she's on to you next after disposing of your Virmire survivor friend
After this, Eva will begin running at Shepard in slow motion, and you must shoot her. Shepard wields the currently equipped pistol during this sequence (or the M-3 Predator if no pistol was equipped), and certain pistols with a small magazine or unique mechanics (i.e., the M-77 Paladin, Scorpion, Acolyte, or Executioner Pistol) can make this sequence difficult, if not impossible to complete.
Legendary Edition:  The Predator pistol is always automatically equipped and fully loaded for the confrontation with Eva, with no other weapons available to switch to.
Tip: The key in this sequence is not to fire immediately once you're in control of Shepard again—WAIT a few seconds. Once time really slows down, THEN take your shots. Doing this, it's actually possible to down Eva in as few as two hits anywhere (headshots aren't required). If you start the sequence without a full clip, it is possible to reload in time to shoot Eva down provided you hit reload the instant you're able to. It is also possible to switch weapons if you need to, but again, do so immediately."

Prerequisite: Priority: Rannoch
Listen to an asari consultant's comm conversation with a salarian standing on the right when you exit the hospital elevator. She's with a human assistant, overseeing a trio of patients on the floor (human male, salarian, and either a human female or an asari in armor).
Alternatively, a Search and Rescue operation in the Silean Nebula will yield the artifact and this mission's journal entry. In this case it is labeled Citadel: Rings of Alune.","Patient garb is apparently in short supply due to the war
Note:  The Teyolia system only becomes available after Priority: Rannoch. That is a gap of at least 4 Priority missions from earliest mission acquisition to mission completion.
Scan planet Nevos in the Teyolia system and return the artifact to the asari at the Huerta Memorial Hospital. She needs it to declare a ""cultural crisis"" and get more asari support for the hospitals.
After handing the artifact to her, you'll gain 5 Reputation, 15,000 credits and the Citadel Defense Force War Asset will be updated."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/N7:_Cerberus_Fighter_Base,"Prerequisite: Priority: Tuchanka
You obtain this mission upon cementing the alliance between the turians and krogan. Specialist Traynor mentions this mission in passing, which then adds it to the journal.","Travel to the Horsehead Nebula and then land on the planet Noveria. Hackett will brief you on the way down, and Cortez will drop you on a small landing platform above the main pad.
Clear the area[]
As soon as you land you will find Assault Troopers and Centurions already present on the location. Take out the enemies in the upper area: note that they are dropping down from above to attack you and can throw grenades from there. Then move forward and clear the enemies in the lower area.
Reach the command center[]
Pick the area clean before engaging the control panel
Once you've cleared all the enemies, you'll have one of the few enemy-free periods of the mission, so before activating the control panel, head around and collect all of the items because once you start the next section of the mission it will become difficult.
From where you started, move forward along the same level and around the corner to the left. Head forward and between the doorway and the ladder you can find Spare Parts to salvage (2,000 credits). Go through the doorway and down the stairs, and at the bottom go around to the right for the medical station against the wall and the Pistol Magazine Upgrade on the chairs.
Head around and examine the computer console on the other side of the room. Go down the stairs, turn the corner to the right and salvage the Spare Parts (2,000 credits). Head forward to the console in front of you to salvage a datapad (2,000 credits).
In the corner where the datapad was found high up on the wall are Heating Unit Schematics. Access the medical station on the wall before going outside. Head to the right and at the back of the catwalk you'll find more Spare Parts to salvage (2,000 credits). Turn around and in the middle of the two catwalks is another med kit. Head to the right and in the far corner by one of the red rectangle marked pillars are some more Spare Parts to salvage (2,000 credits).
Once you have collected all the items, return back into the building with the heating unit stabilizers. On the opposite wall to the right of the display, you can find the security console to deactivate. Pick a team member to deactivate the console.
Withstand the Cerberus attack[]
Once the security panel is activated by one of your team members, you will have to fight off a wave of Troopers plus a Centurion and a Guardian with only your remaining squadmate. It's not a large wave but it deploys from all directions, so watch your flanks and be ready to move quickly when a surprise grenade arrives.
When they're dead, you will have to activate the console on the left of the display — if you have not collected the credits and items do so before activating the console, as this is your last opportunity without being harassed.
Clear the landing pad[]
Beware of the enemy's... assets
After the activation you need to clear the landing pad of Troopers, two Centurions, two Combat Engineers, and a Nemesis.
You can choose the indoor path or the outdoor path, though note that the outdoor path gives your enemies the vertical advantage as well as allowing the Nemesis more chances to snipe you. An Atlas will be sent as the last unit you have to deal with, but only once all the other forces are cleared, so you'll be able to concentrate on it exclusively. As soon as you kill the Atlas you will be returned to the Normandy to de-brief with Admiral Hackett.
Note:  Because the mission will end immediately upon destruction of the Atlas, be sure to grab all the items before that happens.
Completion of this mission rewards 10,000 credits, +5 Reputation, and the Advanced Fighter Squadron War Asset."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Shore_Leave,"Prerequisite: Mass Effect 3: Citadel
Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II
Check your private terminal and read the following message from Admiral Hackett to activate the mission.
Priority: Citadel Shore Leave
From: Admiral Hackett

Commander Shepard,

I'm ordering the Normandy into dry dock on the Citadel for much needed repairs. She's seen a lot of action lately and needs a little TLC.

A small army of techs will take care of the details once you arrive, so let's get your crew out of there. You're all on shore leave: that's an order. We need everybody at their best. 

One more thing: Admiral Anderson has an apartment on the Wards. Head over there when you arrive. I hear it's a nice place.

Admiral Hackett","Personal Apartment[]
Upon arriving at the Citadel, select the Personal Apartment option to travel to Anderson's personal apartment on the Citadel. Once you arrive, Anderson will contact you from Earth and he turns the apartment over to Shepard, saying that he no longer needs it.
Take some time and explore the apartment as it is quite spacious. After a short while an automated voice will notify you of receiving a message and the computer in the study will start beeping. This can be ignored. Once you are ready, head over to the Private Terminal on the ground floor in the back where you will have a message from Joker waiting.
Dinner at sushi place on me!
Hey Shepard,

I've got a few things I wanted to go over with you. With the Normandy in dry dock, I figured we could meet up at that Ryuusei sushi place down in the Wards. I hear it's the best.

Joker
Once you are ready, leave the apartment, walk down the hall and use the Elevator to travel to the wards.
Sushi Bar[]
It's all about drinks and umbrellas at first
After leaving Shepard’s new apartment, a taxi will be shown flying through the Citadel and into the wards. Once Shepard arrives, there is a queue, but the host notices Shepard and lets the Commander bypass the line, saying that the table is waiting. Joker and Shepard wave to each other. Head into the back corner of the restaurant and talk to Joker. There are no other interactions in the restaurant save for a brief chat with the host and the bartender each, though there are some amusing conversations between patrons you can listen in on.
Joker comments about the ambiance and the long line outside, nodding to where an Alliance soldier in dress uniform is trying to get Shepard's attention. Shepard then changes the subject to the dry docking of the Normandy. Joker expresses reluctance in letting ""shifty aerospace engineers"" have their hands on the ship, and you can either remind him it's shore leave or agree with him for morality points.
Then the bearer of bad news comes along...
After the small talk, Joker asks why Shepard invited him here, but the Spectre replies that Joker sent the invitation. Their confusion is interrupted by the soldier outside, who has finally broken through the host's defensive line.
When she reaches the table, she introduces herself as Staff Analyst Maya Brooks of Alliance intelligence, and proclaims that someone is trying to kill Shepard. Joker makes note of the fact that Shepard is already being targeted by multiple organizations, and that it isn't news. Brooks restates that the group she is referring to are new people and that they are hacking Shepard's account, communications, and are targeting the Spectre personally. You must offer a response at this, either inquisitive or annoyed, again for morality points.
Shepard then tells Brooks to calm down after she tells a story about the last time she guessed at intel and tells her to start from the beginning.

Citadel Wards: Ambush"
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Volus_Ambassador,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II
After stopping the Cerberus coup, Shepard receives an email from Primarch Victus containing this assignment.
Durlesh MoleFrom: Adrien Victus

Commander Shepard:

Cerberus just ambushed a turian cruiser full of high-ranking Hierarchy officials. The cruiser managed to escape, but its location was top-secret. Cerberus couldn't have located that ship without inside information, and the only other person who knew the cruiser's position was volus ambassador Din Korlack. I've heard ugly rumors of a bounty out for his head.

My advisors insist I can't bring these accusations against Korlack myself. I admit they're right. The turian and volus economies are tightly intertwined, and now isn't the time for the political crisis that would result. But the security of our fleets is at stake.

I ask that you investigate Korlack in your capacity as a Spectre, and find out if he is, indeed, a Cerberus mole. I've forwarded information on his last known location to the Spectre office on the Citadel.

Regards,
Primarch Victus","First, go to the Citadel Embassies floor and go to the Spectre room. Use the Spectre Terminal to receive a location on Din Korlack.
Look under the desk
Then, talk to the turian guard who's at the Office Suite in the Citadel Embassies. Save, then talk to him again. He will let you into the office. There's a terminal in the office containing 3 audio recordings of previous events, hear them out. They're evidence of Korlack's collusion with Cerberus and his severance of ties. If you imported from Mass Effect 2 with Zaeed Massani alive, be surprised to hear his gentlemanly tones.
You only need to listen to the third entry to get the plot going. On the opposite side of the room you will find an earpiece with a link to Korlack. There will be a cutscene and then you will end up at the Presidium Commons. You ask the ambassador for his location, who slyly namedrops ""Selkish Arms"" within his captors' hearing. Head to either Apartment 80 or 94, the ones at the far ends of the hall. Whichever you try first will be the wrong door, and this begins a short timed section of the mission. Hustle to the opposite door without pausing. Note: If you can't open the second door, reload a previous save and try again, moving more quickly between the first door and the second door.
On opening the right door you'll find Korlack, and he won't be alone:
If Zaeed survived the suicide mission and you secured his loyalty on Zaeed: The Price of Revenge, he greets you after disposing of Korlack's other guards.
If Zaeed was disloyal, he dies on the floor after killing the mercs.
If Zaeed was never recruited or he died during the events of Mass Effect 2, a human female and a krogan male stand poised to kill Korlack before Shepard dispatches them.
""You mind, Zaeed?""
After the cutscene, there will be a choice between saving the colony or gaining the Volus Bombing Fleet as War Assets. If you received Zaeed's loyalty, you can choose a Paragon or Renegade option that gets you both.
If you can only have one or the other, to maximize your war assets get the bombing fleet for a net shift of 65 points. The bombing fleet is worth 75, and the Turian Sixth Fleet will lose 10 points from this decision.
Upon completion you will gain 210 experience, 5,000 credits, and morality points depending on your conversation choice. If Zaeed made it out alive, you will be able to find him in the refugee camp and recruit him as a War Asset. If you chose the bombers over Korlack's intel, a news report concerning the unrevealed Cerberus target will pop up in the email inbox after the mission."

This is another item retrieval mission within a mission. Its parent mission only becomes available after Priority: Geth Dreadnought. While exploring the AA Gun Control facility on Rannoch, look for the Jamming Tower Data at the terminal on the right side wall of the left AA Gun setup.
If the data was missed during the mission, it can be also be purchased for 1,000 credits, before discounts or remote access markups, at the Spectre Requisitions terminal.
Once acquired, deliver it to the C-Sec Officer. Completing this mission gives you 5 Reputation, 30 experience and 1,000 credits. It also updates the Citadel Defense Force War Asset."

Alternatively, if you never went anywhere near Purgatory after the failed Cerberus coup, you can retrieve the item and the mission's journal entry on doing a Search and Rescue operation. The mission is then labeled as Citadel: Code of the Ancients.","Angry elcor that doesn't look angry
The Code of the Ancients is on the elcor homeworld, in the Phontes system in the Silean Nebula. Note:  the Phontes system only becomes available after Priority: Rannoch. Scan the planet to retrieve the book regardless of mission acquisition method. Give the book to the elcor just outside the elevator to Purgatory.
Mission completion awards 5 Reputation and 15,000 credits and updates the Citadel Defense Force War Asset."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Shrike_Abyssal:_Prothean_Obelisk,"Prerequisite: Priority: Mars
You can acquire this mission upon overhearing a volus speaking to a human and a turian at the Citadel Embassies. From the elevator, they are located in the far left corner of the area.
You can also acquire the mission and the artifact if you scan the target planet first.","Three diplomats looking slick in their matching suits
The obelisk is in the Urla Rast system of The Shrike Abyssal. Scan the planet Talis Fia and recover the artifact with a probe.
Return the artifact to the volus to be rewarded with 5 Reputation and 20,000 credits.
Note:  This mission can only be completed after finishing Priority: Palaven, which is when the relevant star system and cluster will open for travel."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Mahavid:_Leviathan,"Prerequisite: Leviathan: Find Garneau
The mission's journal entry is automatically acquired upon landing on Mahavid.","On the way down to the asteroid in the shuttle, Shepard, Cortez, and your squad will discuss the mission and the evidence you've found while you were searching Dr. Bryson's lab. After the short mission briefing, Shepard and the squad will land on the asteroid mining facility.
There's bound to be a perfectly good reason why they aren't looking your way
After exiting the shuttle, take the nearby lift down to the main floor. While moving off the lift, your squad will notice a small Reaper scouting party ahead, near the door to the inside of the facility. The Reapers here consist of two Marauders and a Brute. A second brute is upstairs and will not come down if you do not advance too far from the lift. There's plenty of cover nearby, and if you act quickly you should be able to take them out easily. There is an ammo pile on the right wall. Tip: If you hit one of the Marauders with a Stasis bubble before they notice you, it will catch the other Marauder as well, with the added useful effect of blocking the Brute from approaching you until you shoot the Marauders.
Head up the stairs where the Reaper enemies were located to find a Med Kit and a second ammo pile, if needed. Bypass the only accessible door to the right, and head on through to the next room. Here you'll find yourself in a reception room with T-GES Mineral Works employees hanging out, oblivious to the Reaper party that you and your team just cleaned out. Shepard and team will talk to the personnel at the reception desk, and after asking about Dr. Garneau, you'll find that the elevator is inoperable. You'll have to find a way to repair it so you can move on.
Find Dr. Garneau[]
This is just a demo of things ahead
After regaining control of Shepard, you'll be able to look around, eavesdrop on some of the other personnel talking with each other, and find that you now have to repair the elevator. There is a datapad near the group in front of the customs personnel you can interact with to get some more information and 1250 credits. There is another datapad behind the reception desk that also yields credits, 2500. The men behind the reception desk will make threats while you're behind the desk, but they are not hostile.
At the far side of the room away from the door you took to get into this room, you'll find a Repair Drone Terminal you can use to activate a drone to fix the elevator. Stay near it to guide it to the elevator. This section, familiar for those who play multiplayer, also foreshadows the more difficult drone escort later in the mission. After fixing the elevator, take it up to the next floor.
Inside this hallway, you can find a datapad behind a crate of rocks to the left worth 1250 credits. Then move through either door, as both lead to different parts of connected rooms. Staff members ominously close themselves off behind partitions as you approach, and there are various objects you can interact with that show that T-GES Mineral Works is not what it seems. In the room with the potted plants are a terminal and a datapad, each with 1250 credits. The door to crew quarters is locked for now but you won't be able to get in until you find a ""personnel ID"" further on.
They were definitely not looking at explicit holos before Shepard peeked in
Check out the security terminal with the floor map: you need a password for further clearance. Now head to the next room with more creepy workers in conference; behind the 3D display console there's a datapad (worth 1250 credits) on the table and a door to bypass. Inside the room is an SMG High-Velocity Barrel and a datapad (worth 2500 credits) with an undelivered message by Dr. Garneau to Dr. Bryson—which contains a working password for the security terminal.
But before you return to the security terminal, press on towards the medical bay. It's locked for now but your present objective is the security station next to it—a datapad with a working personnel ID can be found there (worth 1250 credits).
Now head all the way back to the crew quarters, with a valid personnel ID you can now enter. There is a Pistol Ultralight Materials mod and two datapads with information date-stamped almost ten years before.
Return to the security terminal and access it. It will play a security footage of Dr. Garneau's arrival to this facility earlier; but more importantly it gives you a patient number for accessing the medical bay. Now head back to the med bay and use the patient number to get inside.
Follow Garneau[]
Once inside, there's a Med Kit available for pickup next to a windowed room with a corpse on a table. Interact with the window to meet Dr. Garneau. After a conversation it turns out this person is being controlled by the Leviathan and it makes the thrall run away. Give chase but after the second door the only way is through the access ladder going outside.
Once outside, follow the linear path towards the objective, and you'll soon notice that the Husks are doing something rare—instead of rushing towards you as usual, they chase after Dr. Garneau. Deal with the stragglers in your way and move on to the next clearing. Grab the SMG Recoil System mod along the way.
A Phaeston shooting flames? Do want
Now this is the main battleground for the remainder of the mission, terrain-wise there's cover everywhere to use and the closest elevation has a Reaper Blackstar for special occasions. It's better to leave the Blackstar there for now and bear with using conventional weapons first. Your objective is at the far end, but this time the Reapers are determined to stop you. Marauders, Ravagers and conventional Husks will drop from above to block you. A pair of Banshees will join in the fight after you've dealt with the initial wave—arguably the toughest fight of the whole level since there are lots of culs-de-sac it's easy for Banshees to trap you in, and it isn't always obvious in the heat of combat which pieces of cover can be jumped over and which can't. The Banshees present a good opportunity to use the Blackstar, though if you think you're good at ducking while under fire you can simply rush to the other side early on and preempt their appearance entirely. Taking one of the Banshees out as quickly as possible will also simplify the situation dramatically.
Warning:  If this is your first time facing Banshees, it's a good idea to look over their page for guidance on how to deal with them. In short, STAY AWAY as they have a lethal grab attack at close range. Their ranged attacks are slow-moving but important to dodge as they deal damage over time that delays your normal shield recharge.
Whatever you choose, there's still a Ravager and a couple of Husks guarding the door that need to be dealt with, if they haven't joined the battle at the open area. Once they're dead inspect the area just next to the door and in front of it for a Med Kit and a Pistol Cranial Trauma System.
Guide the Drone[]
Take note of the cover points while escorting the drone
As you access the door, power goes offline and now you have to escort a vulnerable repair drone to repair two power units, located in the two separate elevated positions from the area you just came through. There's an element of time pressure in this section, since the drone ""shields"" bar gradually depletes even when it's not being shot. Stay close to the drone to guide it, but here comes the second half of the fight: Marauders and Ravagers will crash the party. Once the first repair is complete it's time to escort it to the second unit. Choose your path wisely: the drone is slow to navigate obstacles and will not move without you nearby. As you get close to the second power unit you'll hear the Banshee scream; the good news is that it's the last enemy on this level, the bad news is it comes from behind. If you're low on ammo or have yet to use the Blackstar, it's as good a time as any to unleash it. Once the repair is complete you're clear to proceed.
The Darkness Must Not Be Breached[]
Remote detonation in 5...
Open the door and into the mine, you'll see Dr. Garneau with his back towards the artifact and surrounded by Husks. Instead of giving you a clear shot at the Husks, he detonates the artifact, killing him along with the rest of the Husks.
Examining the area your squadmate will discover the real Dr. Garneau's body. It turns out the man you were chasing was an impostor after all. Some of the facility's personnel, apparently themselves again, approach. Not only have they no recollection of who Dr. Garneau is, they actually have no recollection of anything other than being somewhere dark and cold. When Cortez announces that the Reapers attacking the base have suddenly pulled back, the workers don't appear to know what a ""Reaper"" is. Finally, Shepard asks them what year it is. An asari miner answers 2176—apparently the Leviathan has held the facility's personnel as thralls for ten years."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Reaper_Code_Fragments,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II
Prerequisite: Rannoch: Geth Fighter Squadrons
After the Cerberus attack on the Citadel there's an Asari War Strategist on comms at the Embassy Offices part of the Citadel Embassies (near the elevator). She struggles to comprehend the Reapers' movements and even requests for code samples from Sovereign in the hope of finding counter-strategies. Simply eavesdropping on her will activate the mission in the journal.
Alternatively, you can straightaway acquire the code fragments from the geth consensus prior to resolving the main issues at Rannoch.","The orange highlight contains the code fragments
The code fragment is found near the first infected data cluster you encounter, the segment that's glowing orange but cannot be destroyed by the Geth Combat Software. The code can also be bought from the Spectre Requisitions terminal if you didn't get it during the mission.
After collecting the code, go to the Asari War Strategist and give it to her. This gives you 5 Reputation, 30 experience and 1,000 credits. It also updates the Asari Second Fleet War Asset.
If you purchased the code fragment from the Spectre Requisitions terminal, you might not be able to give it to the War Strategist until you've left the Embassies level and come back.
If you overhear the war strategist again, she recommends redirecting forces to new coordinates based on the intel."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Priority:_Cerberus_Headquarters,"Prerequisite: Priority: Horizon
This mission is acquired immediately after the events at Sanctuary.","Shuttle Bay[]
With fast reflexes the Atlas pictured can be hijacked
You'll land in a hangar bay for one of the hardest fights of the mission: standard Assault Troopers, Centurions and an Atlas Mech will flood in from in front and the right, while a Nemesis sniper camps out above on the left of the upper balconies encircling the hangar, which also happens to be where you eventually need to go to prevent Cerberus from depressurizing the hangar and blowing your entire squad out into space. First thing's first though: order your squad into cover ASAP and clear the immediate area of hostiles. A good place to hide is to the left behind the shuttle.
Tip: If you are fast enough, it is possible to snipe the pilot before he finishes climbing into the Atlas; this tactic is easier with an Infiltrator who can cloak and run forward heedless of enemy fire to set up the shot and also benefit from the cloak's damage bonus. An easier option is to use biotics—Pull or Singularity will stop the pilot. As for Vanguards, a biotic Charge towards the pilot saves the most time and puts you well within Atlas-hijacking distance. The fight is much easier when you have the Atlas at full health.
Warning: During this fight, Cerberus fighters continue to be launched at regular intervals from a catapult device in front of you. If you're too close to the path of the fighter as it blasts out of the hangar bay, it will heavily damage you. The sounds of the imminent launch can clue you in to when to expect this even if your sight is blocked.
Even if you can't jack the Atlas or prevent it from being manned, if you have Sabotage available just turn it to your side; otherwise take it out. A Javelin or other sniper or assault rifle equipped with the right scope mod can be useful here to see through the numerous smoke screens laid down by Centurions, but otherwise just wait them out. Your squad isn't affected by smoke so they should be able to fire without interruption. Use EDI's Decoy to draw fire if you need pressure taken off your team. Once the enemies have been thinned out, EDI will warn you of Cerberus' plan to vent the hangar and tells you to find a control that she can access to override this. Climb up the long ladder on the left to find it.
Warning: There is a time period of about 85 seconds from completing the initial battle to the activation of the hangar venting sequence. A Critical Mission Failure will occur if you fail to disable the venting sequence from the upper level terminal in time, even if you happen to be in the middle of the disabling cutscene at that moment.
Up on the balcony, there's nothing in the little chamber to the left but thermal clips, so turn right and head through the door. After the cutscene, be ready for Cerberus to storm into the room at fairly close range with several Guardians. You'll then have to fight your way around to the balcony on the other side of the room to use the ""Rotation Controls"". Look for a medical station in a dark room opposite to the ""Rotation Controls"" console for XP. Go through the next sets of doors, then, before heading down the ladder, go through another door to activate a PDA for 5,000 credits.
There's enough mechs and firepower for the entire squad, but nope, we have to slog the mission out on foot
Take the ladder down and operate the console to your right, the one with the ostentatious red bars like a jukebox. Admire the boom, and then get ready to fight the Atlas you saw in the cinematic. In addition to that one, there are two more (empty) Atlases in side alcoves on the left and right sides of the room. Two Troopers drop down from above and will attempt to man them; it's a good idea to take them out or disable them before doing anything else. The Atlas on the right is most easily hijacked if you want to risk making a dash for it—once inside, kill the soldier attempting to grab the left-side mech before turning your attention to the first enemy Atlas if it's still around.
Through the Smoking Hole[]
Hop the wall in front of the gaping hole left by the fighter and then before taking the door on the left, snag the M-37 Falcon (it's in the dark a few yards to the right of the door to the left, next to some rubble); you can also use this as an opportunity to change your squad's equipped weapons (though not mods) if you wish. EDI must hack the door for you to enter and a short conversation ensues that confirms the value of having her along as well as previews the upcoming obstacles.
Through the door, there will be a ladder that will take you straight into another fight, so be ready. Once down, immediately sprint for cover, as Cerberus troops are waiting for you. You can flank by going forward from the ladder and taking the loop around and back, but you may run smack-dab into the Nemesis covering the area. Once you've cleared the hostiles, find a medi-gel dispenser and salvage a terminal for 5,000 credits on the far side near the ammo box to the left of the ladder you need to climb. While shopping, listen to EDI and your other companion discuss Cerberus tactics.
200 years into the future, data wiping software still do not work as advertised
In the next room, you will find the first of four video terminals viewable during this mission. The first two consoles give you insight into two of Cerberus's biggest programs: the Lazarus Project, and EDI herself. While not required objectives, the information on them reveals much about both the Lazarus Project and events immediately following Mass Effect 2. If you have a love interest and they are in your party, they will have some personal things to share with you at the Lazarus Project console. Don't miss the Serrice Council Greaves in that room as well (located on some furniture when you turn around from the console).
Penetrate Combat Engineer Defenses[]
Once you're done with this first terminal, head out and into the burning section. There'll be a drop, after which you should turn right; it's another spot where the way forward isn't visible until you're already taking it. You'll immediately be flung into a fairly challenging fight with a bunch of Combat Engineers, Turrets and Shield Pylons all supporting each other in deadly combination. Take this battle slowly and carefully.
They're really going all-out with the defense
Tech abilities and Power Combos definitely come in quite handy here, as can grenades and weapons that deal explosive area damage such as the Venom Shotgun as they can easily destroy Shield Pylons with collateral damage. Overload (and its cousin Energy Drain) will destroy a Shield Pylon in one hit, and Sabotage used against the pylons or their generators can turn them against Cerberus, draining all shields in range instead of recharging them (use caution, as this can also work against your party's shields as well). Sabotage can also hack Turrets, making your life much easier. As you near the end, be prepared to deal with more smoke from several Centurions that drop in from the ladder that is also your exit out of here.
The top of the ladder yields another lore console, this time revealing that EDI started out as the foe in UNC: Rogue VI. If you never completed Grissom Academy: Emergency Evacuation, a datapad on one of the operating tables in this ominously bloodstained room will play an audio log of a captured Jack (if she survived the suicide mission) being tortured by a Cerberus operative. Go through the door, find a medical station and salvage 5,000 credits from a PDA.
As EDI hacks open the next door, you'll have a short radio conversation with Hackett where you convince him not to have the Alliance forces pull any punches in taking out Cerberus. Once through, go across the hall, ignoring for a moment the glowing blue hole in the wall, to find a Medkit, a Delumcore Overlay and the third lore console, this one about Kai Leng. At this point the base will begin to tremble under the assault from the Alliance Fifth Fleet, which elicits a comment from your squad. Once done, backtrack to the blue-lit hole and jump down.
The Human-Reaper Remains[]
Why couldn't Cerberus just let sleeping dogs lie
On the other side of the drop, you will find the remains of the Human-Reaper Larva that served as the final boss of Mass Effect 2. If you destroyed the Collector Base, only its heart will be present; if you spared it, much more of it will be there.
You must now fight your way up the catwalk surrounding the larva's corpse. There are Nemeses, Phantoms and really inconveniently-placed Shield Pylons. Take it slow, keep your shields up and don't be afraid to backtrack: things you can't hit from your current position may be open to other angles of attack.
Combat Tip: If you retreat as soon as the first Phantom enters (once you step on the inclined portion of the gangway after the cutscene) and take it out reasonably quickly, no additional enemies should spawn. Even if you don't exploit this, there is a small area behind where you dropped down that has decent cover positions including a tiny cul-de-sac behind a low barrier where Phantoms can't reach you.
There is the possibility of confronting two named enemies. If Shepard chose to turn Legion over to Cerberus after its acquisition during the Reaper IFF mission in Mass Effect 2, it will appear here as a unique enemy. Furthermore, if Shepard did not complete Grissom Academy: Emergency Evacuation, an indoctrinated Jack will appear here as a unique Phantom. Both characters must be fought and killed if met under these circumstances.
The Illusive Man's Inner Sanctum[]
Illusive Man yet again advocating control
After going up a final ladder after all enemies have been defeated you will be facing an open doorway. Before going through, you can find a medkit and 5,000 credit PDA behind you at the end of the catwalk. Through the door, you'll find yourself in a hallway with multiple computer terminals on either side. To the left you will find an ammo box, another medkit and a final PDA worth 5,000 credits surrounded by scattered cigarette butts. Nearby is another video log where you can learn some chilling details about Cerberus Reaper implants. The door at the end of the hall leads to a dark, cavernous room, empty save for a ramp leading up to a final door. Before entering you may wish to save, as beyond it lies the Illusive Man's inner sanctum, a location the player will undoubtedly recognize.
Entering this room initiates a third meeting between Shepard and the Illusive Man, who, as usual, appears via hologram. As before the Illusive Man speaks of controlling the Reapers. The player is presented with a series of dialogue choices and can either attempt to convince the Illusive Man that his plan won't work, or threaten and berate him for his actions. As in the previous conversations with him, it is possible to use Charm or Intimidate options which can have important consequences later. For now, no matter what you say the Cerberus mastermind remains as implacable as ever, and he cuts off communication just as your team finds the Prothean VI with a final threat to not ""overstay your welcome.""
Vendetta finally reveals the nature of the Catalyst: it is the Citadel! Unfortunately, as the Illusive Man successfully overrode Vendetta's security protocols, he also knows what the Catalyst is. Worse still, he has fled to the Citadel and alerted the Reapers, which have taken control of the Citadel and moved it to the heart of their occupied territory: Earth.
Defeat Kai Leng[]
Before any action can be taken, however, Kai Leng shows up, bent on settling his score with you. You are undoubtedly just as eager to deliver some payback. Get ready: only one of you is going to be walking away from this alive.
It's not a traditional bossfight without periodically summoned minions rushing to aid the boss
The Illusive Man's sanctum is now a battlefield. Leng makes a show of destroying the floor in front of him, gouging out some cover opportunities in the featureless room. As soon as the cutscene ends you may need to use your melee attack immediately because Kai Leng will be on top of you and you'll have to fend him off. You can also do a quick combat roll to the side or behind to avoid close quarters grappling, though you or your squad has to do some damage to Leng to force him to stop chasing after you. After the opening moments of the fight, take cover with your squad in the pit Leng opened in the floor near where you entered from, facing the Illusive Man's chair. Stay on the right with your squad to your left.
Leng's health can't be damaged early on in the fight, and he's immune to most crowd control abilities though he can be slowed by cryo powers. He also uses occasional heavy-melee attacks if you allow him to get close. These attacks can kill you instantly unless you block them by tapping melee. Unless you're a close-range specialist, it's better to keep Kai Leng at a safe distance by distracting him, running away, or dealing severe damage to his shields which makes him retreat.
PROTIP: Shoot out the minions as they descend, or just Lash them into irrelevance if you have the power
When Kai Leng takes heavy damage to his shields he will stop attacking, then run towards specific points in the room, yell, and punch new holes in the floor, creating more places to take cover. Unlike Leng's first floor punch, the ceiling above him gets destroyed too. During these pauses his shields recharge, he becomes temporarily immune to damage, and a wave of Cerberus minions drops in from the holes in the ceiling. He will do this three times.
In the first wave Leng destroys the floor behind the holo terminals, and summons 4 Assault Troopers. In the second wave Leng destroys the floor to the right side of the room, and dropping from the ceiling are 1 Nemesis sniper and 3 Troopers. In the third wave Leng demolishes the floor on the left side and 2 Phantoms drop in. The Phantoms signal the final stage of the fight—once they appear Leng himself can finally be taken out.
Space ninjas gotta pose like edgy posers even in the face of certain defeat
Phantoms and the Nemesis in that order are usually the greatest threats when they're on the field though, so generally take them out first. Apart from that, you can either focus on Leng to drive him off if he approaches, or pick off all the Troopers to minimize incoming grenades. EDI's Decoy can be quite useful here as it draws attention from every enemy including Leng himself. Once Leng and all his minions are down, the fight ends. Note: see bugs below if you find yourself stuck.
After he's defeated, there will be a Renegade interrupt opportunity as Leng sneaks up on you and attempts to stab you. If you don't use the interrupt, Shepard will dodge; if you do, Shepard will block the blade and shatter it. In either case, Shepard follows up with a vicious omni-blade attack—along with some choice words—putting an end to Kai Leng once and for all.
You will then have a last conversation with the Prothean VI with an option for a Renegade interrupt, or if you wait, a Paragon one. Finally, you will return to the Normandy for a debrief with Anderson."

Prerequisite: Arrae: Ex-Cerberus Scientists
You can acquire this mission either by talking to the salarian doctor at the Lab Services in Huerta Memorial Hospital (or simply hearing him speak to someone else), or by finding the poison directly.","Select the microscope
The poison is on a microscope at the control center of the Gellix facility staffed by ex-Cerberus. You can see it to the left as you ascend the stairs leading to the main room, near where Brynn Cole and Dr. Fredricks hold their initial conversation. Select the microscope to take it.
After finding the poison give it to the doctor in the Examination Rooms section of Huerta Memorial. He and his colleagues will use it to come up with an antidote. Upon completion, you will gain 5 Reputation, 30 experience and 1,000 credits. The Turian Sixth Fleet War Asset is also updated.
If you didn't find the poison during the mission it will be available for 1,000 credits in the Spectre Requisitions store.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Priority:_Rannoch,"Prerequisite: Rannoch: Admiral Koris or Rannoch: Geth Fighter Squadrons
To acquire this mission, you need to do either of the two planetside missions to trigger Admiral Raan informing you of the Reaper Base. To start the mission, orbit Rannoch and select the Reaper base.
Note:  If one of the aforementioned missions has not been completed, it will become unavailable once this mission is started.","Coming in Hot[]
Upon arrival at the Reaper base, your squad will be attacked by several geth hostiles: five initial Geth Troopers and a second wave of other Geth Troopers. Eliminate them and proceed down the hill. Once you near the bottom, the large blast door will close and three more Geth Troopers will drop down to impede your progress. Make short work of them. Check near the inside-right of the blast door for a SMG High Caliber Barrel upgrade.
Move to the right of the blast door near the tubes and vault up them. Climb the ladder on the right and eliminate the Geth Trooper waiting at the top. Vault onto the pipe and move forward. Eliminate the two Geth Troopers and Geth Rocket Trooper, and move along the right side to their position. Eliminate the Geth Rocket Trooper on the catwalks in front of you. Pick up an Assault Rifle Piercing Mod. Climb up the pipes, up the ladder, across metal grill platforms, jump across two gaps to find the Kassa Fabrication Gauntlets. There will be a Geth Rocket Trooper shooting you. Climb up the ladder to reach the next level.
Eliminate the geth patrol below you consisting of two Geth Troopers, and find cover. Four Geth Rocket Troopers will drop in, and once they have been eliminated another four Geth Rocket Troopers will siege your position. Once all hostiles have been eliminated, press forward and through the doors. Salvage the Reaper tech on the right for 10,000 Credits.
Fight Your Way In[]
Expect heavy resistance
Proceed up the ramp and destroy the lone Geth Trooper. A blast shield will expand over the Reaper tech broadcasting the signal. At the junction, go to the left to pick up an SMG Ultralight Materials mod and then head back towards the right. As you move along the linear path, numerous hostiles will attempt to impede your progress. Fight your way through the geth forces: two Geth Rocket Troopers, eighteen Geth Troopers. Near the start of the walkway, look for an Assault Rifle Stability Damper upgrade on your right. Once all hostiles have been eliminated, Legion will ask if you need assistance. Grab the Geth Plasma Shotgun and salvage the data worth 5,000 Credits on the left of the door.
Move through the door and salvage more data for 10,000 Credits and a Med Kit. Proceed through a second door and a nav-point will be marked on your heads-up display. Hostile geth will filter in from the left and the right. Eliminate all hostiles before activating the Door Override. Geth will filter in from the left side; once all hostiles have been eliminated, you will be informed that a manual override is needed and will mark a console on your heads-up display with a nav-point. Proceed to the nav-point and activate the Door Override. Legion will inform you that the path behind you has been sealed, but you can use the elevator marked on your heads-up display. Move towards the elevator, but be ready. When the elevator lowers, a Geth Prime will be riding it; eliminate it, and the two Geth Rocket Troopers that drop down, before boarding the elevator. There's a Med Kit to the right of the elevator.
Triple Prime[]
Three towering monstrosities
Ride the elevator up to the next level and be ready for a fight. Three Geth Primes will be standing with their backs to you: one on your left, one on your right, and one straight in front of you. If you don't have weapons effective against heavily armored targets, grab the Geth Spitfire in front of you, but be aware that this weapon has to ""spin up"" with sustained fire to do maximum damage, and Geth Primes are very good at stunning you with their various abilities and attacks. If the first Spitfire runs dry, there will be two others to your left and to your right.
Get quickly into cover, which initially is basically limited to right in front of you coming out of the elevator. It's a good idea not to bunch up too tightly with your squadmates as both Primes and the drones they summon have stunning area-of-effect attacks that can hit you if they hit your squadmates in close proximity. Tip: Using Tali's Sabotage ability on one of the Primes will give you a brief lull during which none of the Primes should be able to hit your squad. Use that opening to unload everything you've got into any Prime in sight even if it's the one you just hacked, as eliminating even one Prime will make the remainder of the fight much easier to handle. Be ready to use First Aid to revive any squadmate that goes down in this fight, and keep using Tali's Sabotage to reduce the amount of fire coming your way, though remember that targets become resistant and then immune to the hacking effect after a handful of uses.
After eliminating the three Geth Primes proceed to the nav-point. Shepard will now produce the targeting laser and equip it as the active weapon. Designate the target by holding down the trigger and making sure that you stay outside of the blast zone, marked by the blue circle. Note that the target is in front and below you, and not where the objective points. Once designated, the Normandy will proceed with its bombing run. The explosion knocks Shepard and their squad off the upper-platform, and a Reaper begins to climb out of the hole.
Your teensy little mass accelerator vs space-tempered Reaper hull. Seems legit.
Legion tells Shepard that it has acquired transport. Sprint to the geth ship. If you don't get there in a decent amount of time, the Reaper will fry you. Shepard will get on top and man the turret while the squad gets inside with Legion piloting.
With the ship on the move, target the Reaper off to the left of the ship while Shepard calls in for an orbital strike. Note that you don't actually have to target or fire at the Reaper; eventually, the vehicle will be at a safe distance and Shepard will yell that they are clear over the comm. When the orbital strike hits, the Reaper goes down temporarily while Shepard orders EDI to sync the quarian fleet to the Normandy's targeting systems. Determined to take down the Reaper, Shepard stays back while Legion retreats to a safe distance with Shepard's squad.
Deal With a Reaper, Personally[]
Move to the center of the plateau and aim at the Reaper. A set of rotating targeting circles will appear, approximately centered on the Reaper's firing chamber (the red ""eye""). Begin targeting the Reaper by aiming and holding down the trigger. The Reaper's first beam will not be targeted at you, being directed at the sky above, giving you ample time to figure out what to do. Note:  If, for some reason, you hold off from firing, Admiral Gerrel will complain about losing the fleet. Soon after, Legion/Geth VI joins him, and soon after that, the game over screen pops up and you'll have to restart.
Beware of beam: very hot
Once the orbital strike hits, the Reaper will move closer and begins to deploy its beam cannon at you. Be prepared to dodge to either the left or the right. Once the beam has sliced past you, the circles will appear again. Only during that time can you aim your targeting laser and begin to compute a firing solution. Not counting the initial strike in which the Reaper is firing at the sky, you will need to complete three additional strikes on the Reaper Destroyer while dodging its beam. It will move closer to you after each strike.
The key to surviving this encounter is to know that, rather counter-intuitively, you don't lose your targeting progress if you have to stop aiming and dodge. Pull up the targeting laser and you'll discover that your firing solution is where you left it and can be resumed. Also note that moving while using the laser pointer causes the target acquisition process to go much slower. The other key is that the Reaper's aim is based on what you are doing when it starts firing, so if you make sure you're standing still until the beam appears, it won't ""lead"" you as much.
Note that on Casual difficulty, you don't have to do this twice; as soon as the beam touches ground, sprint to the side, turn, and fire. The Reaper will finish the attack, recharge, and try again. It won't make it—by the time the beam reaches you, you'll finish targeting and it will be hit from orbit. You only have to move once for every beam.
On Insanity difficulty, it feels like the beam is faster, and being even close to the beam insta-kills you. As a result, you'll need to make wider sprints, giving you less time to fire. The same basic strategy still applies: Run to the side to avoid the beam, then come to a standstill, fire at the eye, and repeat.
Tips: The beam only goes in the direction you're walking, so walking one way when the beam is fired will cause it to head into that direction so you can just walk the other way while aiming at the Reaper. Also, it takes some time for the beam to actually reach you from when the Reaper activates it, so you may charge the firing solution during those few seconds, making the shot easier to complete after you sprint clear.
A normal hit is fiery red, a jackpot hit is colored this.
After the initial strike (the one where the Reaper is aiming at the fleet) and three dodge-and-sprint regular strikes, there will be a final super-slow-motion strike where you must hold your ground, aim, and fire. Unlike the previous strikes where approximate aim works out fine, this final slo-mo sequence requires accurate aim. Take a moment to aim right at the bulls-eye as this is the only way the targeting process will complete before the Reaper beam kills you. That being said, the slowdown lasts 26 seconds (after which you die), and lining up a shot takes only 6 if you aim accurately.
Once you complete the targeting procedure, the game will switch to a cutscene of the quarian fleet firing upon the Destroyer and inflicting fatal damage. In its final moments, the Reaper will address Shepard by name, admitting that Harbinger acknowledges the Commander as a noteworthy opponent; regardless, Shepard's defeat is inevitable. It will also give vague hints on their representing ""order"" and the organics' ""chaos,"" claiming that the Reaper-driven cycle of extinction is necessary ""intervention"" for the preservation of organic races. Depending on your dialogue choices, you will get:
Paragon (top) choice: Paragon dialogue arguing that the races of the galaxy will unite to defeat the Reapers. A Paragon interrupt will follow where Shepard proclaims with grim satisfaction that the unknown species harvested to create the Reaper has now been avenged. The Reaper then shuts down.
Renegade (bottom) choice: Renegade dialogue about taking down the Reapers and putting the organic races on top. The Reaper counters that this attitude is no different from the quarians', implying that the results of this ""philosophy"" speak for themselves. An ensuing Renegade interrupt causes Shepard to target the Reaper one last time, punctuating the Commander's defiant response with a final round of orbital fire.
Ambivalent choice (neutral): No interrupt will occur; the Reaper will proclaim the cycle as an inevitable necessity of harvesting organic species without any possible alternative, and that the true reason cannot be comprehended. Shepard demands a ""straight answer,"" but the Reaper only hints it is related to the organic-synthetic conflict. It then dies.
For all three of the above branches, if any of the available interrupts are not taken, the Reaper utters a final threat: ""Finish your war. We will be waiting.""
Once this exchange ends, Legion/VI enters the scene. Another reckoning is at hand: a centuries-old conflict is about to resolve, one way or another."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Chemical_Treatment,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II
Prerequisite: N7: Fuel Reactors
At Lab Services in Huerta Memorial (left side on the map) there's a human and a salarian doctor (Dr. Silon) discussing a patient who was injured by some chemical agent deployed by Cerberus during their attack on the Citadel. Simply overhearing their conversation activates the mission.
Alternatively, the mission objective and the mission itself can be acquired directly while restarting a fuel reactor on Cyone.","Working conditions must be terrible if they have chemical treatment plans just casually strewn about
This is another item retrieval mission within a mission. Its parent mission only becomes available after Priority: Geth Dreadnought. Head up to the left area at the start, on a datapad that overlooks the radiation below you.
The plans can also be purchased from the Spectre Requisitions terminal for 1,000 credits if you did not take it during the main mission.
Return to Huerta Memorial and hand over the treatment plans to Dr. Silon to complete the mission. He claims it's experimental but he's willing to try if it'll work.
Completion gives you 5 reputation, 30 experience and 1,000 credits. It also updates the Alliance First Fleet War Asset."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Aria:_Eclipse,"Prerequisite: Priority: Palaven
Speak to Aria at Purgatory on the Citadel after retrieving the primarch from Palaven.","Armando-Owen Bailey, Jona Sederis, Sayn
Aria will send you to release jailed Eclipse leader and founder Jona Sederis. Talk to Commander Bailey at the Citadel Embassies, who will insist that you talk to her before he will release her. (Note: The journal entry actually says to speak to the assistant, but he is unable to initiate conversation until you've talked to Bailey). This talk gives you 2 Paragon or 2 Renegade morality points. Head down to the commons and over to the C-Sec outpost to experience her charming personality via vidcomm conversation for additional 2 Paragon or 2 Renegade points.
Afterwards, you speak to Bailey on the screen where Sederis was only moments before. You can either pressure Bailey to secure her release (5 Renegade points), or you can track down the salarian Sayn, Jona's second-in-command who leads the group in her absence, to take over in her place. If you decide to release Sederis there and then after speaking with her, the mission ends with her resuming command of Eclipse.
If you decide that she's a menace, Sayn is on the Docks: Holding Area level of the Citadel, in the processing area near the Shepard VI. Sayn is apparently plotting to bust his boss out of prison, but you will ""remind"" him that he's currently running things. You can convince him to let Sederis rot in jail (2 Paragon), or to kill her upon her ""release"" (2 Renegade). Either way, Sayn will take over.
Walk toward the elevator to trigger a conversation with Commander Bailey. The mission is now complete.
Whatever the outcome, the Eclipse boss will submit to Aria's authority and the Terminus Fleet War Asset will be updated upon completion. The player will be rewarded 210 experience, 5,000 credits and appropriate morality points when the mission is complete."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Batarian_Codes,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II
Speak to C-Sec Officer Jordan Noles on the Presidium Commons. She is standing just outside the C-Sec Outpost.","First head to the Spectre area in the Citadel Embassies and read the message about the batarian codes. Click ""Enable"" while viewing the message. After enabling access, your Citadel map will be updated with the location of the first console. You will go to each console and disable the code used on them. Find the consoles at the following locations and in the following order:
Huerta Memorial Hospital - The right-side lab in Lab Services. Note that the console is accessible from the corridor; no need to actually enter the lab.
Normandy Dock: Bay D24 - Located at the Passenger Lounge.
Docks: Holding Area - At the end of Bay E28.
Note that there are two versions pertaining to how the batarian codes were used: someone used the codes to secure more provisions for the batarians, or they were used in sabotages targeting humans and Alliance military assets on the Citadel.
In comes Noles and out goes Balak in one of the possible outcomes of this mission
When you've disabled the final code at the Docks, someone puts a pistol in the Commander's back. It turns out to be none other than Ka'hairal Balak, if you let him escape in X57: Bring Down the Sky. He will also appear even if the DLC was not completed at all. Infuriated and wanting to take vengeance for the destruction of Bahak (regardless of whether or not you did the Arrival DLC for Mass Effect 2), he blames Shepard for everything that has happened to the batarians. If you let him go in the first game he has been using the codes for petty sabotage, but if you fought him AND left him for dead he has been using the codes for provisions. You can either kill him or pass a Reputation check.
If you do not kill Balak, he leaves, but not before grudgingly committing the batarian fleet to the war. If you kill Balak instead, the Alliance Third Fleet War Asset will have its value decreased.
Noles collars some batarian spook too unimportant to be given a name if Balak was killed or arrested 2 years back
If you killed Balak or handed him over to the authorities in Bring Down the Sky, Shepard will meet up with Noles in Cargo Hold C, near the Batarian State Arms kiosk (and the preacher who laments about the lost Pillars of Strength). Noles has a batarian in custody, who's also angry about his people's condition and having to steal scraps for refugees. In contrast with Balak, if you completed Arrival, this batarian recognizes your role in it. There's no option to kill this batarian: Noles merely hauls him off if you don't want to (or can't) convince him to rally his people to your cause.
Whatever the previous circumstances, as long as Balak or the unnamed batarian is convinced the batarian fleet is added to your War Assets. You will gain 210 experience  and morality points depending on your choices upon completion of this mission.
Note:  The Kestrel Helmet becomes available at Batarian State Arms only if you also secured the batarian fleet. If you killed Balak or let Noles take the nameless batarian away without comment, the helmet will not appear at the store."

This is a standard Search and Rescue mission. Dekuuna is located in the Phontes System in the Silean Nebula. Merely searching between Dekuuna and its moon Oltan will reveal the Elcor Flotilla at the moon and the Code of the Ancients on Dekuuna itself. Despite this mission's name and journal description, scanning and retrieving the flotilla from Oltan is all that's required to complete it; Dekuuna itself can technically be ignored.
Return to the Citadel and speak to the diplomat again to finish the mission. The elcor were able to evacuate, but the ambassador doesn't bother giving prefixes to emphasize how many civilians escaped: ""Not enough."" Completing the mission gives you 5 Reputation and 120 experience.
Note:  It is possible to obtain the flotilla before getting the journal parameters.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Priority:_Earth,"Prerequisite: Priority: Cerberus Headquarters
As noted previously, this mission is part of the endgame sequence. By beginning Priority: Cerberus Headquarters, the player forfeits the freedom to explore the galaxy and cannot (from that point forward) fly anywhere except Earth itself.
Warning: Unlike for most missions, merely traveling to the Sol system triggers Priority: Earth without any opportunity to back out.","Take Out AA Battery[]
Reaper Hades Cannon in London
Hackett and Anderson will walk Shepard through the plan they've put together in the War Room on the Normandy, but this plan runs into complications. Instead of flying straight in, you'll need to stop and take out a Reaper AA Hades Cannon so that the ground forces of Hammer team can land. The assault team that was supposed to deal with the cannon was shot down, so you'll need to reach the crash site and hopefully recover the heavy weapons they had been provided with for this purpose.
Be ready! You are vulnerable to enemy fire the moment the shuttle doors open, and on higher difficulties it's entirely possible to get gunned down before you even land. Return fire aggressively from the shuttle and be ready to purge Defense Matrix (if you have it) or use First Aid. Unhelpfully, your squadmates can't be given any orders until on the ground.
The first battle begins with a seemingly endless stream of Cannibals and Marauders. You begin at the bottom of a hill with your enemies disconcertingly able to rain grenades down from above you. Disrupt them with as much crowd control as you can muster to stem the flow of grenades, and then fight your way up to the top of the hill as soon as you can safely do so.
Tips: Don't forget to activate your squad's passive abilities such as ammo powers while clearing your landing zone. You can use medi-gel freely during these sections because there will be a significant supply of it coming in the middle of the mission.
After fighting your way up from your initial beachhead, grab a piece of cover from where you can see most of what's going on in the surrounding streets. Further enemies will continue to spawn, and now two Brutes will appear from the right, but they will approach from a great distance so you should have adequate time to take them down from afar or at least prepare for their arrival.
You'll be facing numerous well-entrenched enemies immediately, and it won't be getting easier
The Hades Cannon will only make the fight harder, as every time it fires, it violently destabilizes your aim, so it may be safest to keep your head down while it's firing, though landing powers is still possible during the vibrations thanks to the automatic target lock. The shaking effect is in real time, which provides a workaround: if you pull up your power menu, the shaking effect will run its course while the game is paused, allowing you to aim unimpeded.
After you clear out your LZ, continue to advance, taking out new enemies as they appear, until you reach what seems to be the remains of a house. Once the area is completely clear of hostiles before climbing up to the building's upper level, you should be able to make a manual save if you wish. Cortez will also be shot down as you head up to the second story, which might lead to his death if you haven't taken the time to talk him through his personal problems.
Once you emerge on the upper level be ready as Cannibals emerge nearby. Once they are dealt with, advance cautiously as there will be a Ravager guarded by several Marauders waiting at the far end of the structure by the crash site. Once the second floor is clear, make your way over to the wreckage of the shuttle where you will find two M-920 Cains, one of which you will need to knock down the AA gun, and a med-kit. Tip: Locate the second Cain first. Both are situated close to each other.
Warning: If Shepard somehow misses with both of the provided Cain shots when attacking the Hades Cannon, a barrage of missiles can be seen approaching from a distance, and they will strike Shepard through any intervening terrain causing instant death. In other words, game over.
They keep coming, so set phasers to stun rather than kill
Once you've destroyed the Hades Cannon, grab the second Cain, if still available, and then retreat back to the downed shuttle and take cover with your squad. If you do have the second Cain, you will want some room to use it safely against the oncoming horde, which includes a Banshee (which will be named ""Morinth"" if that character survived the events of Mass Effect 2). Do not move towards the edge of the building where the Banshee appears, as waves of Cannibals soon start to spawn. Be aware that the Cain's radius is not as large as a Mass Effect 2 veteran might assume: the weapon is capable of missing its target. Players unfamiliar with the Cain may wish to aim at the feet of the opposition so the projectile explodes even if they miss.
However you decide to take out the Banshee, once it's dealt with you will now have to contend with endlessly respawning waves of Cannibals and survive until you can be extracted by friendly forces. On higher difficulties especially, this can mean a lot of grenades might be coming your way, so watch out. The Cannibals respawn aggressively: the moment you kill one, a replacement will start crawling up and will be attacking you within seconds.  The most painless way to deal with this scenario is to focus on disabling the Cannibals rather than trying to play whack-a-mole. Good ways to do this include freezing attacks such as Cryo Ammo, especially if shared with the squad; the stun effects of Combat Drone or Defense Drone; and biotics such as Pull and Singularity. Weapons that can stagger enemies such as the Scorpion or the M-37 Falcon are also useful for suppressing fire.
""Half a league, half a league, / Half a league onward, / All in the valley of Death / Rode the six hundred.""
After several minutes, a shuttle finally arrives at the far edge of the roof from the downed shuttle to evacuate you. Don't worry about killing everything because you basically can't; simply clear a reasonably safe path to the shuttle and run.
Warning: The shuttle has finite health and won't last forever.  Its health is visible as a status bar in the HUD.  Don't get carried away and miss the boat.
Once safely aboard the shuttle, you're finally reunited with Admiral Anderson. A Paragon interrupt is available upon greeting him, and further morality points can be earned in the ensuing conversation. You discuss the situation, including what's been happening on Earth during Shepard's absence, and the state of the resistance. Anderson also introduces Major Coats, the Alliance soldier who covered your extraction, who credits the admiral with being the main reason the resistance survived at all. Anderson laments that it took the Reapers to finally bring the galaxy together, at which point a squadmate will chime in and point out that Shepard was the true unifying force. After the conversation ends, a cinematic cutscene shows Hammer forcing a landing in the face of heavy opposition.
Meet with Anderson[]
Forward Operating Base, London
You're now in the Forward Operating Base (FOB), where Hammer will assemble before making a move on the conduit. Your squad and Anderson head into the FOB, leaving you with Coats for a short conversation where he tells you of how inspirational you will be to your comrades in arms before leaving to rejoin his unit. Head down the ladder onto the street. Explore the base to engage in final conversations with your squadmates. The number of squadmates can range from as few as three (if Garrus or Tali did not survive the events of Mass Effect 2, or if Tali did not live through the battle on Rannoch, and if the Virmire Survivor died during the Cerberus coup attempt or was not allowed back on the Normandy in its aftermath) to as many as seven (if all possible squad members survived and Javik was recruited).
Through the door on the street is the Communications Tech Officer. You may ask him to speak to Cortez and any previous squadmates from Mass Effect 2 (provided they are alive) via a vidcomm terminal in the building behind the Virmire Survivor's location. There is a datapad across from the street from the Communications Tech officer in between a few trucks. It reads about asking volunteers from the fire patrol. You can listen to interesting updates on the mission by a group of soldiers on the street.
Head up a ramp to the left of the door (it blends into the rubble). You will run into Primarch Victus and Garrus (if alive). Head through the door to the walkway. Make sure that you are ready to leave the area, as you cannot go back through the door.
A cutscene occurs after which you'll find yourself in a turret-gun minigame which ends after a set amount of time. On the other side of the walkway you'll find Liara, two medkits, and a radio conversation if you want to stop and listen. If you speak to Liara, her initial response varies depending on how many enemies you killed while on the mounted gun. There is also a datapad just through the door to the right.
Through the next door is Javik and the current leader of the krogan (Urdnot Wrex/Urdnot Wreav) giving 4 different speeches. If you sabotaged the genophage and Wrex was the krogan leader, Kirrahe or another STG officer (""Colonel Vaykom"") if he is dead will be found at the same spot as the Urdnot Clan Leader, giving a speech to salarian ground forces instead.
Admiral Anderson and Major Coats plan the final assault
Through the final door, you will find EDI, Tali, a medkit, and Anderson, who is conferring with Major Coats. If the geth destroyed the quarians at Rannoch, a Geth Prime will be present instead of Tali. If the quarians were victorious at Rannoch but Tali died in Mass Effect 2, Admiral Raan will take her place.
Once you've spoken to everyone you want to, talk to Anderson. He will tell you the percentage of Hammer team that has reported in. The battle plan is simple: a direct, frontal assault on the conduit with tanks and supporting infantry, including your team, in the hopes of getting forces through the transport beam to the Citadel. Of course, resistance is bound to be heavy, and there's one other problem: a Reaper Destroyer is parked near the conduit. After you tell Anderson you're ready to proceed with the attack and make an inspiring or grimly determined speech to your teammates, you'll have a last chance to pick your final squad and make adjustments. You'll be facing the same enemy types as before, just at a higher percentage and density of the various boss types.
Approach the Conduit[]
Take out the patrol of Cannibals and Marauders that you encounter at the start of the mission. Once the immediate area is clear, you may wish to make a manual save, as opportunities to do so will become scarce and eventually impossible from here on out. Advance until you see the M35 Mako blow up, at which point you'll be attacked by more Cannibals rising out of the rubble, and two more Marauders will also enter from higher level ruins and eventually drop down if not taken out first.
While you may be too distracted by enemies to pay much attention, you can hear voice chatter from allied forces discussing how to take out the Reaper Destroyer guarding the Conduit with only ground forces; a female soldier recommends the use of Thanix missiles, complements of which are apparently available to the various Hammer strike teams.
A Harvester explodes
Proceed until you see another Mako, which will eventually be set upon by a Harvester. You can choose to kill the Harvester for +100 bonus XP, which is fairly easy if you have the right guns or bring squadmates with biotics like Warp and Dark Channel. You can also ignore it and let the problem sort itself out. A Banshee and several more Marauders and Cannibals are also targeting you at the same time. Focus on the Banshee before it can warp in too close but watch out for grenades. More enemy infantry will drop in from the roof of the ruined building ahead as the fight progresses.
Warning:  While the Harvester is alive it only shoots the Mako, but its shots have a wide area of effect, so standing too close to the Mako on either side can severely damage you or your squadmates, though staying behind it is fairly safe.
Tip: The Banshee only appears once the Harvester is either killed or it destroys the Mako and flies away, so leaving the Harvester alive while you thin out the rest of the Reaper troops first can make the fight easier. The Mako survives quite a while under the Harvester's barrage even on Insanity.
Afterwards, you'll receive a call from a fellow Hammer platoon that is pinned down by Reaper forces. The door leading to them is in the far left corner, and it leads to a parking garage. Just before heading in, you'll find the one grenade resupply in this stretch of the mission. Then, if you stand in the doorway of the garage, a single husk will respawn indefinitely until you move inside the door. The door will then slam shut and a group of husks will attack from several directions at once. The single husk will then continue respawning until you move further into the garage, at which point two Brutes and another group of husks will appear to end the encounter. Just give ground as needed and make sure the husks don't grab you as you take them all out. Then find the ladder and climb it.
One marauder disintegrates, three enemies replace it
The ladder leads to an apartment, where a Ravager, supported by other infantry, fires down into the street. If ever there was an ideal place to unload a few grenades, this is it—but be careful as a few will come your way too. Wipe everything out to see the platoon advance, and then loot the apartment, which has ammo and a medkit in the bathroom and another medkit under a corpse outside the bathroom. You can also examine a computer in the apartment after looting. Then, try the door, where Husks will attack you.
The street below is full of Marauders, and it's a great place to use a sniper rifle if you have one. Just beware of the Ravager farther down the street, which will appear suddenly as you head toward a tempting looking pile of ammo, and the Brute that will soon afterwards smash its way out of the shop on the far right corner of the intersection.
The shop where the Brute emerged is your next target. When you reach the window sill, a group of Cannibals and Marauders will appear to stop you. Be careful as you proceed into the shop, as it is a maze of shelves and crates. Two additional waves of enemies will appear suddenly and at very close range as you move deeper into the shop and as you approach its checkout counter, so take it slowly. It's very easy for the enemy to flank from the left. It's very easy for you to preempt that by flanking them first, but that'll expose you to a lot of fire. If you move around too fast, you also risk walking right onto a grenade. There is a medkit on the shelf just before the row of terminals before you re-enter the street.
Not the only Brute you'll be dealing with
Once you've made it through the building, jump back out onto the street. You'll see a huge blown-out pit in the intersection with a concrete pillar slanting across it. Run for this pillar: it's the only cover around when the shooting starts. Then continue across the intersection to the business establishment on the opposite corner. More enemies lurk there, but because you have two windows to attack through, it'll be easy to catch them in a crossfire.
Through the door and past a large crowd of waiting enemies is the restaurant's back dining room. It's got a big window looking out onto a back alley, where even more enemies are going to come from; an obvious solution is to dash to one of the tables and take cover there, but the restaurant's back door is parallel to the door you came through, and enemies can flank you from it if you use the tables for cover. Fortunately, there is a medi-gel dispenser near the window, which might come in handy when the Brute arrives. If you look under a counter close to where the medical station is, you can also find a row of thermal clips in the drawer should you need to replenish your ammo.
Finally, you get to head out into the back alley, where two more Brutes come smashing out through the wall as you approach the end. Retreat while taking them out, and then go through the hole they opened. This room has a datapad you can examine, some thermal clips, and a full resupply of grenades. The next door leads to a cutscene.
Thanix Missiles[]
A ruined intersection will be the stage for your last stand against the Destroyer guarding the Conduit
Note: In this section cardinal directions are used for orientation. For this purpose, north is towards the conduit beam, left when facing the beam is west, etc. Squadmates may call out directions such as ""left,"" again this assumes an orientation facing the beam.
You'll find yourself at a city intersection with concrete barriers strewn everywhere, shops on every corner, a Thanix Missile truck in front of you and another one in the center of the intersection, and directly across from where you entered the area is your target: the Reaper Destroyer, with the conduit beyond to the north. There is ammo scattered around liberally, and medi-gel in every shop except the northeast one; the southwest one, the one you start nearest to, has grenade refills and a M-560 Hydra heavy weapon. The remainder of the game's fighting takes place here. Do not pick up the Hydra heavy weapon yet—you will need it later when you're facing two Banshees at once. Also note that if you pick it up now and drop it ""to move it,"" it will have disappeared by the time you need it.
More of them inbound
The first thing that happens is that your objective changes to ""Secure Missile Battery"", so clear out the hostiles and wait for the Thanix truck's console to become operable. You need to use them against the Reaper, which requires you to link them up to EDI on the Normandy. When the console is ready, you have a respite during which you can, if you wish, take a look around the area to get a feel for your options in the coming battle. Once you activate the console, your objective changes to ""Defend Missile Battery,"" which in practice means kill everything and don't die.  Enemy reinforcements arrive: first a wave of assorted ground troops (Husks, Cannibals, and Marauders) trickles in from the north, then two more waves airdrop in one after the other as you thin out their numbers. The spawn locations of the successive waves depends on your current location. Enemies are tightly clustered upon arrival, so a grenade or Power Combo can deal heavy damage to multiple enemies as they land.
Eventually, a radio message from the female Marine comes in, telling you that you're about to get hit from the left. Marauders, Cannibals, and two Banshees will descend from a raised barricade area down the west branch of the intersection. Those Banshees make a tempting target for your Hydra, but they don't arrive at the same time. Also, this isn't the hardest part of the battle, so resist the temptation and leave the Hydra where it is. A good place to take cover for this portion of the fight is near the second missile truck that's closer to the conduit. Take out the enemies, retreating as necessary when the Banshees get too close.
Note:  Cannibals and Marauders will spawn endlessly until both Banshees have been eliminated, so take them out ASAP.
Once the zone is clear, EDI will announce that the missiles are ready to fire. You again have a respite to collect ammo before activating the console again.  When you do hit the panel to launch the missiles, it becomes clear that the conduit is distorting the missiles' guidance beyond even EDI's ability to correct. To solve this, the Reaper needs to be lured away from the beam, and out of its influence.  Get ready for the final portion of the fight.
Both red and blue beams are one-way tickets to heaven
An important thing to keep in mind is that the Reaper will now be firing its instant-kill beam at you. The beam cannot enter any of the ruined buildings, so hiding in them is a safe bet, though this is a tradeoff as you'll be facing multiple enemies who are incredibly dangerous at close quarters. Fortunately, there are no Cannibals in the final enemy waves so you won't have to worry about grenades. If you decide to stay out in the open, be aware that the beam will strafe down the street in a reliably straight line, allowing you to roll out of its way as you did on Rannoch if you're in the firing lane. A useful tactic is to pull up your Power Wheel every few seconds, whether or not you need to use a power, and turn your view to find the Reaper's beam. Note that the beam will also instantly kill any enemies that walk into its path, as well as your squadmates.
While you're dodging blasts from the Destroyer, you will be faced with a wave of enemies consisting of up to six Brutes, who seem to come in packs of two and can come from any direction, and finally a Harvester, who lands right in the middle of the intersection. Don't waste the Hydra on the Brutes—all you need to do is stay at range from them and you can easily take them down. The same goes for the Harvester—it can be dealt with by hiding in the southeast shop and using the strut between its windows to block incoming fire.
Note: Killing the Harvester immediately triggers the final stage of the fight, though you may still have to kill any Brutes still active.
When the Harvester goes down, the fun really begins. It's finally time to run straight for the Hydra and get ready to shoot the first Banshee you see with it. Especially on higher difficulties, this is not so much about killing the Banshees as it is about slowing them down, as knocking out their barriers will stop them from teleporting for some time.
Fight a delaying action: damage a Banshee's armor enough and it stops glowing and teleporting at you, at least for a while
Now you are basically fighting a version of the same fight you had against the endless Cannibals on the roof by the Hades Cannon in the first half of this mission, except now instead of Cannibals you will be facing endlessly respawning waves consisting of 3-4 Marauders and 2 Banshees. As before, the instant you down an enemy a replacement will drop in, usually at a location towards the conduit beam by the second Thanix truck, though occasionally the spawn point can be closer to the near truck. It's advisable to take cover in a building as far away from the spawn point of the enemies as possible to make things less hairy, or killing an enemy will gain you literally no respite. Place more emphasis on surviving than on racking up a body count.
Tip: Especially on Insanity difficulty where Banshees have a truly obscene amount of health, your best bet may be to keep the Marauders stunned or disabled with crowd control abilities while simply running away from the Banshees. Whenever one of your squadmates goes down, expend a medi-gel immediately to revive them, since this is the last time you will ever need medi-gel, and squadmates draw attention away from you.
Warning: Remember to avoid melee range with Banshees at all costs especially while they're glowing, as they will grab and sync kill you, a gruesome and near-certain death (only your squadmates killing the Banshee before it impales you might save you). Squadmates downed by this attack can only be revived with medi-gel; manual revival at their bodies will not work.
After a few minutes that can seem like hours, EDI will tell you the missiles are ready to fire. At this point, if you've drawn several enemies away from the truck, just run straight for the green control panel, taking care to avoid the Reaper's beam. Use your best defensive and evasive powers, and just get yourself to that button!
The Last Mile[]
The Destroyer finally destroyed
After a cutscene showing the Thanix missiles finally hitting their mark and inflicting a fatal blow on the Destroyer, Anderson rolls up in an armored personnel carrier along with Coats and the remnants of Hammer. It's now time for the final push to the conduit, but Hammer is badly depleted and overwhelming enemy reinforcements are on the way. To make matters worse, Anderson reports several Reapers have broken off from the battle with the Sword fleets in orbit and are approaching the conduit, and that none other than Harbinger itself is among them. Shepard, Anderson, and the squad board the vehicle and head in, while Anderson contacts Admiral Hackett to let him know Hammer is making its move. At Hackett's signal, the Crucible, closely guarded by Shield fleet, enters from the mass relay and heads for the Citadel.
The scene switches to inside Anderson's APC as Shepard and the squad approach the beam. Anderson remarks that they only need to get a handful of forces through the beam to succeed. Shepard makes a final comment on the upcoming battle, either Renegade or Paragon, to which one of the squad members will respond. They are then interrupted by an explosion that cripples the vehicle, forcing the team to exit. Outside, the conduit is now clearly visible no more than a few hundred meters ahead, but everyone's attention is focused on something else: Harbinger has arrived. Descending on the conduit, it begins unleashing its main weapons on the already-beleaguered ground forces, annihilating everyone and everything in sight. There is no more choice and no more time.
RUN.
""Boldly they rode and well, / Into the jaws of Death, / Into the mouth of Hell.""
In the Extended Cut/Legendary Edition, you'll witness the survival or deaths of the squadmates you brought with you depending on your War Asset rating; specifically, get below 2100 EMS (4200 in Legendary Edition) and they're kaput. One indication they'll die is if during the initial space battle at the beginning of the mission the allied ships are prominently shown being beaten by the Reapers.
In case they survive, you get to bid them an emotional farewell as the Normandy makes an emergency drop and pulls them out of the combat zone, doubly emotional if you are in a relationship with one of them. You forge on alone, but one of Harbinger's beams lances directly at you and everything goes white. Once a brief cutscene is over, you'll find yourself badly injured and alone, though you'll still be able to hear allied radio chatter, including Coats reporting that Hammer has been routed. It's all up to you now—press on to the conduit.
(Don't) Take time to line up careful shots, and (don't) aim for the head
The final combat will feel more like a minigame: you won't have your normal powers, armour, guns, or squadmates available. You'll have to defend yourself against three Husks and a single Marauder, but you'll be in slow motion whenever an enemy shows up, and your arm will not be steady, making lining up your shots harder than it seems. If you are having trouble, try walking backwards once the Husks spawn and do not zoom in; while counterintuitive this seems to keep your aim the steadiest. Aim center mass (body shots) to soften them up, slow them down, and maximize your chances of hitting. Landing headshots on the Husks is difficult but will result in an instant kill even on Insanity difficulty.
Tip: Your pistol has an infinite clip and never needs to be reloaded (you can perform a manual reload, but don't). The Husks always appear to your right, climbing up over the edge of the chasm surrounding the conduit, so spamming your pistol at where they will first appear can soften them up a lot before they even fully climb up and time slows down.
Between the Husks and the Marauder, Shepard will fall down once, so you'll know the Marauder is coming soon. The Marauder is always able to hit you once, this is a scripted event and it's impossible to hit it before this occurs so don't worry, but after you recover from the initial hit, it's game time. Walk forward without zooming while aiming center mass, and if you are able, compensate for the sway of your reticle by adjusting your aim continuously. The most important thing in the Marauder encounter is to not miss any of your shots and to fire as fast as possible. You shouldn't worry about head shots, for while they do more damage, going for the head increases your chances of missing completely. The higher the difficulty level, the less time you have to start hitting it before it shoots again and kills you, so don't take too long lining up your first shot.
Note: In the Extended Cut and Legendary Edition, the final Marauder's shields are partially depleted, making it slightly easier to kill.
Once you've put down this last hurdle, the way to the Conduit beam is clear. Make your way through, and another cutscene plays showing the progress of the battle in space. Sword fleets and the Reapers are still locked in combat, successfully buying time for the Crucible to approach the Citadel. Admiral Hackett receives a report that you successfully made it to the station, and he orders the final push to get the Crucible docked.
The Citadel[]
Just another busy Tuesday for Keeper 420
Your exit at the Citadel is littered with corpses and keepers prowl about busying themselves on the bodies. Continue making your way forward; you'll be speaking with Anderson over comms. Apparently the Admiral followed you up, but he came out at a different location, and the Citadel's structure has morphed beyond recognition so both you and he are disoriented at first. You and Anderson speculate that the Citadel has been reconfigured for the purpose of harvesting humanity, possibly turning it into a Reaper.
The far end of the chamber you're in opens to reveal a narrow walkway with gaping chasms on both sides. There's nowhere else to go but forward, and you'll meet Anderson on a platform at the other end. Unfortunately, he's being held hostage by a radically altered Illusive Man. It soon becomes clear that the Cerberus leader has apparently succeeded in his goal of harnessing the Reapers' ability to control organic life, demonstrating this by puppeteering both you and Anderson.
With the stakes impossibly high, the final confrontation begins.
Illusive Man in the flesh... or what's left of it
There are several conversation branches with associated Reputation checks, but the conversation's outcome hinges solely on the final choice. In order to use the final Paragon/Renegade conversational options with the Illusive Man, you must have used Paragon/Renegade options on him at every other opportunity in the campaign, namely the meetings on Mars, Thessia, and the Cerberus base. Be aware that some of these options only become available through using Investigate branches of the conversation, yet they must ALL be used to get the final conversation options with the Illusive Man. If the conversation option is unavailable then a Renegade interrupt is the only way to avoid a Critical Mission Failure.
If you are able to choose the Paragon option, the Illusive Man realizes that he is indoctrinated, takes Anderson's sidearm, and uses it to commit suicide.
The threaten option will offer you one Renegade interrupt; non-reputation dialogue will give you two. Not taking the final interrupt, whenever it happens, will result in a Critical Mission Failure. After you interrupt, the Illusive Man will have a few final words as Shepard opens up the Citadel, allowing him to see that which he has always loved most: Earth.
Shepard will then open the arms of the Citadel, allowing the Crucible to dock. If Anderson still lives, you have one last conversation with him. After another cutscene plays, get ready to make the ultimate decision."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Leviathan_I,"Prerequisite: Citadel: Dr. Bryson
This mission automatically follows after the previous mission's cutscenes.","Investigate objects in Dr. Bryson's Lab for clues. First, check the audio log on the table next to EDI, which leads to the galaxy map search program. As you explore the lab, certain objects will supply search filters to use on the galaxy map program to narrow down the location of Leviathan.
Reaper Activity, Element Zero, Creature Sightings
A complete search of the lab and the upstairs bedroom will turn up six different filters: Blackout Crimes, Creature Sightings, Rachni Activity, Locations with Element Zero, Prothean Activities, and Reaper Activities. Only one filter needs to be selected for Shepard to be able to leave the lab and explore possible Leviathan sites around the galaxy, but you can opt to use additional filters to tighten the search.
Using the Creature Sightings, Locations with Element Zero, and Reaper Activities filters simultaneously will pinpoint the correct location; the Blackout Crimes, Prothean Activities, and Rachni Activity filters are irrelevant and will confound the search, so keep them disabled. Using the three correct filters at once, without the incorrect filters, will net you the ""Conspiracy Theorist"" achievement. This achievement is not present in Mass Effect Legendary Edition.
Activating a filter yields 60 XP each. If you have already determined Garneau's location, feel free to check out the others for additional experience.
While searching the lab, be sure to collect the Weapon Mods: with the lab behind you, the Pistol Cranial Trauma System mod is in the far left corner of the balcony; the SMG High-Velocity Barrel is across from the Rapid Transit; the Pistol Ultralight Materials mod is next to a tree on the right side of the balcony; while the SMG Recoil System is on a shelf near the rachni information in the second room.
With the investigation complete, depart the lab and begin the next mission."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Kallini:_Ardat-Yakshi_Monastery,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II
After the debrief with Anderson and Admiral Hackett in the comm room, Liara approaches Shepard with the news that Asari High Command was insistent on passing along a distress signal. Several asari commando squads have disappeared while investigating the signal. Although she says that the asari have not asked directly, the implicit message is that Shepard should help them. Your journal will be updated with the mission ""Mesana: Distress Signal,"" but neither the journal nor Liara will have any helpful information.","Landing[]
On approach to the planet, Liara will reveal, either in person if she's present or through a videoscreen if not, that she has just found out that the distress signal originated from an Ardat-Yakshi monastery, which is one reason the asari government was hesitant to give them any details at first. You can ask questions about the Ardat-Yakshi and respond how you will, then you will land at the monastery. If Samara survived Mass Effect 2, there will be a vehicle you can examine directly to your right, with one of your squadmates stating that someone recently arrived here. Pick up the Assault Rifle Stability Damper to the left of the door, then proceed.
Screams in the Dark[]
It's quiet...
The elevator is missing, so you will have to jump across the gap and then slide down into the elevator shaft using the ladder on the right side of the platform. A squad member will comment on the noises you can hear as you reach the end of this platform and leap across the gap into a disheveled room.
Explore the room to find a Pistol Melee Stunner and a Glyph upgrade (""Gallae's Electronic Signature"") on the far left, a console with an advisory notice from Matriarch Gallae, a PDA on a table, a Sniper Rifle Spare Thermal Clip and wall-safe (+7500 credits) in a chamber to the right of the entrance door along with a console about daily Ardat-Yakshi life at the monastery, and, where you can't miss it, an asari corpse. A cutscene will play upon examination of the corpse wherein you discover that there is a bomb in the Great Hall of the monastery. Respond how you will, then you will find yourself facing into an open doorway.
Pick up the thermal clip if you need it and go through the door. There is nothing else of interest in this room, so bypass the door and go on to the next room. In this room you will meet Samara, provided she's alive. After the cutscene, turn right to find a PDA beside another corpse. Pick it up to garner 20 experience and the mission Citadel: Asari Widow.
Courtyard Banshee[]
The monastery's courtyard
Head out the door to the left, where a squad member will comment on the unlikelihood of this being a Reaper target. There is nothing of interest, so proceed down the stairs into the courtyard. You are safe for the moment and have time to find a few thermal clips, if you need them, but as you approach the other side of the space, a Banshee will appear for what is likely to be the first time in your game. See its article for full information and tactics on dealing with the creature; the brief summary is stay as far away as possible and shoot it in the head.
After you have taken down the Banshee, several Cannibals will spawn. There is nothing but ammo to pick up, so refill your ammo and move on. On the other side of the door, a cutscene will play showing an Ardat-Yakshi, Falere, fighting a Cannibal. Either Shepard or Samara will defeat it, leading to a conversation about the Reapers trying to turn all Ardat-Yakshi into Banshees. Falere will ask you to save her sister, Rila, from the Great Hall. Respond however you wish, but no matter which option you choose, Falere will learn about the bomb and rush on ahead of you to save her sister by herself. Samara, if present, will go after her.
You can examine the broken elevator on the left side of the room, and there is a computer down the right side to the left of the door that can be examined for 20 experience and to learn that the leadership of the monastery considered the Reaper threat to be a rumor that they needed to protect the students from hearing. Proceed through the door to find several Cannibals and a Marauder. They will not notice you when the door opens, so you have time to coordinate an attack to take out at least one Cannibal before the fight actually starts. As soon as you attack, move into cover to deal with the rest of them.
There is a Disciple shotgun and a Serrice Council shoulder guard through the first doorway on your right, and there is a medical station at the far end of the same room. Go to the room on the other side of the walkway to access two computers, a wall safe with 5000 credits, and a weapon bench.
The computers contain letters that reveal that one of the Ardat-Yakshi, Yanis, has been causing trouble at the monastery. If you kept Morinth alive in Mass Effect 2, one of the computers will instead contain a report from Superintendent Jethra to Matriarch Gallae discussing Morinth's attempts to contact her sisters, and expressing her concerns about security at the monastery.
Antechamber[]
Antechamber as seen from the Banshee's initial location
You can then go down the stairs, where you will encounter another Banshee and several Cannibals. This fight is significantly more difficult than the first fight with a Banshee, because there are not a lot of options for cover until you take out some of the Cannibals, and the Banshee has a habit of following Shepard around. The engagement can be less hazardous if squadmates are told to hold position at the top of the stairs and Shepard retreats to join them when the enemies appear. Once it's dealt with, though, the grand staircase is a great place to defend from.
After you have defeated the enemies, refill your ammo and bypass the door. In the next room you will find an Assault Rifle Precision Scope up the stairs to the left and an asari corpse in the middle of the room next to some crates. Examining the corpse will result in a discussion amongst your squadmates about the unnecessary death at the monastery thanks to Asari High Command's decision not to evacuate when they first heard about the Reaper threat. Activate the elevator to reach the Great Hall.
The Great Hall[]
Medical stations can be found on the left and right sides just as you exit the elevator. There is also a Med Kit lying on the floor, in the center of the room just before the stairs leading up to the bomb. The bomb is on the far side of the room. There, Falere begs Rila to wake up, while Samara stands guard if she is present.
Activating the bomb will initiate a cutscene where Rila will finally wake up, but unfortunately she will attack Falere, because the Reapers have begun to indoctrinate her. After Falere/Samara knocks her unconscious, Shepard will start to look for a detonator for the bomb, but before they can, two Banshees and four Husks will attack.
Your best bet is to take out all of the Husks before the Banshees start teleporting across the room by using powers or weapons that have a large area of effect (e.g. the Venom Shotgun or Singularity); triggering a Power Combo or letting fly with grenades is also very effective. Then, try and get your squad members to draw the attention of the Banshees long enough for you to take them out. Stay away from the monstrosities at all times, running to the other end of the room whenever they get even a little close. Make free use of medi-gel to keep your squadmates active when they fall and to keep your own health up if you get hit by the Banshee's ranged warp-like attacks. Using multiple powers is a good way to get Banshees to stop teleporting, at which point you should shoot at their heads. Again: don't let a glowing Banshee get close if you don't want to suffer a painful death. In the Wii U Version, an M-597 Ladon can be found here.
Conclusion[]
A final act of defiance
After the fight, examine the bomb again to initiate another cutscene. Rila will find the detonator and insist that her family leave with Shepard while she stays behind and sets off the bomb. Falere will fight, but Shepard will drag her to the elevator. Rila will then be attacked by three Banshees, which she is unable to hold off. One will pick her up and stab her with its claws, presumably to complete the indoctrination process, but in a last show of strength, Rila will declare that the Ardat-Yakshi are not the Reapers' slaves and will press the button on the detonator. Shepard and Falere, who is pounding on the elevator doors when the explosion goes off, will make it outside, where you can respond to her anger and grief in the way you see fit.
If Samara is present, at this point she will note that the Justicar Code requires her to slay any Ardat-Yakshi living outside the monastery. To prevent this, she will commit suicide. Fortunately, she can be stopped with a Paragon interrupt. Falere declares she will stay in the monastery, and Samara joins the war effort. If Samara is not present or if she committed suicide, you will be given the decision to either let Falere stay on the planet where she promises that she will not be alive if the Reapers come again, or kill her to guarantee that fact yourself."

Disable Defense System[]
After you evacuate from Aria's ship in escape pods, you crash into a hangar filled with Cerberus operatives. Once you regain control of Shepard, clear the room of Cerberus Troopers and Centurions. If you haven’t already, this is a great time to allocate squad points to Aria. Be sure to pick up the two Medical Kits nearby before advancing. Once you're ready, use the panel to open the blast doors.
Cerberus pesters you and Aria immediately after you land. Don't forget the weapon mod after dealing with them
More Cerberus units are present inside the next room, including Guardians. Aria’s Lash ability may be useful here to players without effective control against them, as it removes their riot shields. Once you clear out this room, look across from the door at the end of the room; there are some crates next to a docked fighter where you'll find some salvage worth 3000 Credits, and an Assault Rifle High-Velocity Barrel mod. After collecting any missed items, use the door on the right to enter an elevator, which takes you to an upper level.
The next area, highlighted on screen as containing the ‘Defense System’, has a point of entry through the right of Atrium 9. Before entering look to your left to examine a computer terminal. Next, you’ll enter what appears to be a ventilation room, filled with more Cerberus troops. Cerberus Engineers are found in this area, and you should try to dispatch them before they deploy Turrets. There is a computer terminal you can examine near the right wall, close to where you entered the area.
Once cleared, Aria will call to Shepard’s attention that the room ahead needs to be pressurized. You’ll have to hold off another wave of Cerberus soldiers whilst you wait. They will enter the room from behind you at this point. There is a lot of cover for you, and it shouldn't be too hard to take them all down. Once the door’s panel turns green, you are able to carry on. Before leaving this room, there is a Med Station to the right of the door on the wall.
After walking down a hallway, where Aria and Shepard comment on the crashed escape pod, you will have to bypass the door which leads to the control room for the defense guns that are ripping Aria’s fleet apart. A short firefight will ensue, but again, there is plenty of cover and it shouldn't be too hard. Aria’s Flare will work wonders against the tightly packed enemies in this room, especially combined with a Biotic-Shepard's Power Combinations if playing on higher difficulties.
The controls for Omega's fancy defense system is too cover-friendly for some reason
The panel in front of the holographic map needs to be deactivated for the guns to stop firing, allowing the fleet to then enter Omega. A short cutscene will play out. While General Petrovsky occupies his time with a game of chess, continue to another elevator. You get a Renegade interrupt to shoot a surveillance camera; if not taken, Shepard alerts Aria to the device, allowing her to shoot at the camera herself.
Before leaving the control room, you can find both a Med Station on the leftward wall and a Med Kit. Before entering the elevator, look up to examine the screen, showing Cerberus troops fighting the other pod's teams.
Moving on, you will be shot at immediately after the doors open, so stay on your toes. You'll find 3000 Credits in a Wall Safe on left-hand wall right as you enter, but don't be distracted by it as you will suddenly face two Assault Troopers and a Centurion attacking at fairly close range from the other side of the counter. It can get a bit grenade-y in the tight space behind the counter if you camp there, so have an exit plan ready. If Shepard carries grenades you can fight fire with fire, as Cerberus doesn't have much room to dodge them either and there is a handy grenade resupply right there on the counter. Clear out the garage, then proceed through the far door.
The Streets of Omega[]
Tuhi District. Updated since Aria's last visit.
You emerge onto the streets of Omega to discover that Cerberus has deployed orange-colored force fields, blocking off certain areas of the station.
Before moving onward, be sure to pick up the 1500 Credits from the salvage next to the dead batarian, a Pistol Heavy Barrel mod to the left of the same corpse. Examine the terminal to activate a Cerberus VI which gives a clue as to how much Cerberus has the station locked down. Later, you will find a Med Kit in the hallway you will need to traverse to continue. Crossing over a crate, you will find more Cerberus soldiers protected by two Shield Pylons. Tip: Start developing some techniques for taking out Shield Pylons and Generators that are hidden from your direct line of fire: arranging for a nearby explosion either by arcing a grenade in or detonating a power combo will make fights like this shorter and much safer, and you'll be seeing a lot more Shield Pylons on Omega.
After taking the Cerberus troops down, another elevator awaits you. When accessing the elevator, Aria comments on the Talon graffiti on some crates. Exit the elevator into a hallway where Shepard can examine another crate marked with Talon graffiti. Nearby, you can find some salvage containing 2250 Credits. Follow the rendezvous point marker to advance.
Closeup of the force fields and newly-dead new enemies called Rampart Mechs. Be wary of mech corpses, they deal damage if you aren't boss enough to be Aria.
Move ahead and turn to the right to see one of Aria's soldiers and jump down to witness a grisly scene, and a new enemy.
Rampart Mechs are synthetic foes that will try and close the distance to effectively use their shotguns. Thus, try and keep them at a distance. Powers that affect armour and synthetics can help dispatch them - and remember that as synthetics they are vulnerable to Overload, Energy Drain, and Tech Bursts even though they appear as armoured. And since you have Aria with you, you can safely unleash any type of combo explosion to eliminate large swathes of them at once. Note:  When destroyed, Rampart Mech remains discharge intense heat for a short period which damages you, squad or enemies upon contact.
Finish them off then join Aria at the force field. There is a Med Kit at the far end of the hall near the force field for you to collect. Aria will then show Shepard a secret passageway with a ladder that leads into the next area. Before following down the ladder, be sure to pick up the Shotgun High-Velocity Barrel mod on the crates in the middle of this small room. There is a Med Station on the leftward wall. When ready, enter Aria's secret tunnels to gain another new squad member.
Meet Nyreen[]
PROTIP: switch to shield/armor-piercing weapon-mod configurations
Meet Nyreen Kandros, a female turian. You can allocate points to her powers from the Squad menu as soon as you regain control. Because there are so many grenade pickups on Omega, leveling up Nyreen's Lift Grenade power can be effective. Her Overload provides excellent shield defeat, and her unique Biotic Protector makes her excellent at taking point for your team.
Before moving on through the next door, there is some salvage with 3000 Credits and a Datapad worth 2250 Credits you can pick up, as well as the N7 Valkyrie assault rifle if you don't already own it through pre-order bonuses. Bypass the door ahead to continue. There will be a weapons bench against the wall to your right. It is advised to use the feature to upgrade or swap out Nyreen's weapons, as she will have started with the most mundane of gear. If you forgot to swap out Aria's weapons at the beginning, you can also do so now.
Aria's Cannons[]
Move ahead down the tunnel, and then use the ladder to get to the upper level. Before rushing through into battle be sure to use the Med Station, that is obscured by the fire near the window opening you can then use to jump onto the balcony below. There will be a large amount of Cerberus infantry on the balcony in front of you. Rampart mechs and even an Atlas will be present. It’s easier to take care of the weaker enemies before concentrating on the Atlas. Once you clear out the first wave, more enemies will jump down. There is a Med Station (on the inner wall of some bar at the left) and two Med Kits (one near the Med Station at the bar and other right on the other side of the battleground), so be sure to grab them before moving forward.
Aria's bunker at Deck 9 besieged
Tip: You can actually shoot through the windows of the small room with the fire. Take out the Atlas from here. Then, if you have a sniper rifle, hop out the window and take cover behind the farthest crate on the left (away from the bridge and cannons) or up on one of the elevated areas across from the window opening. This way no one can flank you while you snipe. Keep your squadmates down low to take care of any enemies that you miss. Their powers really come in handy in this fight. There are also ammo piles on the elevated areas.
Aria's lieutenant, Bray, will point out a target for you. The target is a Cerberus Engineer who is jamming the cannon controls. Concentrate on the other troops before you take him out, because as soon as you do, another Atlas will deploy in front of the cannon controls. Second target is the cannon controls itself. Once you activate it the cutscene will follow, finishing the fight and relocating your squad to the Aria's Bunker, so be sure to grab everything you need beforehand. This may be the quickest way to finish the battle (no need to deal with the Atlas or the other troops) if you have already grabbed everything you need, though it might be easier to deal with the Atlas first to search the place without disturbance.
Note:  Your allies will be firing across the bridge inaccurately. Their shots will not damage you.
Aria's Bunker[]
Inside Aria's Bunker, Aria leaves you to your own devices and says to meet her in the control room to discuss the next leg of the mission. Take this time to acquire two side missions, Omega: Assist the Hacker and Omega: Assist the Mechanic, both of which can be completed in the next mission area. You can also make use of the weapon bench and armor locker in a corner of the room to prepare.
Once ready, speak to Aria. She wants to recruit the Talons to her cause, so she needs to locate their leader. Aria is informed by Bray that Nyreen has vanished from the bunker, but chooses to forge ahead with the mission. You can now exit the bunker via the door Aria pointed out to progress, or continue preparing and acquiring side missions. Speaking to Aria again will provide new dialogue options that shed some light on her state of mind, her past with Nyreen, her thoughts on General Petrovsky and the state of the liberation campaign.
Access the unlocked door when ready.
Talon Territory[]
After the cutscenes, head down the corridor and examine the crates for discussion of the Talons and red sand. You'll learn that Aria believes a turian by the name of 'Derius' is their leader. Head right across the gap and up the ladder to find a datapad (1500 credits) to the left before the stairs.
The Talon outpost
On the right after the stairs you will find the first hacker terminal and a lift control.  The lift is jammed until you shoot the explosive crates on it. Head back down to the now functional lift and use it to get the Assault Rifle High-Velocity Barrel, then return to use the airlock control to access the vents and continue towards Talon territory. (Note:  you can also simply climb over the crates next to the mod you just found and end up in the same vent.)
A datapad (1500 credits) can be found straight ahead soon after Ahz patches you in to Cerberus comms. Examine the control switch and terminal, which you'll find will not work without power. A datapad with a mission report is to the right of the terminal.  Reactivate the generator to operate the terminal, which is not one of the three hacker terminals, and open the air seal to continue.
After you go down the ladder outside the vents, you will find salvage on the left behind some crates (1500 credits). At the bottom of the stairs, you'll find another salvage (1500 credits). Open the door and head down the stairs into a fight with centurions, assault troopers, a combat engineer, and a shield pylon in the far right of the room. The second hacker terminal is in the right corner of the room, when facing the windows with Omega's skyline. There is also a datapad in the room on the left (1500 credits), and a medical station in the corridor leading to the next room.
Rescue Talons[]
A bunch of trapped Talons rescuable through Shepard's intervention
An assault trooper will be standing with his back to you when you open the door, and an engineer waits in the adjacent room.  Take them out and deactivate the lockdown in the next room. A datapad (1500 credits) is in the right corner of the lockdown control room. A medical station is on the left wall of the corridor.
Releasing the lockdown opens the elevator door on the far side of the main room, letting out some Rampart Mechs and a Guardian. A perfect time for a grenade or a fire/biotic explosion! Taking out the mechs while all three are in the elevator may set the guardian on fire. Revive the downed Talon in the other room for some exp and then access the hacker terminal behind him. Enter the elevator once you're done.
It might be prudent to shoot the shield generators first
As you head down the corridor, assault troopers and more Rampart Mechs will run into the corridor from the landing pad. Take them out before taking cover behind the door frame, because a charging mech, an Assault Trooper, a Combat Engineer, and a deployed turret await. You may want to take out the shield pylons at the middle and far end of the landing pad before you finish killing off the enemies here, because as soon as the last one falls a shuttle flies in to drop another wave of Rampart Mechs, Troopers and Combat Engineers, followed by a wave of Centurions, Troopers, and another Engineer. A good way of dealing with them is to use Aria's Flare on them as soon as the shuttle's door opens, and they're still huddled together.
There's a Med Station on the left wall of the area before the first landing pad, and a med kit is found at the lower landing pad drop point. Two more downed Talons are to either side of the destroyed shuttle on the lower landing pad, go revive them for more exp. Then head down the stairs and bypass the door.
Nyreen Returns[]
Dynamic entry!
A short, but revealing, cutscene is given of some Cerberus goons trying to interrogate Talon mercenaries, and Nyreen, hoodless, rescuing them in style.
She is revealed to be the real leader of the Talons. Whatever your reasons for being in Talon territory, the answer is no. Or so Nyreen claims, because whatever you reply to her, she'll be convinced to rejoin you and Aria once more.
After you regain control, you'll be facing the exit. There's a Shotgun High-Velocity Barrel, and a datapad (1500 credits) to grab in the room. Right near the exit there is a Phaeston (provided you don't already have it) next to a med station and a bunch of ammo clips. If you leveled up fighting all those Cerberus goons it might be a good time to bring you and your squad's skills up to speed. When you're ready, go through the doors and take the elevator up.
Meeting the enemy's blade head on
As you enter the open area ahead, Rampart Mechs will start streaming in through the red forcefield to your left, next to two shield pylons. If you have a gun with a decent scope, it may be worth your time to take out the pylons while you're still near the elevator. Once you're down to only one Rampart Mech, an Atlas will show up. Remember that Nyreen has Overload and it's useful against the shields. Not to mention there are two Hydra Missile Launchers in the center of the area, one near the left barrier and the other on the stack of crates towards the right. Deploy them as needed. Tip: Save one of the Hydras for later, as it may come in handy on the upcoming battle at the outpost catwalk.
Afterwards, salvage (1500 credits) on the right side of the room just before a jumpable gap, and a med kit on the right in the open area under the burning shuttle. One more med kit is on the left near the entry point close to the burning fire. Head through the far doors to the elevator.
Your ride is cut short when Cerberus cuts the power. You'll see a ""health"" meter for the latch: shoot it to open emergency access and drop a ladder into the elevator. If you took a missile launcher with you, you'll need to drop it (just switch weapons) to shoot the latch, then pick it up off the floor again. Note: Do not drop the missile launcher prior to the blackout, as it will disappear. Grab the datapad (1500 credits) off the catwalks before descending the ladders in the elevator shaft until you reach the door.
The Catwalks[]
Aria and Nyreen holding position at the outpost catwalk
There will be a med kit immediately on your right as you exit onto the catwalks leading directly to the Talon outpost entrance. There's also some salvage (1500 credits) in front of the burning gap in the catwalks. A shuttle will drop off Cerberus troops behind a smokescreen on the catwalks, followed by two Phantoms, then Centurions, Troopers, and some Nemeses. The Hydra missile launcher from earlier will come in handy to quickly end the fight against the Phantoms. Tip: Don't fire your missile launcher at the first sign of Cerberus - the Phantoms drop in from above a bit after the first shuttle of enemies arrive, so save the missile for them. Again, just switch weapons and the Hydra will drop at your feet for retrieval when you need it.
Warning:  Vanguards will find it prudent to limit usage of Biotic Charge in this section as executing it improperly WILL cause Shepard to die even with full health and shields. See Bugs section below.
There's a Sniper Rifle Thermal Scope on the right-side catwalk near an ammo pile. Pick it up then examine the door at the end to start a continuous wave of Centurions and Troopers dropping down to the catwalks from a bridge above. Tip: Before starting to open the door, turn around and look up at the floor above you, where you will be able to shoot out a shield pylon. There's another one hidden up there on the right as well - you can decide if it's worth lobbing a grenade in.
Cerberus troops will continue to spawn while the door bypass continues. Towards the end, Nyreen will comment that they've hacked the bridge controls, which will prevent two Atlases from dropping into the fight, although they can still shoot you for a while before the bridge closes off.
Talon Outpost[]
Head in through the doors, grab the med kit, then take the elevator to enter the Talon Outpost. After regaining control, there is a Shotgun Omni-Blade immediately on your right. If you revived the Talon in the lockdown room earlier, he will say thanks, and you can overhear more about Adjutants near him. To your left, behind some boxes where a salarian and a turian are discussing medical supplies, you'll find the Kehri Inverter that the mechanic is looking for. A datapad with a scout report is near Nyreen.
""Get over here!""
Talk with Nyreen to kick off the cutscene with Aria's inspiring speech. Looks like Nyreen is not the only one who disapproves of the speech, as Cerberus forces are once again assaulting the outpost en masse. A fight in the landing pad area against Guardians, Centurions, Assault Troopers, and Rampart Mechs awaits, and note that Nyreen won't be joining you on this one since she and her people will be holding the front doors so deploy your standard tactics with only Aria in mind.
Also note that the area before the first door to the landing pad is the last place for manual saving in this section, so take advantage of that fact if you must.
After the fight, there are two more Talons you can revive for more experience - one against the wall to your left, and one in the right back corner near where you came in.
Defend Talon Outpost[]
Mount the turret for an easier time mowing down enemies
Your last fight at the Talon outpost will be at the main gates against Centurions, Troopers, and Rampart Mechs. The last wave will be another Atlas that likes to keep itself concealed with smokescreens. The area is studded with cover barricades and Shield Pylons will be supporting the Cerberus troops on the far end; the pylons can be quite challenging to take out unless you have an accurate scoped weapon, but Nyreen's Lift Grenades can usually take them out. Depending on your moves that may either turn out to be a hindrance or an advantage. There are two turrets by the sealed base door, but they cannot be mounted so fight with your own skills and Nyreen's, who will join you on this. There are also two Med Kits close to the right wall near the entrance. Make sure to grab them before you take out the rest of the Cerberus forces, as this will trigger a cutscene.
However, the turret in the wheeled vehicle just outside to the left of the barricades and accessible via ladder is mountable, so provided you've cleared a path to there you can use it to mop up the remaining goons with less effort. After the fight finishes, you'll automatically return to Aria's Bunker.
Aria's Bunker, Part 2[]
You now have a rest stop at Aria's Bunker. Talk to the mechanic to give him the inverter and finish his mission; the hacker will thank you as well if you stop by. Harrot will ask you to get him coordinates for Aria's couch, and has a few weapon mods for sale at his kiosk.  Make use of the weapon bench and adjust your armor as necessary.
Talk to Aria to go over the plan, and again for further background. Nyreen will be waiting near the Med Bay doors and will ask to speak with you, giving you the opportunity to inquire about her past and what's happening on Omega. Use the door to leave the area when you're ready.
The Mines[]
Eezo Processing Plant[]
To save yourselves the trouble of getting lost here's the general layout of the eezo processing facility with the lights on
First off, note that this section from the Eezo Processing Plant until up to Omega's reactor will be the last section you get to have Nyreen as a squadmate so use and level her abilities to the fullest extent. 
You'll initially be wandering around an eezo processing facility in the dark, so you may want to wait until you power the place up to look for items. If not, no worries, they're still there regardless of lighting conditions.
So at first, just follow the trail of dead Cerberus Troopers. When your companions warn you, turn to the left and you'll spot something jumping over the pipes above. You'll need to head this way.
Aria's idea of a date. Also featuring salvage worth 2250 credits
After finding the powered-down cargo lift and the glowing red power lines turn so the power lines and door are behind you, head up the stairs to the right and around to the left to find salvage (2250 credits) on top of some crates. A datapad across from the disabled elevator controls contains a security memo discussing the facility lockdown.
When that's done, follow the pipes to a ladder to access an upper catwalk. Drop down to the pipes and jump the gap to another pipeline on your right, following the glowing power pipes to another catwalk. Ignore the open doorway and go ahead around the corner to salvage 1500 credits from a pile of boxes.

Adjutants[]
Adjutants are like baby Scions
Head back towards the opening, and jump down into the control room. If you want a manual save, do so before jumping down the control room as it's disabled there. Restore the power to finally catch sight of whatever is infesting the area. A solitary Adjutant will attack your squad, breaking in from a nearby window.
The control center's small, squarish and cramped layout minimizes free movement and keeping a far enough distance will cause the Adjutant to either fire a Singularity or close in by jumping if it finds an unobstructed path to its target. However, using Overload, Flare, Incinerate and your own abilities while deftly moving from cover to cover and/or straight-up unloading on it as Shepard advises should make short work of it.
This area to the right of the cargo lift can be a good spot to whittle the Adjutants down if you can ignore the Singularity spam they may throw at you
Once it's dead, manual saving in the area will be available again. Bypass the door and make your way back to the cargo lift. Once you get close enough, your squadmates will point out that there is another Adjutant in the vicinity. After dispatching it, approaching the elevator will release three more, so don't drop your guard.
Use cover, focus on one at a time, keep all of them within visual range at all times, and it should be pretty simple. Just don't let them get too close to use their powerful melee attacks. The elevator door won't open unless you clear the area, so do it then enter the elevator to advance.

Reach the Reactor[]
Tip: It is easy to get lost in the next area because of its size, paths that converge into each other in squares and a general lack of guidance from the direction finder, so as a rule always orient yourself in the general direction of the massive blue-hued eezo drill far off in the distance. It's also a good idea to take note of the glowing location names in every archway, these locators are fairly unique and pretty much indicate if you're going around in circles or moving forward.
On entering the mines after a long ride upwards, after traversing the catwalk there will be a med-kit immediately to the right, behind some cover just past bins of glowing ore. Turn right into the doorway marked ""EEZO ANALYSIS TESTING AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY"" to pick up an Assault Rifle High-Velocity Barrel right on top of a crate. By this point Cerberus will have been alerted to your presence and sends some goons on your way shortly. Be mindful of shield pylons to either use to your advantage or destroy, and kill all troops you come across.
Looks like they do have things in common
Aria will spot a maintenance lift you can use to reach the upper levels, but Cerberus will blow the bridge before you get to it. Two Nemeses will pop out from the lift on the far side, knowing you can't close in to engage, so prove them wrong by dispatching them long-range. On occasion they may try for the lower ground, and there's a ladder near the destroyed bridge that drops down to the same area. Dispose of them as you will, either way, more Cerberus troops will show up once you slide down from the ladder and you'll have more to kill.
There will be a locked area labeled ""MAINTENANCE AREA"" not far from your initial position. Bypass the door, pick up the Pistol Heavy Barrel, and head down the ladder. There's a medical station on the left just before the stairs, on the area labeled ""AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY CONVEYOR C"". Kill off more Cerberus as you make your way under the conveyor belt. Rampart Mechs are added to the mix, along with a Nemesis, a turret-laying Engineer and a Shield Pylon in their location to give them extra staying power. When you're done open the door to exit the maintenance area and head up the ladder.
For once, ignore Aria on this one
Once you're clear of the ladder, although Aria states ""head up"", ignore the stairs as there's nothing worthwhile in there. Go instead around the corner to the left, to the area labeled ""TRIAGE AREA"". Salvage tools (1500 credits), pick up a Sniper Rifle Thermal Scope, and examine a datapad for information on eezo in the room with bins of glowing eezo ore.
Head up the ladder, which leads to the same location as the stairs, then take out more Cerberus operatives. Don't let yourself be blindsided by Rampart Mechs, it's easy for them to go around you given the number of paths in the area. For ammo refills, head up to the higher ground marked ""AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY"" and dispose of any Cerberus that may have holed up in there. It might be a good idea to hole up in there yourself as it's on higher ground and there are only two easily defensible entrances.
The elevator up is not much farther now; you can use the direction finder safely at this point.
Aria and Nyreen enjoying the view meters away from the mission objective
On exiting the lift, a Combat Engineer will be standing with his back to you as you open the door. Eliminate him any way you want, after turn to your right and take the Shotgun Omni-Blade from the container along the wall, also ammo is there if you need it. Then turn left from the container and follow the path to the dead body to acquire the Chakram Launcher assault rifle.
There's only one way forward, through the door marked ""PEDWAY ACCESS"". In the room is a medical station to the left, a dead trooper crushed between doors you can salvage (1500 credits), salvageable tools (3750 credits) and a ladder down. Head across the unstable catwalks to the final elevator, marked ""MINING COMPLEX"". Your companions will comment on the sudden lack of Cerberus attacks, and indeed no one harasses you even when you reach the reactor level. When you climb up the ladder and see the elevator in the distance, there is another dead trooper (2250 credits) to your left.
After the elevator, if you follow the catwalks curving along the left instead of going down the center, you can salvage equipment (2250 credits) on boxes just to the left of the reactor. There is also an ammo pile near the boxes to the right. This is also the last moment to take a manual save so do it if you must.  Don't stray too close to the reactor after acquiring the goods if you're not ready yet, because...
Reactor Battle[]
Nyreen slaying mechs up close while Aria goes all out at the force field
As you approach, a forcefield lights up - it's a trap! A short cutscene ignites Aria's fiery temper, and she tries to pry open a hole with her biotics. You and Nyreen have to protect her by holding off waves of Rampart Mechs.
Technically, you don't really have to stick with Aria to protect her as your only objective here is to survive all the waves. With that in mind, you can just circle the area's perimeter, gunning down mechs as they come. Go hand-to-hand on them if it's your thing and let Nyreen do the long-range damaging, just make sure to have eyes on the back of your head while doing so.  Alternatively, on higher difficulties, it's better to just hunker down beside Nyreen, make use of her Biotic Protector tactically, and shoot for your life. Now is a good time to spam all your armor-damaging abilities as well as Nyreen's Incinerate, which can be immediately followed each time by one of her Lift Grenades to detonate a fire explosion that will massively damage any nearby mechs.
Aria and Nyreen versus Cerberus
When the waves end, the two combine their biotics to let you through a small gap in the barrier. You'll have to make your way to the reactor alone, and a med kit is immediately to your left up the stairs. Rampart Mechs and Assault Troopers will attempt to stop you. Cover is sporadic and limited to single crates, and you can do one of two things: wing it and beeline for the reactor while outrunning the Rampart mechs dropping from behind and dodging/ignoring the fire, or gun everyone down the slow but safe way. Head around to the reactor controls, another ""AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY"" area. Note:  If you wait around long enough in this area, there will be some extra dialogue with Aria and Nyreen urging Shepard on. Soon after the fourth dialogue, there will be a critical mission failure, stating that you failed to protect Aria and Nyreen, so don't wait around too long.
Once you're there, you're presented with a difficult choice: you can either reroute reactor power to just take down the forcefields, risking both squadmates' lives during your attempt; or, you can use one of several Renegade interrupts to immediately shut down the fields, sacrificing life support for thousands on Omega. However, if you're an Engineer, after skipping the first Renegade interrupt, you can use a Paragon interrupt to reroute reactor power quickly. This class-specific interrupt draws praise from both Aria and Nyreen in the aftermath, whereas otherwise one of them is heavily critical of Shepard depending on which option is chosen. The trio then discuss what to do next, with Aria again pushing Nyreen over her fear of the Adjutants; Shepard can use a Paragon interrupt to demand that Aria drop the subject.
The Assault on Afterlife[]
Support Columns[]
You and Aria split off to take out the bombs before they destroy support columns granting access to Afterlife.
A weapon bench is to your left when you regain control, with a Sniper Rifle Thermal Scope opposite it, plus a med kit nearby. Once you leave the room to engage the multiple enemies waiting for you outside, the bench can no longer be used to change weapons, though it will provide you with continuous ammo and grenade replenishment.
Storm the catwalks, which are defended by Rampart Mechs, Centurions, and Nemeses, buttressed by two Shield Pylons. After you defeat them, the bridge across explodes. Head into the control room, extend the dam then head across. Go to your left to pick up a datapad (1500 credits), then head down the ladder to get the coordinates for Aria's couch (1800 credits) and get a comment from Aria. If you completed all the other side missions, you'll be rewarded with the Meticulous Achievement/Trophy (Note: this Achievement is not in the Legendary Edition). Head back up and continue through the open doorway, grabbing the medical station on your left before bypassing the door.
Take out four Guardians. Open the green door and examine equipment (1500 credits), then bypass the other door to continue. Slide down a ramp, deactivate the spinning fan, then jump the gap to stop the Combat Engineer and Troopers messing with the support columns. There's a med kit on each of the four platforms (two raised, two with giant fans) that line the walls around the perimeter of the room.
Omega's central support columns
Use the access panel controls and all four bombs go live just as Cerberus forces drop in. You have five minutes to disable the bombs. There's plenty of cover in the rigged support structures, simply pop out and shoot anybody who goes near you. It's also fairly easy to get the enemies to train out behind you as you run quickly to each successive bomb, and of course if you're an Infiltrator this whole section will be much easier especially as you can cloak while disarming the bombs. After the bombs are taken care of, clear out the remaining Cerberus forces.
Combat Strategy: On higher difficulties this fight can be challenging, as enemies continuously spawn until all of the bombs are disarmed and they can occasionally drop in on top of you, especially unwelcome if the enemy is a Rampart Mech. Also, be wary of any Engineers setting up Turrets, so don't rush blindly around but check your surroundings carefully; this can be made even more challenging due to the smoke screens laid down by Centurions. Also, keep Aria on a short leash, as if she goes down it can be too dangerous to reach her body for a manual revive and you want her nearby to defend you while you are on defusing duty anyway. Her Reave power is a fairly effective way to make her durable enough to stay alive during this fight, but that only applies if it's used against organic enemies, not the mechs or any Turrets.
Talk to Aria, and she'll take out the remaining fan in the room. Jump the gap, bypass the door, and head up the ladder. A Shotgun High-Velocity Barrel is on the floor behind the next ladder. As you climb it, a bunch of Cerberus get tossed out of the high windows; head left to pick up a med kit and some equipment (1500 credits), then go up the next ladder to witness a trio of Cerberus Troopers getting massacred by an Adjutant, with one getting bashed on a window.
Head through the next door and follow the catwalks around.  A door on the way provides access to a locker (1500 credits). Continue along the catwalks and down the ramp.
Examine the video log for more information on how Cerberus created the Adjutants.  Head to the right of the video log to pick up a datapad (1500 credits). Continue through the door. A datapad pertaining to the escaped test Adjutants is on your right just before the next door. The doors only open one at a time, so wait for Aria to unlock the next door and proceed.
The Gozu District[]
Despite the Atlas and numerous footsoldiers there's a bunch of defensible positions here
Open the door to Gozu district to witness a grenade take out a civilian and knock you back, regardless of your distance from the door. There are a few Assault Troopers and a Nemesis here. As soon as you enter the doorway an Atlas will drop and start circling to your right.
It is recommended that you start this fight from the doorway as this gives you the opportunity to deal with the initial enemies before the Atlas descends. If your weapon has a cover-penetrating mod, you can even remain inside the small room and shoot straight through the windows. Note that you will be unable to return to the room once you leave. The positioning of the troops and the persistence of the Atlas can make this fight ugly, but the terrain can be used to your advantage. There's cover just ahead of you as you enter the room, and then you can slide left and around the corner as the Atlas tries to flank you. From there, you can retreat to an even more secure position behind you, and from there you can even climb up the ladder to pick off the enemies from a distance and protect yourself from the Atlas.
There's a med kit at the bottom of the ladder on the left side of the room from the entrance and a second one on the other (right) side. After clearing them out, head up one of the ladders to open a door for some equipment (1500 credits). Bypass the door on the ground floor and head up a ladder to enter the slums. Aria may have something to say about Mordin shooting up looters in the area; depending on how your campaign has played out so far, Shepard may provide her with an update.
Head to the left for a datapad (1500 credits), then return to the right. A Pistol Heavy Barrel will be straight ahead through the doorway down a short drop.
Head through the next doorway. Examine a dead Cerberus trooper near the back of the crashed shuttle for 1500 credits, then go through the door to fight a Combat Engineer, Centurions, and a Guardian backed by two Shield Pylons. There's a med kit to the right before the stairs.
Paper wanted posters are apparently too low-tech even for Omega.
Head up stairs and bypass the door to enter Talon-held territory. Salvage junk (1500 credits) from boxes near a turian civilian you can talk to, then head through the door on your left to talk to an asari civilian, examine some lab equipment (1200 credits), and use the weapon bench as you will.
Tips: This is your last chance to change your weapon loadout. A weapon mod to ""penetrate light cover"" will come in quite handy in the upcoming section. You might also want to take the Venom Shotgun with you as it will help immensely in the final fight.
Head down the hall past the batarian civilian, and pick up a Shotgun Omni-Blade at the armed barricade. Take the elevator and find out that Nyreen is heading to Afterlife on her own. After the cutscenes turn left for a datapad (1200 credits). You can walk near the group of survivors to hear them talking about Nyreen. Afterwards, save, and then catch up with Aria to face off with Petrovsky in Afterlife.
Note: The amount of credits that you can salvage in this level is capped at 15000, so if you have been picking up everything, you will already have picked up 13800 credits by the time you reach the junk by the turian civilian, and that salvage will thus yield only 1200 credits instead of the full 1500 credits, and the final two 1200-credit pickups will yield only 1 credit each. If you missed credit pickups earlier in this level, these final three pickups will yield their full amounts (up to cap).
The Final Battle[]
The controls for Aria's release are at Afterlife's four corners, don't be stupid enough to lure enemies too close if the shield pylons are active
The final battle in Afterlife is one of the most challenging fights in the entire game. You are alone facing time pressure, as well as an avalanche of dangerous enemies that will constantly respawn until you free Aria from the device imprisoning her in the center of the area.
To do this you will have to destroy a total of four generator pylons arranged in a ring on the lower level around Aria's prison that you must expose one at a time by hitting override controls located at each of the four corners of the upper level. You must free Aria before she is killed by the device; her steadily depleting life bar is visible in the top right corner of the HUD along with a counter that displays the number of active generators remaining.
Adjutants, Assault Troopers, and one or two Nemesis snipers close in on you from all sides throughout; however, you do have one advantage: every time you destroy a generator, Aria will unleash a deadly biotic pulse that deals heavy damage to every enemy in the area, additionally knocking over and disabling Cerberus infantry while leaving you unscathed. This gives you a precious window of time to rush to the next override control to expose the next generator without taking too much fire.
The only way to deal with this first part is to get it over quickly: run and gun to all four corners while retaliating only against immediate threats. It's mildly easier if you're an Infiltrator, who can sneak around relatively unharmed; a Vanguard, using the constant shield restore and mobility provided by Charge; or a Soldier, using Adrenaline Rush to aid in running the gauntlet. Right at the start of the fight, duck quickly to your right and head up the stairs to hit the first override. Without delay, dash immediately towards the next corner where the next override is; halfway there, stop and shoot out the generator you just exposed, then run the rest of the way to the next console killing enemies in your way as you go. Rinse and repeat.
Stay in one place for too long and you run a high risk of getting boxed in by grenades, Adjutant Singularities and sniper fire while the Adjutants (and the occasional trooper) close to melee range. Continuously sprinting around the area to each override terminal forces the enemies to chase you, especially useful against the relatively slow Adjutants. At each override terminal there is a shield pylon that can instantly restore your shields if they go down as you run the gauntlet, but be warned that they can also restore shields to your enemies. Take them out if they aren't part of your strategy.
You will face fewer total enemies the faster you destroy all four generators and free Aria. Once she is free she rejoins the fight and her abilities are available for use again. A final wave of enemies enters the fray, but now enemies killed will no longer respawn. Aria is unkillable once freed, so don’t worry about putting her in cover or protecting her.
Combat Tips:
You can be absolutely swarmed by enemies in this fight, so weapons and powers that deal area damage can be very useful, as can grenades if you have them available. Unload everything in your arsenal without holding back.
At least until Aria is freed, all enemies remain singularly focused on Shepard, to an unusual degree: they will totally ignore Decoys, Combat Drones, or Sentry Turrets, and even the Dominate power will not cause any enemy to shift its focus away from Shepard, including the target of Dominate itself.[1]
On Insanity, it's almost impossible to avoid being nailed by a Nemesis at least once or twice in this fight as you move around the area. Some ways to deal with this are having as high a rate of shield recharge as possible, having the Defense Matrix bonus power for instant shield restore, or by using the shield pylons.
If you see a large number of enemies blocking your path to one of the override controls, you can run towards a different terminal instead if you don’t think you have the firepower to take them all at once.
Assault Troopers and Nemeses are regularly and endlessly replaced when killed, so taking them out provides only a temporary respite.
Adjutants do not endlessly respawn in quite the same way: you’ll never be facing more than two at a time including the two in the area at the start of the fight. Each time a generator is destroyed, two more Adjutant replacements are ""unlocked,"" meaning killing an Adjutant will cause another to spawn almost immediately until there are two in the area again. This only occurs after the first three generators are destroyed, so a maximum of eight Adjutants can be encountered, and you will face far fewer if you don't kill many before blowing the final generator.
The most defensible locations are in any of the corners by the override consoles as there are only two approaches on either side you can defend, ammo and grenade refills nearby, and a shield pylon.
Use an accurate bullet-firing weapon to destroy the generators after exposing them, not powers or explosive projectiles such as those fired by the M-37 Falcon as they are much less reliable (though the sticky rounds fired by the Scorpion are an exception and tend to work well). Guns that can penetrate thin cover either inherently or with a piercing mod can be used to destroy the generators from less exposed vantage points.
Interestingly, generators can be ""pre-killed"" by shooting the cylinders even before they extend after hitting the overrides. Doing so will cause the generator pylon to explode immediately after hitting the override that exposes it without having to shoot it again. This may or may not be useful in practice as you may want to time killing the generators so that Aria's biotic shockwave buys you the most amount of time.
Once all of Petrovsky's troops are dead you can find two med kits, one along each of the long pathways against the walls on the upper level. When you're ready, bypass the door to face the Cerberus general in his den."

I'm betting on you!
From: Hoshichiri Saburo

Commander Shepard:

We're big fans of yours out on the asteroid belts, and we're working double-time to try to get the raw materials out for the war effort. I was hoping you could settle a bet we're having.

The issue is thermal clips. A friend of mine says they're the worst thing to happen to our military in fifty years. They take time to reload, create effective ammo shortages, blah blah blah. I say if you can conserve shots and use biotics or omni-tool weapons, ""ammo"" shortages don't mean squat. 

Can you do a match where there aren't thermal clips lying around? Against these big bad Collector things we're hearing about now? I can totally cut you in for half the bet if you do.

In for the win,
Saburo","Select ""No Thermal Clips"" as a modifier from the Combat Simulator Control terminal. You'll need to purchase the modifier from your previous match winnings—it is a silver level prize. Though Saburo requested Collectors as the enemy, it is not required. The other settings are up to you—since most challenges are not mutually exclusive, you could conceivably finish other nonconflicting arena challenges at the same time, e.g. Citadel Arena: Prothean Challenge and/or Citadel Arena: Spin Zone Elite Challenge.
This challenge becomes easy if you choose to use the newly acquired M-7 Lancer or, if you have one, Particle Rifle because both have unlimited reserve ammo.
After the match, check the terminal again for the follow-up e-mail. You'll receive 5000 credits and +2 Reputation for completing the mission.

Commander Shepard:

I knew you could do it! You should have seen their faces! It was like those stages of grief; they got quieter and quieter as the match went on. At the end, they were muttering, ""Well, sure, but that's Commander Shepard, there's got to be an exception..."" Thanks again, and as promised, here's your cut.

Listen in on the asari scientist sitting at the Bank area of the Presidium Commons. You will find her only after you stop Udina's coup.
Alternatively, a Search and Rescue operation in the Athena Nebula will yield the statue and this mission's journal entry. In this case it is labeled Citadel: Hesperia Period Statue.","Coups are no excuse to stop working
Scan the gas giant Polissa in the Vernio system of the Athena Nebula to find the statue. Once acquired, deliver it to the asari. She needs the statue for some classified project because it has highly accurate Prothean inscriptions, and she has no pictures of the thing.
You will gain 5 Reputation, 15,000 credits and an update to the Alliance Engineering Corps War Asset."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Priority:_Geth_Dreadnought,"Prerequisite: Priority: Perseus Veil
This mission is automatically acquired after the meeting with the quarian admiralty.","Make your way through the ruins of the docking tube alone. If you've played Mass Effect 2, you'll find the spacewalk sequence reminiscent of Prologue: Save Joker: you can only walk slowly and move your camera around. In addition, since you're in a circular tube, you'll be plodding your magnetized boots along the inner ring to navigate through obstacles, which may result in a mild case of disorientation. The walk won't take long and is not overly complicated, opportunities to banter with associates arise at three moments to relieve the boredom: when looking at the profile of the dreadnought, when looking up (or down) at Rannoch, and about 3/4ths of the way down the tube.
Once you've reached the end the tube will detach, leaving you separated from your squad and the Normandy. Enter the Geth Dreadnought. Proceed down and to the left to grab a Shotgun Smart Choke, then climb back up the ledge and circle to the right to get to a ladder directly across from where you came in. Once you have climbed up the ladder, go right and through the door. In this new airlock there's 1875 credits (""Geth Data"") to the left, and your goal up another ladder on the right. Activate the controls, and a cutscene will play. Pick up the Arc Pistol before continuing; it's next to the docking controls where Tali left it during the miniature cutscene.
You will enter the geth defense network. Move along the linear path, grabbing GARDIAN Defense Data and a Sniper Rifle Enhanced Scope, and activate the bridge controls. Eliminate all geth hostiles and move forward and down a ladder. You will find more geth troops at the bottom.
Once they have been eliminated, move along the path and through the door, but be careful advancing: there are Geth Trip Mines on the floor. They can be shot to cause premature detonation, but they blend in pretty well. To conserve ammo, a better tactic is to activate them then perform a combat roll backwards to get out of its blast radius. This is also handy if you trip one by accident; roll backwards the moment you hear the Trip Mine activate. One can also use powers to set them off from a distance; Shockwave is one such power that works for this purpose. Grab more Geth Data (+2500 credits) before passing through the next door, which leads to a room with the Archon Visor in it, plus two sensor consoles that will update you on the progress of the battle; the room beyond it contains a network console and the Geth Pulse Rifle. Finally, you will arrive at the Operations Center where Tali intends to shut down the Reaper signal.
Operations Center[]
Operations center with scale model hologram of the dreadnought
Of course, the Operations Center is manned, particularly by Geth Hunters, who use optical camouflage to sneak up on you and decimate you with their shotguns. They can only maintain invisibility while their shields are active, and the invisibility isn't perfect: if you catch the slight visual distortion, shoot it to make it targetable. Powers can also be used for this, such as Overload or Tali's Energy Drain, however you must aim them precisely on the cloak distortions to land hits as you can't lock on to them while they're cloaked.
Combat Tips: This first encounter with Hunters is quite dangerous especially on higher difficulties, as three of them will be closing rapidly on your position from multiple directions and at least one can be on you within a few seconds (usually from the left). Manually order your squadmates into nearby cover immediately as they have a tendency to run forward straight into the Hunters' shotguns after the cutscene. Tali's Defense Drone is a fairly effective tool against Hunters as it will instantly zap and stun a Hunter in range the moment it decloaks to attack, so be sure to activate it if available the moment the fight starts. Using Sabotage to hack any of the other geth in the area is also a good idea to keep extraneous threats off your back while you focus on eliminating the Hunters. Helpfully, your squadmates will call out if there are still any Hunters active in the area.
Once everything's dead, move out, being wary of Trip Mines. Grab the SMG Scope and Geth Data (1250 credits). You can also examine a Data Console near the middle of the room before activating the target console. Tali will inform you that you need to get to the drive core to accomplish your mission. Tali will then open the maintenance tubes and geth will flood inside, including up to four Hunters. Eliminate the hostiles and proceed to the back left of the operations center to enter the maintenance shaft. Bypass the door, then go around left to go down the ladder. Continue around and drop down a second ladder. Pick up the Geth Data (1250 credits) on the left, and go down another ladder. Finally, pick up the med kit and head through the pair of doors into the Main Battery.
Main Battery[]
Bzzzt
This space is where the dreadnought's titanic main gun resides. Every time it fires, an electromagnetic shockwave will come screaming down and deal heavy damage to you (eliminating your shields or wounding your health) unless you're in cover. Get used to the timing; you're going to spend a lot of the remaining mission in this corridor. Fortunately, the shockwaves are pretty obvious, and furthermore ""in cover"" just means ""using a chest-high wall,"" not, ""actually ducking."" If you've popped out from cover to shoot, the shockwave will not hit you. Standing behind tall cover without attaching to it is also fairly safe, but not foolproof. Energy Drain or Defense Matrix can provide a quick shield boost if you're accidentally snagged by a shockwave.
Note:  Squadmates, enemies, and summoned drones, turrets, and Decoys are not harmed by the main gun shockwave.
Two waves of geth will appear soon after you enter the corridor. It's possible to just stay put and let both waves come to you; if you'd like to be more aggressive, a raised control post to the right offers flanking potential, but be careful of being flanked yourself as you'll be facing more Hunters. In any case, your squadmates will tell you when it's safe to move, at which point you should head up the hall and take a left to find a maintenance lock. A small ramp to the left, just before the maintenance lock, has some geth data you can salvage for 1250 credits. Once you've activated it, you'll want to sprint. Dawdling inside the maintenance lock for too long will result in the electrical shockwave frying you and a game over screen.
The view inside the maintenance lock might be mesmerizing, though it's deadly
You are now on the opposite side of the main battery, but the shockwaves haven't finished yet.
You'll almost immediately be engaged by the geth. If you go straight forward from where you start, you can take a ramp to a catwalk where the geth are shooting down at you from, but this exposes you to a lot of fire very quickly.
Alternatively, you can turn right from your starting point and take a ladder up to the other side of same catwalk, but the same problem occurs. You'll have to climb up eventually, though, because the way forward is a ladder on the far side of that catwalk. Clear the area and advance all the way to hit a dead end. Take the ramp on your left up to another control post, which has a locked door perpendicular the main cannon.
Bypass the door and go through a second door to reach the elevator platform area.
Before using the elevator platform, go around the outside to the right for more geth data (1875 credits).
Move onto the platform and access the platform controls. A miniature cutscene will be triggered as you and your squad progress upward, showing two geth with ML-77 Missile Launchers. They will shoot the bottom of the platform, causing it to collapse. Sprint forward toward Tali before it collapses completely, and she'll help you up. Loitering there for a while for whatever reason will cause the platform to collapse, taking you with it and resulting in the game over screen.
Proceed up the ladder, collect and go past a med kit, and go through the door to enter the drive core, triggering a cutscene.
Drive Core[]
The drive core will reveal the hardware the Reapers are using to distribute their control signal: Legion (or a ""Geth VI"" if Legion is absent), who will shut down the signal if you release them.
You'll be fighting off waves of geth all the way till you reach the ladder on the far side once you push the button that frees the geth unit
Grab the Assault Rifle Precision Scope and geth salvage (2500 credits) and then take either the platform or the ladder up to the top. If you took the ladder move around the outside to the data core override. Access the panel to free Legion or the Geth VI, who will then shut down the dreadnought's drive core.
Multiple enemies will drop in shortly afterward, including Geth Primes. These hulking robots are heavily armored and shielded and their cannons deal heavy damage at range and are very good at suppressing you; they can also summon drones and turrets. Tali's Sabotage is once again invaluable here: converting a Geth Rocket Trooper, Geth Hunter, or even a Geth Prime into a temporary ally creates the space you need to thin out the enemy ranks. There is very little spare ammo to be found in this fight, so be efficient and make good use of powers and your squad.
Eliminate all hostiles and proceed back around the half-circle balcony to get to the ladder. From here, you're basically in the clear. You can take your time to look around; the ship will not explode with you in it. Move through the linear path until you reach the hangar. The walkway will collapse beneath you. Run up the ramp to your geth friend to end the mission.
Aftermath[]
The missions Rannoch: Admiral Koris, Rannoch: Geth Fighter Squadrons, and N7: Fuel Reactors become available.
The Argos Rho cluster becomes available, allowing the completion of Citadel: Kakliosaur Fossil.
Legion or the Geth VI will occupy the Normandy's war room. Admiral Raan's reaction to the incoming geth will depend on whether the geth was present before in Tali's Loyalty Mission or not.

After the Cerberus attack on the Citadel, talk to the Clinic Doctor in the Docks: Holding Area. He is located in the center of Cargo Hold: B. If Conrad Verner is alive, he appears in front of Bay E24 and you also need to talk to him to unlock the mission. Otherwise, merely speaking to the doctor will suffice.","The Clinic Doctor will be talking on the phone about someone sabotaging the Medi-gel Dispensers. If he also complains about someone trying to convince refugees to join Cerberus, go to the section of the walkthrough detailing the version with additional characters; it is a bit more complicated.
Basic Mission[]
The refugee doctors having trouble with the med dispensers
Walk around the Docks: Holding Area to find 3 Medi-gel Dispensers. There are 4 dispensers around the docks but you only need to fix 3 before returning to the doctor. Find them just outside Cargo Hold: A on the right, inside Cargo Hold: A immediately to the left, Cargo Hold: C near the clump of batarians and the kiosk for Batarian State Arms, and one in Bay E28 in the corner.
Once you have repaired 3 Medi-gel Dispensers, go back to Cargo Hold: B to talk to the Clinic Doctor. He will thank you for your efforts and fret over being unable to track down the saboteur, and the mission will end.
With Additional Characters[]
If the doctor complained about a Cerberus propagandist, go to Bay E24, on the window side of the area and nearest to the Memorial Wall. There you'll find none other than Conrad Verner.
Conrad admits to preaching about joining Cerberus. Shepard explains that Cerberus just tried to kill the Council and Conrad realizes he made another mistake. You find out his Cerberus contact was the one sabotaging the Medi-gel Dispensers while Conrad was distracting the refugees.
At the end of the conversation you will receive Conrad's Dark Energy Dissertation, a War Asset that surprisingly has a contribution to the Crucible's construction. If you also imported the following variables from Mass Effect, the dissertation quintuples in asset value. It is all or nothing; skipping even one will forfeit the bonus.

Repair the medi-gel dispensers as in the basic version of the mission, and then talk to the doctor. Doing so triggers a final scene with Conrad and his Cerberus contact. His contact pulls a gun on Shepard and Conrad dives in slow motion in front the Commander attempting to intercept the bullet, providing enough distraction for Shepard to punch the contact in the face.
If you did the Citadel: Rita's Sister assignment in Mass Effect and got Jenna out of Chora's Den, she had sabotaged the contact's gun, thus saving Conrad's life, and the two wander off together. If not, Conrad is shot for real and killed."

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Priority:_Eden_Prime,"Prerequisite: Mass Effect 3: From Ashes
Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel I
This mission is acquired by downloading the Mass Effect 3: From Ashes DLC (Legendary Edition:  available by default) and accessing your personal terminal. It is immediately available upon gaining free rein of destinations in the Normandy SR-2 after departing the Citadel.
Priority Mission: Eden PrimeFrom: Alliance Command

Commander,

Cerberus has attacked Eden Prime and is now occupying the colony. Alliance forces are stretched too thin right now to attempt to liberate the colony, but we've been doing what we can to covertly aid the local resistance.

In the process, we've learned that Cerberus has uncovered a major Prothean artifact. We don't know what it is, but it appears to be the reason for the attack on the colony. We need you to infiltrate the colony and recover the artifact.
Note:  This mission can be completed at any time between when it first becomes available and before Priority: Cerberus Headquarters.","Head to the Exodus Cluster and land on Eden Prime to begin the mission. On the shuttle ride in, the team discusses the last time Shepard was at the colony, and the consequences of what finding more Prothean technology could lead to. If you are playing an imported game, you'll have a short conversation with the squadmate who isn't Liara about your previous mission to Eden Prime; otherwise, you will only tell Liara it's a good thing she's here this time given her expertise on the Protheans.
The Stasis Pod[]
There are no dinosaurs here...
After you have been dropped off, follow the path until you reach the first set of buildings. A viewpoint ahead will trigger dialogue between your squadmates. Enter building 6 on your right. Salvage the computer (+3000 Credits) and open a Med Kit (+300 XP). Examining the terminal will trigger the mission Eden Prime: Resistance Movement and give you the first piece of Cerberus intel.
Make your way to the Nav-Point outside and use the elevator console. A cutscene will follow in which Liara discovers that Cerberus has uncovered a living Prothean in stasis. They damaged the Prothean's lifepod during excavation, and the life signs are unstable. To open the pod without killing the Prothean, a command signal has to be found to end the stasis mode, and a way figured out to physically open the pod without doing more damage. There are two labs nearby where Cerberus are researching what they found at the dig site.
A Cerberus shuttle will then fly overhead and drop off two Nemeses and a Centurion at a distance: eliminate them.
From where you're standing, the lab researching how to physically open the pod is located on the left all the way to the back, and the lab researching the command signal can be found on the far right. These may be reached in whichever order you see fit, though the upcoming sections assume that you first head left.
Tactical Notes: Deciding which laboratory to visit first offers intriguing tactical variations for the player. Though you will face the same number of fights either way, heading left tends to result in clear lines of sight between your position and the enemy Turrets; this is favorable if you prefer taking out Turrets first, and/or if you have Sabotage to subvert them to your side. Heading to the right first will have you encountering Turrets that are initially blocked from being able to fire on you; you can use this to your advantage if your preferred tactics emphasize taking out the human enemies before engaging the tougher Turrets. Finally, if you manage through guile to reach the lab computer consoles without killing all the enemies, they will vanish during the cutscenes, bypassing the rest of the fight.
Obtain Pod Opening Instructions[]
...Just ashes of the Protheans long dead
Proceed forward and enter building 5 on the left. The second piece of Cerberus intel will be on a terminal inside, along with equipment to salvage (+3000 Credits). Then move to the building slightly down the hill, still on the left side. In the courtyard beyond it you will encounter several Combat Engineers, Assault Troopers, and Centurions. Their Turret is already set up, so approach with caution.
Go up the ladder to the top of the building for a good fighting position. Eliminate the enemies, go back down, and be sure to salvage the equipment (+6000 Credits), as well as pick up the third piece of Cerberus intel from the terminal and open a Med Kit (+300 XP) in the same building through the door on the countertop (very hard to see). Liara will mark a Nav-Point on your heads-up display, telling you that Cerberus was studying footage of the Protheans to figure out how to open the pod. Bypass the door, move through the building and open a Med Kit (+300 XP) outside on the balcony under the table. Enter the lab and use the computer console.
Shepard's eyes glow green as a cutscene of a Reaper attack unfolds. Prothean soldiers are fighting off a wave of Collectors outside a heavily-damaged bunker. As the soldiers retreat, a VI, Victory, is ordered by one of the soldiers to seal the bulkhead doors. Inside the facility, the VI reports that the Reapers have destroyed approximately 300,000 lifepods. The soldier taps the GUI of a nearby pod and observes a moment of silence for its dead occupant. The fighting doesn't let up as Victory alerts the soldier to the failure of the bunker's northern bulkheads. The soldier orders all forces to the north, and the scene concludes. In the present, Shepard learns how to duplicate the method used to open the Prothean lifepod (+500 XP). Liara expresses surprise that Shepard was able to understand what was being displayed, claiming that all she saw was static, but she quickly surmises that the knowledge of Prothean culture Shepard gained from the Cipher on Feros allowed the Commander to translate the images. If playing a non-imported game, Liara doesn't mention the Cipher, instead crediting the original Prothean beacon on Eden Prime for attuning Shepard's mind.
Obtain Command Signal[]
Sports can kill
Move outside, go left and up the stairs, across the courtyard, and up the second set of stairs to building 22. Inside, you'll find corpses, including four in a living room area. Examining the coffee table causes Commander Shepard to remark that they were killed while ""watching the game."" Be careful as you open the far door as the Cerberus troops beyond it already have a Turret set up.
Eliminate the hostiles, and from the room with the table, go across the courtyard and up the stairs, following the Pod Data Nav-Point to building 6 marked as a lab. Salvage the equipment on the left desk (+3000 Credits). Open the door and use the computer console for another flashback to 50,000 years past.
Two Protheans - a civilian and a soldier - are walking in a massive bunker complex. The civilian laments that he never thought the Empire would fall. The Prothean soldier assures the civilian of the Empire's rebirth and tells him to go to his stasis pod. Victory is then ordered to broadcast the stasis readiness signal to all pods, despite the existence of refugees who have yet to reach the bunker. The Prothean states that their sacrifice will be honored in the coming Empire. An explosion rocks the far end of the bunker, and the Prothean readies his rifle as more Collectors approach, before the scene once again fragments into jumbled memories. In the present, Shepard obtains the command signal to end the pod's stasis mode (+500 XP).
Return to the Pod[]
Standard Cerberus troop deployment
When you proceed outside you will see two Cerberus shuttles race overhead. Four Assault Troopers and two Combat Engineers will drop out before you can make your way outside the building.
Eliminate the hostiles and move towards the building with the door on the left. Note:  On higher difficulty levels, an additional pair of Guardians will appear as you advance. If you retrieved the command signal before the instructions to physically open the pod, then instead of Guardians, you will find a Combat Engineer, an Assault Trooper, and another Turret.
Go through the door and three Turrets, three Guardians, one Combat Engineer and an Assault Trooper will be waiting. Going through the open ground route to the door's right to try to flank them is tactically disadvantageous as it has very poor lines of sight to the hostiles and the Turrets are likely to strip your shields or even kill you before you can attempt to lure the organic enemies close. It's simply more prudent to take cover inside the structure and whittle the enemy down one by one. Tip: If you have Sabotage available, using it on the Turrets will cause them to helpfully mow down nearby friends.
Warning: On higher difficulties, be sure to approach the area where the Turrets are VERY carefully (especially if you aren't sure where it is precisely), as it is very easy to come up a staircase or out a door and be instantly gunned down by them. If you retrieved the command signal first, you'll want to take cover on the staircase railing and slide carefully up it.
Easy pickings
Alternatively, instead of going Rambo through the door you can simply lure the entrenched hostiles out by taking potshots at any nearby enemy while taking care to remain beyond the Turrets' firing range. Open the door, fall back as far as possible while eyeballing the hostiles, equip your most accurate long-range weapons, and take shots.
The organic enemies may be suckered in, and once that happens and they're in your preferred killing spot (or are far enough from the Turrets) feel free to let loose with the full fury of your abilities. If not, one enemy killed from afar is one less to worry about. Once all hostiles are terminated, proceed to their former location and destroy any Turrets that may have been missed, which should be a lot easier now.
Liara will tell you that they have retracted the bridge and to find another way across. Warning: Once you have made your way across you cannot go back, so make sure to first scour the area for any salvage or intel you might have missed and to reload your ammo. To cross, jump down and move to the left. You will see two ladders: scale them. Once on top of the building where you found the first intel terminal, move forward and vault over the two ventilation ducts, then make a right. Climb down the ladder and make your way to the Prothean pod. Using it will cause Shepard to transmit the command signal to the pod. Liara will state that it will take a few moments for the pod to process it.
Defend the Pod[]
Always the big guns only when all else fails
Several hostiles will launch an assault on your position from the direction you came from at the start of the mission, and two additional shuttles of Cerberus troops will appear. Defend your position or take cover in the nearby building, and eliminate all hostiles. Once all enemies have been dealt with, proceed inside the building to stock up on ammunition, if you need it, and then prepare for another wave. An Atlas will land between the building and the pod, and additional shuttles filled with Cerberus troops will arrive: the first appears near the Atlas, and the second attempts to flank the building by dropping near where you began the mission. The building will provide excellent cover from the Atlas. Bring it down with whatever means you have at your disposal, along with any footsoldiers in the way.
An alternative approach makes this fight a cakewalk. After activating the pod, quickly climb onto the roof of the building you were on top of earlier. The Cerberus troops will (mostly) not follow you and the Atlas can easily be worn down from your elevated position. It will move towards the building, and as it gets closer it cannot target you anymore. Repeated Tech or Biotic Explosions centered on the Atlas (even though the powers might show ""red"" on the Power Wheel) will annihilate most of the Cerberus squad as well as the Atlas with little danger to Shepard.
This planet was colored sepia in my cycle
Note:  The Atlas is hijackable if you want to attain the Hijacker Achievement. Proceed to shoot only the vehicle's cockpit until it cracks open, then shoot the pilot. You can then mount it and mop up any remaining Cerberus troops. Be aware that Cerberus troops may try to mount the vacant Atlas mech themselves, so be prepared to rush to it.
Once all troops have been eliminated, open the pod and speak to the Prothean within. You will converse with him both on the planet and back on the Normandy, after which he will introduce himself as Javik."

Upon heading towards the first nav-point, you will enter Building 52. To the right next to the sink will be a PDA to examine. Continuing through the latrine and into the bedroom, you will find a bunk bed with a dead civilian. Spare Parts worth 2,500 credits are located on the floor.
Secure upper streets[]
A civilian will run through the entrance and be gunned down by Cerberus. Engage Cerberus and take them out. There will be a single wave of Assault Troopers, supported by a Combat Engineer and a Centurion. Once all hostiles have been eliminated, the mission will update and provide you with a second objective.
Warning:  There will be a Turret already set up in the area so approach with caution and take it out from a safe distance.
Legendary Edition:  There is no pre-built Turret at this location, but the Engineer will soon start setting one up, so take him out before he can.
From the building with the bunk beds where you found the dead civilian, head towards Building 27. As you make your way to Building 27, Building 22 will be to the right. On the ground next to a pillar close to Building 22 will be the Dog Tag belonging to Alliance Soldier Bilal Osoba. The Dog Tag is required to complete the side mission Benning: Evidence.
Note:  If you miss the Dog Tag on Benning you can purchase it from the Spectre Requisitions store in the Spectre Office in the Citadel Embassies for 1,000 credits and present them to Osoba to complete the mission.
In the same courtyard, you will find Building 97. Under the painted number ""97"" is a black and yellow dumpster. To the right of the dumpster on the ground you will find the Capacitor Helmet. Enter Building 27 nearby. You will find a med-station, and Spare Parts worth 2,500 credits on the bridge between Building 27 and Building 25.
At this point you will hear or see Cerberus troops attacking a group of civilians on the streets below. Clear out the area of hostiles. As you make your way to speak to the civilians, you will be near Building 7 which contains a computer console with an email warning civilians to not trust Cerberus. Left from the middle stairs leading from Building 7 there is a small alley. There you will find Spare Parts worth 2,500 credits next to a machine labelled ""M382"".
Defend Civilians[]
Upon talking to the civilians, your goal now is to defend them as they move towards the landing pad for extraction. Initially the civilians will stay where you found them but then move onto the battlefield. Luckily, the civilians are impervious to damage and you can safely ignore them for the rest of the fight, though their occasional sprints forward toward the shuttle pickup point will serve to mark your progress. Before talking to them, it's a good idea to mark the location of ammo/grenade and medi-gel refills should you need them during the upcoming battle.
Combat Strategy: If you're looking for a good spot to defend, return to Building 7. It's the building nearest to the spot you found the civilians and the one with the Computer Console message telling you to ""Run!"". Building 7 offers a good view of the courtyard and plenty of room to dive away from grenades without exposing yourself too much. You will need to keep an eye on the two side entrances, since an occasional enemy will head around that way, but the narrow approaches in those directions will tend to bottleneck the enemy advance and you won't likely be seriously flanked, especially if you stay to the right closer to Building 5 to cover it while leaving your squad inside 7 with a clear view of the central approach.
Tip: Biotics generally and the Lash power in particular can be used with great effect for pulling enemies out of cover and even throwing them off the edge of the map. You encounter no enemies with armor on this mission except the odd Turret, and as such the shield penetration upgrade of Lash will allow you to use it against all enemies, even Centurions and Engineers.
The Cerberus troops will ignore the civilians and focus on you. There are several waves of enemies: the first waves consist of Assault Troopers (and a Centurion or two on Insanity level), and towards the end a mix of Assault Troopers, Combat Engineers, and Centurions. During battle, watch your flanks as Cerberus troops will climb ladders to gain height advantage or come through buildings around the sides.

Once you have eliminated all Cerberus troops, Shepard will declare an ""All Clear"" and the civilians will head to the landing zone and wait there. You can now safely pick up any remaining credits, upgrades, etc. from around the level.
Warning:  If Shepard does not declare an all clear, there is at least one active enemy remaining, and it might be a Turret, which the Engineers that appear towards the end tend to leave near your landing zone, sometimes concealed on low ground as you approach. Unattended Turrets with no other enemies around will eventually self-destruct if they aren't actively being engaged (you might hear the explosions).
On the way back to the landing zone, you will pass Building 5 where you will find a med-station. There are also Spare Parts under the counter for 2500 credits, and a PDA to examine next to the sink.
The mission does not end until you select the shuttle to leave, so feel free to complete this mission at your own pace."

If I may inquire...
From: Rutaana

Commander:

I have nothing but respect for your military service, but not all of my associates share this view. They have heard rumors you worked with Cerberus, and their disappointment is intense. I've seen some of them almost visibly frown.

I have confidence this is a scandal with no truth to it. Maybe if you fought Cerberus publicly, my friends and millions like them would be won back. Seeing them believe in their hero again would be worth it. But I wouldn't want you to get hurt fighting them just for me. Could I persuade you and your Alliance soldier friends to enter the Armax combat simulator to beat the simulated Cerberus there?

Sincerely,
Rutaana","At the Combat Simulator Control terminal select Cerberus as the enemy. Choose either no squadmates, James only, or James + Kaidan/Ashley (if the Virmire survivor is alive and available) as your squadmates—no other team members qualify as the specified ""Alliance soldier friends""—and complete the combat simulation. Other modifiers are allowed per your choice. Since most challenges are not mutually exclusive, you could conceivably finish other arena challenges at the same time, e.g. Citadel Arena: Medi-Gel Challenge or Citadel Arena: Spin Zone Elite Challenge.

I saw your match. It was just what my friends needed to see. A few of them complained that because the simulator wasn't real Cerberus, it meant less, but they were ridiculed by my other friends who knew your role in stopping the Citadel coup. I think I'm going to go watch the match again. Good luck, and thank you, Commander.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel_Docks:_Retake_the_Normandy,"Prerequisite: Citadel Archives: Escape
This mission is automatically acquired shortly after being released from the Citadel Archives trap.","Get to the Normandy[]
Ain't the ship beautiful. Also, zoom in for the mod locations.
During the ride to the docks, EDI, if she was chosen to be in your squad, will suddenly start to malfunction and then goes offline.  Don't worry, because she'll reactivate momentarily, though her visor is gone. She explains that the clone has blocked her connection to the Normandy and she cannot prevent it from taking control of the ship.
Joker gets Shepard and the squad as close as possible before the Citadel’s auto targeting system brings them down. Once you arrive, you can use your elevated position to take out the small initial group of enemies. Then, head down the ladder to the right and find cover quickly as a much larger wave of CAT6 enemies, including both Heavies and Snipers, will spawn, some quite near to your position. Take them all out before advancing.
Two more large groups of enemies trigger as you advance across this platform toward the Normandy, and if you've advanced too far they may even appear at your flanks, so move up slowly and carefully. You can help avoid getting flanked by returning to earlier positions as each new group spawns. Alternatively, if you have the means (Biotic Charge, Tactical Cloak, Adrenaline Rush, etc) or the opportunity to do so, just rush past them.
When you reach the other end, take the medical station and the Sniper Rifle Ultralight Materials, and head down the ladder. The Normandy is prepping for a quick takeoff and apparently planning to skip the half-hour preflight checklist, but only a single wave of enemies awaits you in the next area, and they're all standard Specialists. Once all enemies are down, grab the Shotgun Ultralight Materials mod and a med kit and head up the ramp and into the Normandy.
Boarding the Normandy[]
It fights plaque and hacks spaceships
On the ramp, you will find Traynor, furious because she was fired and discharged by the clone (whom she thinks was you) for alleged conduct unbecoming. The clone kicked her off the ship with barely enough time to grab her toothbrush. Shepard convinces Traynor that the clone was not the real Shepard (possibly with a kiss as a Paragon interrupt, if Shepard is female and Traynor is romanced). Your squadmates will head into the airlock to get the door, but it is sealed. Shepard asks Traynor if there is any other way in, and she notes that there is an emergency hatch in the airlock, but that it was designed to only open from the inside. As Shepard and the squad try and figure out how to get in without tools, Traynor meaningfully holds up her toothbrush (it uses tiny mass effect fields to remove plaque and massage the gums).
Soon after the squad boards, the Normandy jets away from the Citadel, and the clone with the CAT6 mercs is shown in the CIC. The crew has shut down a lot of systems, including EDI, but they did register a security breach before launch. Brooks and the clone head down to the armory while ordering the rest to slow you down.
Stop the Clone[]
One classy location for a fight
Crawl to the end of the passage and hit the switch for the stairs, but be ready as you'll immediately be in the thick of it. Though it appears that you start in the open against two Specialists and a Heavy at point blank range, there is a very tiny piece of cover on the left just at the top of the staircase, so run up and quickly take shelter.
There are plenty of enemies in CIC, and more will spawn from the other end by the security scanner leading to the War Room, including another Heavy and a Sniper. There is precious little cover, and plenty of enemies here so take them out quickly. Target Specialists first as their grenades will quickly force you out of the little cover there is; the Heavy is also capable of stunning you with its shield slam at close range. Banter about having a firefight in the CIC will ensue, depending on which squadmates you brought: apparently everyone has been dying to have a firefight here.
""Please send this to an animal shelter for proper disposal as a warship is not an appropriate..."" Oh, that is not okay!
Once you are done, head into the access room to the War Room to get Private Campbell’s favorite mug, an Assault Rifle Thermal Scope mod, and a merc PDA with a story of someone shooting their own foot off. When you are done, head over to the galaxy map and pick up the merc payment worth 15,000 credits.
Before you head to the elevator, you will discover that ""somebody"" dumped all of the personal effects from your cabin, including your Model Ships, pets, and medals, into a large bin with orders to dispose of everything. Shepard will have something to say about that—several things if you're persistent. You can also hear the head screaming from Bryson's experiment, if it was in Shepard's quarters.
Once you've had enough, head down the elevator. Depending on who is in your squad, you'll hear some final comments from them during the ride down. Hit the button to exit the elevator and begin the final showdown.
Finish the Clone[]
For some reason the cargo bay is crammed with boxes of medi-gel and thermal clips
Once inside the Cargo Bay, the clone emerges in a full set of N7 Armor, striped blue or red depending on whether your own armor is a full-body set (Collector Armor, etc) or if your pattern scheme is of either opposing color. The real Shepard takes offense at this and opens fire, which the clone evades while returning the favor. When Shepard taunts the clone, there will be a Renegade  interrupt where the clone tries to sneak up on the real one with a class-specific attack: Vanguard and Adept clones try a surprise biotic attack while the other classes try stabbing with an omni-blade. Regardless of whether the interrupt is taken or not, the real Shepard successfully defends the attack, at which point Brooks summons ""Hatchet Squad"" to the shuttle bay as reinforcements. The final battle between the Shepards begins.
At first, keep to the cover around the elevator. There are lots of different places to hide in the cargo bay, including depressions in the floor of the deck. One of the best initial cover locations is off to the far left behind some of the taller crates. The clone can throw grenades including a special grenade that leaves a lasting burning effect on the ground which denies that area from being used as cover, but it often can't manage to throw that grenade over the tall crates to the left.
In the upper right corner of the screen is a count of the clone's medi-gel (Legendary Edition:  there is no medi-gel counter visible). You will have to force the clone down to two to end the first stage of the fight, and then force it down to zero before you can win the second and final stage. The clone is quite aggressive especially in the first stage and it will try to get up close and personal. Brooks on the other hand tends to hang back and snipes with an N7 Crusader which can down your shields in one shot. She can use Tactical Cloak as well and does so when she takes heavy damage in the first part of the fight. The clone itself has weapons and abilities that vary depending on the real Shepard's class. For more information on this as well as specific tactics on dealing with the clone, see its own page.
Brooks, the clone, and any CAT6 Snipers in the area can all do very high damage and if they all get a bead on you, you can die in the blink of an eye on higher difficulties, so the safest strategy is to stay behind cover and focus on anything that advances on your position (which is usually the clone). This keeps the battle simpler and minimizes the risk of getting flanked. CAT6 mercenaries regularly replace the ranks of the fallen, so don't get hung up on trying to eliminate lesser enemies and keep your attention on the clone whenever possible as it can otherwise sneak up on you.
The clone sends everyone it has to the fight... One at a time
There is a large crate containing an unlimited supply of medi-gel in the center of the hold should you run out of it yourself, and another near the shuttle bay doors at the far end. With an unlimited supply available, you should use medi-gel freely every time a squadmate goes down and any time your health gets damaged below full. There are also 3-4 boxes with thermal clips and grenade refills scattered throughout; one can be found near each of the two weapon benches near your starting position.
When the clone gets down to its last two medi-gel, you will get a cutscene of Cortez (and a backseat-driving Joker) flying a skycar in front of the Normandy, preventing it from plotting a course and jumping to FTL, and sending it on wild maneuvers as the CAT6 pilot tries to get past them. The clone orders the pilot to shoot them down, but that proves to be easier said than done. A frustrated Joker offers to take over piloting duties, but Cortez declines. On the clone's orders, the Normandy's shuttle then launches to chase the skycar away, leaving the bay doors open. At this point the game will create an autosave point (if enabled).
The fight continues, but now the whole ship is banking sharply back and forth, which will substantially impair your ability to aim sensitive weapons such as sniper rifles. On the plus side, the clone becomes noticeably less aggressive from this point onwards and will actually start retreating back towards the open shuttle bay doors along with Brooks. Move up carefully with your squad, stay in cover, and pour on the pressure.
Once you get the clone to exhaust its last medi-gel and get its shield down one last time, the final cutscene will play. Both Shepards begin to brawl at the mouth of the open shuttle bay where they disarm each other and exchange blows. The ship swerves, resulting in each combatant being left dangling precariously over the edge of the open bay door. The clone then demands to know what makes Shepard so special; as if on cue the loyal squad arrives to pull the true Commander to safety. The clone looks to Brooks, who only returns a regretful glance and turns away. A squadmate then asks what should be done with your rival. You can offer a hand to save the clone, or unceremoniously kick it off your ship. If you choose the merciful option, the clone, realizing the futility of continued existence, lets go and falls to its timely demise.
But she's only a field agent!
After the Normandy is brought under control, Cortez and Joker assess the damage. You have one last chat with Brooks, who is already thinking of escape—a Paragon dialogue followed by a Paragon interrupt will lead to Shepard talking Brooks out of hacking the cuffs and giving herself up; a Renegade dialogue will result in Brooks hacking her cuffs and making a run for it, leading to a Renegade interrupt that allows Shepard to put a bullet in her back. In either path, if the interrupt is not taken, one of your squadmates will finish her off with a bullet and a few choice words. After that, the Normandy returns to dock. Upon their return, Shepard's two teammates make some ironic remarks about the way their shore leave ended up going—Shepard promises they'll finally be able to take some actual time off now.
Back at the apartment, Joker (and Wrex, if he is present) takes the Commander at their word and begins making plans for a party. Before Shepard can even respond yay or nay, Joker has invited Traynor, EDI, and Cortez, who all accept; Glyph notifies Liara about the party; and Cortez invites James as his plus one. Realizing that saying no is futile at this point, Shepard still insists on final say over the rest of the guest list, and demands time to explore the rest of the Strip. On regaining control, you may now do just that—or begin party planning straight away."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Priority:_The_Citadel_III,"Prerequisite: Priority: Rannoch
You automatically acquire this mission after liberating Rannoch from the Reapers.
The asari councilor will contact Shepard on the vid-com immediately upon return to the Normandy, telling them that she has vital information that must be shared in person.","This is a simple conversation-only mission. To begin the mission, travel back to the Citadel. Once you have arrived, travel to the Citadel Embassies and make your way to the late Councilor Udina's office. Enter to trigger a cutscene. The asari Councilor will tell you that the Asari Republic has taken a turn for the worse, and will proceed to tell you that a Prothean artifact is hidden in the Temple of Athame on the asari homeworld, Thessia. Once you have been dismissed, the mission will end and you will acquire the mission Priority: Thessia.
Wrex dies fighting for his people in one of the consequences of your actions
The mission is considered finished after talking with the Councilor. However, if you sabotaged the genophage cure and if Urdnot Wrex leads the krogan, he will be waiting for you at Normandy Dock: Bay D24 with a recording of your conversation with Dalatrass Linron. Enraged at this betrayal, he tries to kill Shepard. He cannot be reasoned with regardless of your choice of words.
There are two Renegade interrupts that will allow you to shoot him, but in both cases Bailey and C-Sec will take him down if you decline.
Bypassing Wrex[]
Because the three singleplayer DLCs (Mass Effect 3: Leviathan, Mass Effect 3: Omega, Mass Effect 3: Citadel) added rapid transport terminals throughout the Citadel, it is now possible to sabotage the cure, obtain salarian support and keep Wrex alive until the end of the game. This was probably an unintended consequence of using them since story sequence breaks in at least one other scenario: choosing whether the Virmire survivor stays with you or goes with Hackett.
The drawback is that you'll never be able to return to the Citadel all the way to the point the Reapers commandeer the station after Priority: Cerberus Headquarters for fetch missions or whatever business you might have there but this can be mitigated by careful mission planning and execution.
You sabotaged the genophage cure, killed the salarian scientist in the way and Wrex is the krogan leader. Proceed normally.
You've just finished Priority: Rannoch. Do every Search and Rescue operation and any other mission available up to this point if you want.
Go meet the asari councilor for Priority: The Citadel III, this mission. Complete every mission on the Citadel as the opportunities to do so are very limited if you don't want Wrex to die.
Have a Citadel mission available that deposits you straight to the Normandy after completion. Instead of taking the rapid transport to the Normandy or going back there through the Docking Bay (in which Wrex will appear out of nowhere to get killed), do that mission instead and at its conclusion head straight back to the Normandy (if a choice presents itself). You will bypass the entire encounter with Wrex on the Docking Bay and this is potentially repeatable so long as you have one such mission: Citadel: Leviathan I, Citadel: Leviathan II, or Citadel: Leviathan III.
You can return to the Citadel up until before Priority: Cerberus Headquarters where the station becomes unavailable afterwards. Just make sure to have enough missions available to keep the confrontation from happening. Expect to see Wrex in the ruins of London as if he, like his brother Wreav, never realized the cure was fake."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Rannoch:_Geth_Fighter_Squadrons,"Prerequisite: Priority: Geth Dreadnought
Legion/Geth VI informs Commander Shepard of the server's location during the dreadnought after-mission debrief.","To start this mission, orbit the planet Rannoch and select Geth Comm Hub. You will be treated to a long scene of the shuttle ride to the geth server hub where you can interject with your opinions on the issue. Morality points can be earned at this juncture even before commencing the mission proper, which starts with you stepping into an interface pod that will allow you to visit the geth on their home turf. Said interface pod is the result of the geth making improvements to organic-synthetic interfaces; Project Overlord is namedropped, and if you did the DLC in Mass Effect 2 your involvement as well. Legion/Geth VI tags along, mainly to distract the geth while you do the heavy lifting.
After the cutscene, you will exit the interface pod's virtual equivalent to find yourself inside the Geth Consensus. You will have no shields during your stay, but don't be alarmed as they're useless here anyway. Virtual planks appear beneath your feet to carve out a path, meaning you will always have ground to step on even if you're sprinting as long as you're going the right way. It is also impossible to fall off them. As you move forward you will find Reaper code infections, shown as yellow-orange tendrils, obstructing you and preventing new planks from forming. This will make the steps that they're supposed to continue from glow red.
So that's what the gun is for
To proceed, you must destroy the tendrils using the Geth Combat Software - your ""gun"". It regenerates ""ammo"" so you won't have to worry on running out. The tendrils can only be destroyed on their weak points, which glow orange, as the gun has no effect elsewhere. Your powers also have no effect on them. You don't need to eradicate the tendrils all the way to the walls, merely clearing enough for the platform paths to appear is sufficient.
Disrupt the obstructing infections as you make your way to the first access point. Enter the first access point, and in a flash of light you will be transported to the next portion of the Geth Consensus. You will be told that your access is denied and you must investigate further.
After exiting the access point, you are notified of data-clusters containing infected code which you need to disrupt to gain access. Shoot your way through the first barrier showing up, then search the tendril to your left; a small collection of orange data fragments floating around the solid code contains a Reaper Code Fragment which you can retrieve and give to an asari looking for it on the Citadel. The data tendril cannot be destroyed, nor can the data fragments, however it can be interacted with (like a terminal or datapad) so you can get it. It is very easy to miss.
Geth don't have crappy antivirus capabilities, they just accessed way too many ads and popups
Proceed to disrupt the infection of the data-clusters which takes the form of a large sphere. When clearing data-clusters, you don't need to eradicate the tendril infection connecting it to the walls, but you do need to clear the infection on the sphere, at three contact points. Successful eradication of a contact point will be followed by a distinctive audio cue. There are three data-clusters in the area, but to proceed to the next one you need to clear the first.
Once you liberate the first data-cluster, the infection enveloping the sphere disappears and a historical video will be played (on the PC you may need to hit 'V' to make the video play). This tells you of the origins of the geth, both the word and the synthetics. Playing the video is optional, but it will give you the intel for Improved Geth Resistors. Shepard asks why the quarians are shown masked in the historical footage, and Legion in turn asks how many quarians you've seen unmasked. If Tali was romanced in Mass Effect 2, Shepard says he only ever saw one, to which Legion replies that Shepard's perception does not match the historical data. Warning:  Proceeding to the next data-cluster without playing the video may forfeit your right to play it, costing you the dialogue. The intel, however, can still be picked up on the second data-cluster.
The price for collecting seven zettabytes' worth of porn is extensive indoctrination
A new path will be revealed which leads to the next data-cluster. As before, repeat the disruption process and another optional video is revealed after you are done clearing the infection. It's about the geth resisting shutdown commands, beginning to disobey their creators. Finally, proceed to the third data-cluster, but just sit back and watch the video since this data-cluster is uninfected. This time the geth are being massacred, until one picks up a weapon to defend itself and its fellow geth. Once the video ends, enter the access point revealed in front of you.
As the scene switches over to reality, a short cutscene shows one of your team members is being contacted by Admiral Raan, notifying that half of the geth fighters in pursuit stopped functioning, most likely due to the actions you've taken.
Back in the virtual world, you are informed that the Reaper code has adapted and can now self-replicate. If you attempt to disrupt the infection in front of you, it will restore itself. Thus, you need to search along the code trail and target its vulnerable point which is just above you. Disrupt the infection to continue.
Unlike the preceding infected data-clusters, you will need to cut off the tendrils at their distant weakpoints BEFORE attacking the sphere contact points
As you proceed further, you will find another data-cluster. Similarly, you need to search for a vulnerability along the infection trails before you can disrupt the self-replicating code. Once you have cleared all infections, the data cluster reveals another video recording: quarians who sympathize with the geth, and jailed by their peers for doing so. Watching this video gives you the Miniaturized Armor Capacitors Intel.
Proceed to the next data-cluster and repeat the same process; the only difference here is the self-replicating code has either one or two vulnerable points. Search for them thoroughly. Again, a video data will be played after clearing the infection: martial law on quarian worlds, and the eventual elimination of the geth's quarian supporters.
The last data-cluster is uninfected and shows the quarian exodus at the end of the Morning War. The geth did not pursue: the exact reasons have subtle distinctions depending on whether you're talking to Legion or the Geth VI. If Legion was activated in Mass Effect 2, another video data depicts Shepard's first encounter with Legion. This scene will not occur if the Geth VI is present. The access point will be activated after the end of this sequence.
When you proceed to the access point, you will be shown another cutscene showing the rest of the geth squadron have ceased functioning. Instead of directly bringing you back to the real world, you emerge a few meters away from the real exit, so go there; Legion/Geth VI tells you there are no more geth in the server, but its connection is getting choppy. Once Shepard's back to reality, a dozen or so Geth Primes exit their pods as well, surrounding your squad. They do not attack, but volunteer to join you in the fight against the Reapers instead.
Completing this mission gives you 12,500 credits, adds Geth Prime Platoon to your War Assets, and fulfills an obligatory requirement for the geth-quarian peace process."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Cerberus_Automated_Turret_Schematics,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II
Prerequisite: Tuchanka: Bomb
Eavesdrop on the C-Sec Officer in the Presidium Commons after the attack on the Citadel. He is standing next to a volus on a balcony just outside of the vid-wall hallway, where two nurses discussing a traumatized asari used to perch before the attack. He mentions needing to deactivate Cerberus turrets that are threatening civilians.
Alternatively, the mission can be triggered by acquiring the Turret Control Schematics during the bomb defusal mission on Tuchanka.","The C-Sec Officer is available only after the attack on the Citadel, although it is possible to obtain the schematics first.
Turret schematics in the laptop next to the one with the glowing screen
Retrieve the turret schematics from some crates where a couple of Assault Troopers are running away instead of facing you and a Combat Engineer sets up a turret. It's after the large open area where you and your squad get their first good look at the turian bomb. Take the schematics before meeting with Lt. Victus as the next area is a point of no return.
If you did not retrieve the schematics during the mission, you can purchase them at the Spectre Requisitions terminal in the Citadel Embassies for 1,000 credits.
When you hand over the schematics to the officer, you will be given 5 Reputation, 30 experience, and 1,000 credits. The Citadel Defense Force War Asset will be updated as well."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Tuchanka:_Bomb,"Prerequisite: Tuchanka: Turian Platoon
This mission is acquired automatically after meeting with the stranded turian platoon.
Warning: Once acquired, you have a limited window to accomplish this mission. If you complete any three other missions before doing this one, it will no longer be available and will be considered failed.","After being dropped in, head to cover immediately; Cerberus Assault Troopers and Centurions are waiting to greet you. In spite of the impressive Omaha-Beach-like bombardment, it is safe to ignore the incoming artillery fire and concentrate entirely on the Cerberus troops.
Fight your way through the Cerberus soldiers and explosions to the ruined building ahead. In addition to troopers standing practically right in front of you, more will appear from the rear, and will tend to concentrate around some generator-powered cover in the mid-section and then at another generator up on the high ground in the back. The guards at the high-ground cover can be quite tenacious, but once you reach the mid-section generator, if you immediately head to the far right side and take cover behind the long wall, you will be able to get a clear shot at the rear generator, both eliminating the cover and damaging the nearby enemies.
The fighting and explosions will stop, so go through the break in the wall and head up the ramp. About halfway up the ramp, to your left, you will find an M-29 Incisor, which is a sniper rifle that fires in three-round-bursts.
Proceed up the ramp and pick up the Shotgun Blade Attachment at the top. Once you round the corner, Cerberus troops, including Combat Engineers and Guardians, will attack from behind shield generators. Watch out for a Turret in the back, and when possible shoot out the generators and shield pylons that protect and reinforce the enemy. Remember that shooting a generator creates an overload that damages anything in the area.
After this area is secure, at the end of the hall in the cul-de-sac on the right, you will find the Rosenkov Materials Gauntlets.
As you head out of this area, don't miss a small laptop console on your right to salvage (5,000 credits). Climb up the rubble, and you will find an SMG Heat Sink in the corner ahead; Lt. Tarquin Victus notifies you about Cerberus putting up a fight, and you will find a med kit and Pistol Scope along the far wall in the next area.
Cerberus Evacuates[]
Usually they're jumping OUT of the shuttles, not IN
As you climb out of the building, two Cerberus troops are being evacuated; if you act quickly, you can kill them. Cross the bridge to where the troops were, and salvage the data pad (5,000 credits). As you turn the corner, there are more Cerberus Assault Troopers to deal with, but, as you make your way through them, more are being evacuated.
Make your way up the ramp, and take a look at the bomb site, and then head up the ladder to your right. Right ahead, against the wall, is a Sniper Rifle Concentration Mod. A little farther along, you will find a Pistol Melee Stunner. After you make your way down the ramp, you will see more Cerberus soldiers fleeing, but they will place a turret, so run to cover. On the left-hand side, before the turret location, you will find Turian Technology to salvage (2,500 credits). Pick up the med kit near the destroyed turret, and Turret Control Schematics partway up the crates. Continue around the corner and down the ladder to trigger a cutscene with Lt. Victus.
Defend Victus[]
Victus at the control panel
After the cutscene, you must defend Lieutenant Victus from Cerberus while he disables the bomb. There will be a few Cerberus troops on the ground, and then more will arrive by shuttle in groups of 4-5; while they're all grouped together just before or after a drop is a great time to hit them with Power Combos to produce explosions. Singularity or Stasis with the Bubble evolution can also be highly effective, as can grenades.
The first three shuttles contain a mix of Assault Troopers and Centurions. The primary complication during this phase is that the Cerberus forces will actively try to damage Victus, and you must not let his health drop to zero.
Then an Atlas drops in, followed by one last shuttle of Cerberus infantry. There is an M-560 Hydra rocket launcher in the right corner which can get rid of the Atlas pretty easily. Once all Cerberus forces have been dealt with, another cutscene shows Victus sacrificing himself to prevent the bomb from detonating, ending the mission."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Prologue:_Earth,You acquire this mission automatically at the beginning of the game.,"After customizing your character and a series of cutscenes and dialogue with opportunities for morality points, you enter the training stage of the prologue.
Anderson will give you an M-3 Predator.
The boy is real
Follow Anderson across the rooftops and obey the on-screen prompts. Note that not following the prompts as stated may result in subsequent events not triggering, so treat this mission like the tutorial that it is.
Some Oculi are flying overhead and make short work of Alliance fighters. Eventually, you reach a point where you see husks climbing up a far wall. Look to their right and you'll notice a child running towards the shelter of a building. Anderson shoots at the husks and he suggests you do the same. Obey him or not, your choice: he'll run out of ammo eventually and climb down the ladder to the right. At this point in the game, Anderson does no damage whatsoever even if it looks like he's shooting. Also, until you go down the ladder, you'll have infinite ammo, so use as many rounds as needed to get your aim straight.
Follow him down, and jump to the next building. Here, you will need to fight the husks in melee and/or with offensive powers if you have them. You'll lose ammo regardless of whether you fired your pistol or not. Once you have killed the last husk, the Reaper that looms above you during your escapade will fire its laser at the building directly adjacent to you.
PROTIP: follow the prompt and take cover because they keep coming in infinite waves if you don't
You can walk into the destroyed building after the ensuing short cutscene. Open the med kit (+300 XP) in the first room before you continue.
The next door holds a surprise (a stuck but grabby husk) and a cutscene with a chance for morality points. It's the boy from earlier, and whatever you decide for him, he'll be gone while you're distracted by Anderson's voice.
Reload your weapon after another lengthy cutscene, and continue along until you get to two Alliance soldiers. Along the way, you see an Alliance vessel getting obliterated by a Reaper and hear radio chatter from either Ashley or Kaidan about it. The shockwaves from its destruction will shake up the terrain, bringing you directly within range of the soldiers and preventing you from backtracking. They will tell you to be wary of enemies further ahead.
This will be your first engagement against Cannibals. Unlike in subsequent engagements with these creatures, they won't use grenades against you. Note that Anderson can deal damage now, and you can allocate any available squad points to his various abilities. Be sure to do this, it will make the coming fights easier. Take to cover and kill all hostiles before talking to the soldiers once more.
PROTIP: just shoot till you run out of ammo
Cross the bridge to salvage a second med kit (+150 XP). An Alliance gunship will fly over ahead, being chased by a Harvester. Fortunately, the Harvester will ignore you. Fight off the next wave of Cannibals around the corner. There's lots of cover here, so use it wisely. Continue ahead and pick up the M-8 Avenger right in front of the radio you were seeking. Activate the radio and fight off a third wave of Cannibals. After you run out of ammo or kill all the waves, the Normandy SR-2 will arrive and take out the remaining Cannibals.
Say goodbye to Anderson and then witness the boy you met earlier get killed as the Kodiak he boards to evacuate is shot down by a Destroyer. The Normandy leaves Vancouver behind and ascends, passing the burning remnants of once mighty human fleets, as you embark on your journey to save the galaxy.
Aboard the Normandy, James Vega is incredulous when he finds out you intend to follow Anderson's orders and leave Earth to seek aid from the Citadel Council. Respond to him however you choose, which can include a Paragon or Renegade interrupt to cut off his protests. Admiral Hackett then contacts you and gives you your next mission."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Priority:_Thessia,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel III
This mission is acquired automatically after speaking to the asari Councilor in the late Donnel Udina's office.","Husks at the Barricade[]
Free equipment and credits courtesy of some guys who are about to be overrun by biomechanical zombies
Your shuttle lands in a precarious safe zone barricaded by asari soldiers. There's an Umbra Visor and supplies worth 4,500 credits next to a nearby floodlight, away from Lieutenant Kurin. Take the items first before you do anything else, because speaking to Kurin will begin a lengthy semi-inescapable scene.
Your conversation with Kurin is interrupted by the Reapers demolishing the barricade. The lieutenant directs you to use a turret gun to the right of the hole while a soldier volunteer plugs the hole with her biotic barrier. Multiple Brutes appear, as well as Husks that will run towards the biotic barrier in an attempt to destroy it.
A Barrier Engine is located where the Brutes are spawning, and it will essentially double the enemies' ability to take damage until it is destroyed. There will be three groups of Brutes spawning at a distance, intermixed with waves of Husks jumping over the wall nearer at hand.
PROTIP: Barrier engine first, then whoever's hammering away at the barrier
Though deceptively similar to the earlier Husks-at-the-barricade incident on Menae, this encounter adds an urgency element in the form of the barricade's health bar. The simplest solution to this is to destroy the Barrier Engine first (you can actually see and destroy it before talking to Kurin), then prioritize anything standing next to the barricade, and then if you have time to pound down spawning Brutes before they get across the bridge then that's great. But don't leave a group of husks pounding on the barricade to engage Brutes that aren't: though you'll intuitively fear the Brutes more, objectively the Husks will do more damage during the time you're hitting the Brutes than a Brute getting a couple of slow hits in.
Keeping your gun mostly pointed at the barricade will make the most efficient use of your limited time and firepower. Don't worry about friendly fire; your shots won't damage the barrier. Despite the presence of squadmates and other soldiers, none of them actually help you out here (Note:  You can't even use squadmate powers) and it's solely up to you to clear the bridge. Finally, remember that the turret will turn much more quickly if you refrain from using the zoom-in-aim function.
Note:  It is possible but inefficient to not use the turret at all and simply kill all incoming enemies on foot on your own. Kurin nags you to use the turret, but eventually the spawns will cease all the same. If you haven't looted the outpost's items before speaking to Kurin, this is the last chance to do so while there's still some barrier remaining.
Route to Asari Temple[]
When the onslaught stops, Kurin directs her soldiers to repair the breach and announces she's pulling her forces out despite orders to hold the location, reluctant to waste any more lives. She has been told to expect Shepard and nothing else, and you can be as forthcoming or cagey with the details. In response, Kurin also reports that they lost contact with the scientists at the temple. Whichever the case Kurin eventually becomes convinced of your mission's importance and pledges her unit's support. At the conclusion of your talk you resume control just outside the barricade and you will receive morality points depending on your conduct with Kurin.
Expendable cannon fodder doing their best to gain a few more seconds of survival in the battlefield
Proceed across the bridge and listen to Liara being introspective. Shortly you will see a View prompt focusing on a gunship-harvester dogfight. See it or not, that's the cue for a group of Marauders and Cannibals to spawn at the far end of the bridge. Fortunately there's a lot of cover by the bridge's support studs so you don't have to soak up their firepower needlessly. The far side of the area looks like a dead end, but the path is visually blocked by a wall and the way forward is to turn right to a short corridor.
Go nuts with the coming skirmish: guns blazing, power spamming, or some combination of both
The rubble-strewn corridor opens up to a large rubble-strewn courtyard. You get another View prompt of Kurin's subordinates attempting to provide you fire support, but they are all slaughtered by a harvester that flies off. Meanwhile a more immediate danger is another Marauders-and-Cannibals sortie: 2 initial Cannibals eating a dead asari, and 2 separate initial Marauders. There's also a bunch of Spore Pods for that nasty swarmerless acid damage so watch your step.
Your next destination is beyond the active green door due northwest. As you traverse the courtyard more Cannibals emerge from the sky or the building to the north-northwest, and as you approach the door Marauders drop in, contingent on how many Cannibals have already been killed. The area has a lot of cover but still lends itself well to a running gunfight; feel free to let loose with mid- to long-range weapons and powers. When you're within striking distance of the door 2 Marauders arrive as prelude to a familiar bloodcurdling scream: a Banshee promptly destroys the door and joins the battle.
A sight for sore eyes
Fortunately, this mission grants you heavy weapons at strategic moments. Facing the door, to your left (or south by absolute positioning), below the giant curving support structure that also serves as a roof there's an M-560 Hydra missile launcher on the floor. Banshees go from full armor/barrier to melted or severely injured, depending on difficulty, your accuracy, and number of other enemies close by. It's only one shot, so make it count.
Tip: This one of two missions in the entire game with multiple Hydra pickups. If you wish to save the Hydra for later, simply carry it while out of combat, toss it to the ground to use your regular weapons, and pick it up again until such time you decide to deploy it.
When Shepard tells the squad to get moving before more Reapers come back, that's your cue to start looting before leaving the courtyard. There isn't much here: a bunch of thermal clips aside from enemy drops, and 2 Med Kits, one by the building door where Cannibals spawned and another one on the same side as the Hydra. Liara takes position in front of the doorway to the next area while your other squadmate urges haste as long as you haven't moved on yet.
The future of Thessia looks grim. And dark.
The area beyond the doorway is a short one-way drop so ensure you have no further business in the courtyard before proceeding. Just after that one-way drop is a Terminal on the floor (7,500 credits). Liara shares her reticence at facing Banshees and the other squadmate will have something to say about it as you move forward. After a couple of thermal clips on the ground, bypass the next door afterward. The bypass won't complete until the earlier dialogue has played out. When you emerge into the next area a View prompt will appear for a Reaper in the not-too-far distance as it slowly (and loudly) walks away from the scene. All of your squadmates (bar Liara, who points the Reaper out) express horror at the sight.
In the courtyard below you'll also see three Cannibals munching on some victims. They're busy so you have the element of surprise: with the right abilities, you can kill them without firing a shot. The ground shakes while the Reaper is still around, which can mess up your aim, though soon enough it stops as your squadmates will point out the Reaper is moving on. As you engage the Cannibals your squadmates also alert you to the presence of fire support in the form of asari snipers in the balcony at the far end, and if you approached the Cannibals without attacking the snipers will be the ones to trigger their fight response.
PROTIP: that big slab of debris is your way to the second floor, and the area is so dark you won't see the med-kit except for its GUI indicator.
Just to the right of the Cannibals (or east in absolute positioning) is a broken shotgun that can be salvaged for 3,000 credits. Easy to Miss: Directly above the broken shotgun on a small ledge (reached by climbing the debris outside the alcove with the shotgun) is a Med-kit, spare thermal clip, and Shotgun High Caliber Barrel.
As you approach the asari snipers a stray hit kills one of the two. Specialist Cayla, the surviving one, radios to report Specialist Jineva's demise. Kurin asks if Shepard's around, and Cayla's responses change depending if you reached her in time or not.
What immediately follows is an inbound wave of Marauders and Cannibals, supported by a Barrier Engine sticking out of the eastern wall; take that one out first. You're on a covered balcony, they're on lower ground, put two and two together and realize you're at a very advantageous spot. There are even Spore Pods you can pop to douse nearby husks in acid. When you've killed a few, a couple more hurtle from above. This is a good time to deploy the Hydra, if you saved it earlier. There's also a med-kit, Sniper Rifle Concentration Mod, spare thermal clips, and the M-98 Widow in the balcony, can't miss them.
Little incentive to go down there even if you're melee-oriented. Take the W and start shooting fish in a barrel.
Specialist Cayla provides a constant stream of commentary, e.g. ""You hit one!"", but not much in the way of useful fire support. She's invulnerable so you only have yourself and squadmates to worry about. Once the coast is clear, she signifies to stay behind and cover your rear while urging you to get going. Proceed to the lower area and collect thermal clips if necessary; there should be plenty. Liara advises escaping toward the Reaper and the other squadmate balks at calling it such. There's a hole in the eastern wall, proceed through and follow the path.
The first ledge after the hole is also a one-way drop, so make sure you sweeped the previous area first. While you're moving toward Outpost Tykis you get a clearer view of the Reaper that walked past you in the distance. Liara despairs at the never-ending nightmare. Shepard quips about waking up after finding the artifact, and the other squadmate also has some comments on that.
Outpost Tykis[]
For once you have gunships on your side, not in front of your guns
A cutscene starts when you reach Outpost Tykis. They're being overrun, and there's only one asari soldier left. With no options, you tell the soldier to call for air support, and two gunships answer. Talons One and Five initially mow down the invaders, but Talon One goes down to enemy fire and crashes nearby. A Banshee and another fresh horde of Reapers appear, then control shifts back to you.
After the cutscene, you gain 450 experience and morality points depending on how you phrased the suggestion for air support. Initial enemy headcount is a Banshee, a Barrier Engine, and 3 Marauders. You have fire support from the surviving soldier and Talon Five, who are invulnerable at this point, and the second (and final) M-560 Hydra is also here.
The gunship can spew missiles but they're almost useless unless you prioritize the barrier engine
Be careful of the Banshee as it can get ridiculously close within just a few seconds. For optimum Hydra use against the Banshee, retreat back the way you came and even further if necessary. If you haven't destroyed the Barrier Engine first, you might want to lure the Banshee away from it before loosing your one missile. If you still have the first Hydra, this is also a good place to deploy it, as you may need the second one shortly later.
When the Banshee dies a Ravager spawns up the slope from Outpost Tykis. This time you have the low ground disadvantage, but you have lots of cover. Note:  The Ravager fails to appear if you killed the Banshee while you're in the area where the Ravager is supposed to appear. Whichever the case, Talon Five's missiles are spent and she switches to guns only from hereon out. The surviving soldier stays behind to guard the rear.
Talon Five[]
Husks are consummate professionals; mass accelerator rounds in the ass are minor inconveniences routinely ignored
Continue on past Outpost Tykis, forward up the rubble and then to the right (or northeast). You're actually at the side of the asari temple already, you just need to go to the entrance at the far end. Next to the burning wreckage of Talon One, to your right, is an Assault Rifle Extended Barrel. Past it, Husks attack you; past them, you tangle with two Harvesters accompanied by Marauders, Ravagers, and a Barrier Engine (on Insanity difficulty a third Harvester shows up during the battle especially if you killed one of the initial two quickly). Another Harvester forces Talon Five to divert from air support for a while.
Stick to cover, take shots at them whenever you can and watch out for any Swarmers. Tip: After dealing with the Husks, don't rush forward: scope and shoot the Barrier Engine from a distance before the next group of enemies appears. If you're still lugging a Hydra Missile Launcher, note that it won't reach the Harvesters but can be used to clear out the ground forces. This is the final opportunity to use the Hydra responsibly since it is essentially useless later.
Two wormnecks! That's... almost impressive (third one is busy chasing Talon Five)
Consider falling back, which makes it easy to take out the Harvesters first, then get rid of the Marauders since they'll keep throwing up barriers and then get rid of the remaining enemies. Talon Five returns momentarily, but eventually a Harvester grabs her gunship and she goes down. Note:  You don't actually have to kill the Harvesters: once Talon Five is down, they will flee the battle. Harvesters' armor bar are only visible up close (which is essentially suicide for you), but they can be damaged or killed all the same and the armor bar returns when they start fleeing the scene. Lastly, there's also no conventional way to save Talon Five even if you quickly wiped out all enemy forces before you.
Push forward and you'll arrive at the shielded temple entrance. There's an SMG Heat Sink next to a thermal clip/grenade box, and on the opposite side the barrier controls for the shield. Liara handles the bypassing when you interact with it.
Temple of Athame[]
The statue of Athame
Make your way into the temple and pick up a med kit close to the entrance. No one's answering in the temple because they're dead: the scientists' bodies are lying on the ground near the large central statue, which is the artifact you're looking for. However, before investigating the statue, search the temple for other artifacts to learn about the asari's history. If Javik is with you, he elaborates upon their history, in more detail than Liara. Long story short, the Protheans meddled in asari prehistory, and Liara will have a hard time wrapping her head around it even in the face of mounting evidence. Note:  You only get the squadmates' comments on the artifacts prior to examining the central statue. Later you can interact with them again, but it's only in terms of whether they're relevant to the task at hand or not.
When you investigate the statue, your non-Liara squadmate examines the scientists and find their throats were slit, indicating non-Reaper hostiles. After concentrating on the statue, Shepard realizes there is a Prothean Beacon in the temple. This helps explain how the asari are so advanced since they had the chance to study the temple for thousands of years and kept it a secret from the other species.
The entrance barrier goes back up after you examine the statue, cutting you off from the previous areas. You have to examine (or re-examine) other artifacts to activate the beacon; they are marked by glowing blue flames surrounding their display cases. One is provided for you, the mural of Athame to the right of the statue (either you activate it yourself due to the Cipher or Javik does if he's around). The others you have to activate yourself, and they are:
The Athame Codex manuscript discussing biotics, to the far left of the statue
Janiri's bust, to the right of the statue
The shield of Athame, at the entrance of the temple
There's no time pressure. If you dither enough during the activation process the squad also have some comments on the revelations.
There's probably a less destructive way of accessing the beacon, only the guys who know about it are busy being dead
When all four are activated the statue disintegrates to reveal the beacon. Out of it comes a Prothean VI, Vendetta. It tells you the galactic extinction appears to be a recurring cycle, and the Crucible is a result of it merely passed down to the Protheans. It agrees to help your cause, but it detects someone who is indoctrinated and promptly hides back to the beacon. Kai Leng shows up, Shepard pegs him as the scientists' killer, and he delivers a hologram of the Illusive Man, who explains more about his goal to control the Reapers instead of destroying them.
Regardless of how the conversation goes, you'll have to fight Leng. Morality points are awarded depending on your responses to Vendetta and the Illusive Man.
Fight Kai Leng[]
Stay behind cover as Kai Leng sends shockwaves that disable your shields. Although Leng's health bar shows shields and armor, for this battle you're only concerned with depleting his shields. Once you take out about half of his shields a gunship will cover him while he recharges them, during which process you'll need to stay in cover lest you be machine-gunned down. This will repeat a couple times. When you finally get Leng's shields all the way down, a cutscene will resolve the rest of the battle.
Leng is unfortunately immune to singularities; best they can do is add swirling energy thingies to his drip
Combat Notes: You'll want to avoid letting him get close to you, moving if necessary, but if you hit him with everything your squad has got immediately, especially anti-shield abilities, this won't become an issue. If your squad can create a Tech Burst, it will finish most of his shields off right away, even on Insanity. Likewise, Lash with the shield-piercing evolution will allow you to throw Kai Leng around like a toy, essentially rendering the ""fight"" a joke (mind the unexpected physics bugs though, as you may get stuck). Just keep as much distance as possible and make sure to stay behind cover when the gunship starts shooting. If you still have the Hydra, it's only good for forcing Leng to recharge his shields once and not the one-hit KO you may be expecting it to be.
Once you deplete Leng's shields thrice he somehow overpowers your two squadmates and orders the gunship to destroy the temple, almost sending Shepard to the abyss. Leng saunters to the beacon, steals the VI, and walks out. Shepard climbs out of the hole too late as Leng is already airborne, and you're left to hear over comms Kurin and the other asari being overwhelmed by the Reapers."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Asari_Widow,"Prerequisite: Kallini: Ardat-Yakshi Monastery
You acquire this mission by investigating a PDA in an Ardat-Yakshi monastery. It is on the first chamber with an interior balcony that you reach from the beginning of the mission, where you will encounter Samara if she's alive.
Note:  Unlike most other item retrieval missions in the game, failure to obtain the PDA will permanently lock out this mission as no equivalent can be bought from Spectre Requisitions.","Do not forget to take back the datapad
Tashya Porae was badly wounded when she recorded her last message, which included some personal regrets. You can hear the message again for clarity after obtaining the mission.
When you return to the Citadel, go to Presidium Commons. Weshra, labeled as Asari Widow, is standing on the stairs between Meridian Place Market and Apollo's Cafe. On comms, she's unsuccessfully trying to get information on her bondmate's whereabouts or even assignment as it was classified. Talk to her to bring her the bad news and closure.
Note: The mission objective may not show up on the map. You are looking for an asari standing alone on the stairwell.
You will receive 90 experience and 5 Reputation for completing the mission."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Identity_Theft_I,"Prerequisite: Citadel Wards: Ambush
This mission is acquired immediately upon regaining control after escaping the ambush.","You arrive back at the Personal Apartment and a conversation immediately begins about what happened. Brooks can't believe that Shepard survived all of that. Shepard tries to contact Bailey but Brooks warns that doing so might make him a target. Shepard agrees and shuts down the comm link. Shepard then asks Brooks how they got involved in all of this and she explains how. She wrote a program to follow officer IDs and prevent fraud and it found someone hacking into Shepard's file. This identity thief went through Shepard's personal records, classified files, everything. Investigations need to start from somewhere, and the M-11 Suppressor Shepard recovered is chosen as the starting point.
Note:  Grumbling about your shore leave getting cancelled in this conversation can draw a sympathetic response from your love interest if they are present.
Bright-eyed, over-eager, limited field experience - Brooks or Liara from 2183?
Liara then examines the pistol and summons Glyph. Glyph begins compiling data and then Joker walks in with the rest of the crew.
At this point you can go around and talk to all crewmembers there. James, EDI and Cortez are the only other crewmates present in any playthrough; the rest (Javik, Garrus, Tali, and Ashley/Kaidan) are contingent on them being recruited and part of the Normandy squad already. Wrex is present but only if the genophage cure is real, not faked - If he came to your rescue in the previous mission, it probably is.
Joker, EDI, Cortez, Glyph, Brooks, James, Ashley/Kaidan, and Tali are on the main floor. Javik, Garrus, and Wrex are on the top floor. Several of the crew give you a hard time about destroying the floor of the sushi bar, while Joker is still miffed at having been used as a decoy.
You can also visit the weapon bench and armor locker on the second floor to change your loadouts if you desire. The M-11 Suppressor will be your only equipped weapon. However, don't worry too much as you'll have another opportunity to do this later on.
Schematics for Khan's hideout
You only need to talk to one person in the apartment. Once you do, a short timer kicks in before Liara announces she's ready to tell you what she discovered.
Liara says she called in some favors to get information on the gun, and it led to a casino owner named Elijah Khan, who is suspected of using his money to smuggle weapons onto the Citadel. She continues by playing a very interesting call that took place after the attempt on Shepard's life. Someone took pains to hide behind voice modulators, and it isn't Khan. You can ask about the Mercs, and they are from an organization called CAT6, which is slang for Alliance Dishonorable Discharges.
Silver Coast Casino - black tie required
The conversation turns to how to get Khan, and with the saferoom he has, it won't be easy. Liara comes up with a plan, which Shepard expands on to include a small team, no gunplay, and using stealth. Glyph cuts in to say Khan's using his Silver Coast Casino for a charity event for war refugees that evening.
The topic turns to how they will get into the panic room and how to disable the camera on the door. They all provide reasons why they wouldn't be able to assist...except for Brooks. Shepard then says that she is in, despite her objections. You can reassure her that she will be covered. Liara mentions one last hurdle: it is a black-tie event.

First, meet with Darner Vosque at Docks: Holding Area. Vosque tells you that he wants turian General Septimus Oraka, who is investigating his raids on C-Sec weapons, dead in order to secure his allegiance to Aria (as well as some of that ""blue ass"" to seal the deal). By speaking with Vosque you gain 2 Paragon or 2 Renegade points. Shepard calls Aria who explains that Shepard should talk to Oraka and get him to back off. Aria's dialogue nets you 2 Paragon or 2 Renegade points more.
Oraka has abandoned Chora's Den for the Courtyard area of the Presidium Commons. He tells you that he needs you to secure high-grade weapons if he is to lay off the Blue Suns, to prepare the Citadel for the eventual Reaper attack. He directs you to a salarian named Kannik further down in the Meridian Place Market, at Cipritine Armory.
You have a few options at this point, which yield morality points when the mission's done. Kannik is willing to deal, but only if you find rare artifacts to give to him. The artifact is in Kite's Nest on the planet Vana in the Vular system. Return the artifact to Kannik and you will receive a reward of 2 Paragon or 2 Renegade points, then talk to Oraka to complete the mission and get 5 Paragon points.

Dear Commander,

I hope you'll give me a minute of your time, because I'm not a fundraiser. I'm a parent. My daughter Lati was diagnosed with a cerebral tumor a year ago today. After endless tests, the doctors finally went in with microsurgery machines and removed the bad tissue. Her outlook is positive, but the recovery has been slow. She doesn't have full use of her limbs.

Lati wanted to be a huntress when she grew up, but she's afraid that the closest she will come is watching the games in the Citadel combat simulators. When she heard Commander Shepard was playing, she instantly knew what she wanted: to go to the Citadel and see you live. A small charity called Help a Dream brought her here, and now we want to make one small request: that you fight the toughest Reapers in the simulator and dedicate the match to Help a Dream.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Priority:_Sur%27Kesh,"Prerequisite: Priority: Palaven
This mission is acquired in the post-mortem briefing of the primarch retrieval mission.","Introduction[]
Go to the Annos Basin and dock with the Diplomatic Ships. Dalatrass Linron and the Urdnot Clan leader (Wrex if he survived Virmire, otherwise it will be Wreav) will come on board the Normandy, a neutral location, for the summit. The price for krogan aid on Palaven is a cure for the genophage, which has been discovered to now be within reach due to Maelon's research. A few krogan females survived Maelon's procedures, and the clan leader has proof that they are on Sur'Kesh. They must be retrieved.
On approach to the lush salarian homeworld
Upon arrival at the salarian base, you can talk to the Urdnot leader for more information. The console on the upper level near the shuttle can be repeatedly activated, prompting the exasperated soldier next to it to try to convince you to stop. If Captain Kirrahe survived Virmire, you can talk to him on the lower levels near the door; you'll find out he's been promoted to Major. If he's dead, he will be replaced by Lieutenant Tolan, who is more critical of Shepard's proposed strategy. There are several conversations that can be overheard between the salarians in the area. Lastly, there is a view point of the scenery near Padok Wiks where squadmates will offer their opinions on natural beauty.
When you are ready to move on, speak to Padok Wiks if you wish, and then proceed to the elevator. When you use the door, a cutscene will play. You will meet Mordin Solus (if he survived the assault on the Collector Base, or if you didn't import a save); otherwise, Padok Wiks will accompany you. Whichever character is present will admit to being Clan Urdnot's inside source, and will introduce you to the sole remaining survivor from among the krogan females brought to Sur'Kesh. The Urdnot leader will then alert you that Cerberus is attacking. You need to secure the release of the female.

Bottom level[]
In the back of the room near the emergency exit on the upper level is an Assault Rifle Extended Barrel. There are two research audio logs that discuss the backstory of the female krogan: One on the bottom section near the elevator, and one on the top between the emergency exit and the elevator. When you're finally ready to advance, use the elevator as instructed. However, there will be a bomb inside, and Shepard will have to use the ladder in the emergency exit to continue.
First level[]
Where the hell are my pants?
Note that despite the repeated warnings from your squad members, there is no penalty to moving slowly in this section of the mission. Open the door and head around the corner where you will see many STG members shooting. Move forward and a Cerberus shuttle arrives to drop off some Assault Troopers under cover of smoke. Once you finish them off, a second wave of six troopers arrives closer to the exit of this room, also under cover of smoke.
Finish those off and pick up the Shotgun Blade Attachment by the right wall. You can also use the Research Log along the right wall to learn about the yahg. Next to it is a medical station (150XP). On the curved bench in front of the door you will find a datapad with 2,500 credits. Approach the door at the end of the long room and open it. An imprisoned yahg escapes in spectacular fashion, but the resulting flames prevent you from going forward. Members of your squad may respond, with interesting variations if you've had previous encounters with a member of the species. Hop over the wall to your left to bypass the obstacle. Jump across the pit and pick up the Shotgun Spare Thermal Clip. Then jump back across the wall and head up the stairs.
Second level[]
Now you need to move quickly because you need to protect the shield on the pod. If you move quickly, even on Insanity, you can keep the pod at full integrity. Once you finish off the Cerberus Assault Troopers and Centurions, head down the room. On the wall across from the pod is a datapad worth 2,500 credits (hard to find; if you're staring at the pod, circle around half-turn and the datapad will be on a disabled terminal). Activate the checkpoint and a cut-scene plays.
During the cut-scene, two Assault Troopers attack you from inside a shuttle. Take them out, then go through the opening. Around the left corner, a couple of salarians are trying to hold off a Centurion in the distance. Another shuttle arrives to drop off more Assault Troopers. You can use a long-range weapon to easily end this fight. Take them out and pick up the Pistol High-Caliber Barrel along the left wall on the shelf. Open the door at the end of the room, and proceed around to the left and up the stairs.
Third level[]
It's a varren-eat-Cerberus world out there
If Major Kirrahe is present, you will see him kill some Assault Troopers with a Scorpion heavy pistol; if not, the salarian replacing him will get taken out quite quickly, making the battle that much harder. There are several Cerberus Engineers present, and they will set up very dangerous automated Turrets, and they will continue to place more if you don't finish them off or slow them down. Tip: Sabotage used on a Turret will cause it to lay waste to nearby enemies. If you don't have Sabotage available, a Stasis bubble used quickly enough can catch multiple Engineers before they can set their guns up. Engineers can repair damaged Turrets, so carefully snipe them or use any offensive tactic that affects a large area such as a grenade or Power Combo to prevent this.
Once all the enemies are down, on the right just inside the room are some Spare Parts that you can salvage for 3,750 credits. At the end of the room, on the right, activate the species observation area in order to advance. Do not move away from the scanner or you will have to wait for activation again.
Right behind the door, there is a medical station you can use (150XP). Go down the hall and open the door. You will watch a varren tear into an Assault Trooper, before his comrade shoots it down. Note:  It is impossible to kill the comrade before he has finished shooting the varren. The area will have another wave of Cerberus to fight, including two Guardians. Up the stairs on the right is a good path to take, but beware of a few enemies already on the upper level. Note that Assault Troopers can use their jet packs to jump up to the top too. In the middle of the room on the lower level will be some Armax Arsenal Greaves. Around the corner past the ladder on the lower level is a Sentry Interface and some Spare Parts for 3,750 credits to salvage. When you've collected everything, bypass the door on the upper level to continue.
Third level, second room[]
Do not run, we are your friends
Take out the Assault Troopers in the room. You'll then be told to re-route power for the containment pod to continue on, but first pick up some equipment. Hug the right wall from where you came in, and around the corner on a couch is the M-13 Raptor. Following the left wall from where you came in, you will come to a Pistol Scope next to a Research Terminal that contains information about STG's experiments with varren.
Continue following the left wall around the corner to a medical station on the wall (150XP) and in the corner of the same room, the Scorpion will be on the floor in the far right opposite the power terminal.
Finally go ahead and activate the power terminal, but be prepared to race back to protect the pod. Some more Assault Troopers, Centurions, and Guardians are about to appear. Clear the next checkpoint and fight off another wave of Cerberus enemies. The door near where you entered this room is now active. Return there and pass through the door. Jump across the open pit and climb up the ladder.
Fourth level[]
Eve firing the first of two shots from a Claymore shotgun
Sprint into the room because you're going to get a bunch of Assault Troopers and Centurions who will immediately start attacking the pod if you don't keep them held up. Note:  Once you've finished them off, don't delay in releasing the female because if you do, more troops will show up. Fortunately there's nothing that needs to be picked up in this room.
Once you activate the release, a cut-scene will play where an Atlas shows up. Hit it with as much as you have as quickly as you can because some Assault Troopers are also on the way and it's easy to be caught in the cross-fire. By hitting the Atlas hard and fast it is possible to destroy it before the last wave of Cerberus reaches engagement range, in which case the shuttle will pick you up immediately. But if they show up retreat to the back of the room before you get flanked.
The Urdnot leader talks to the female and she demonstrates that she can take care of herself by taking out two Cerberus soldiers. As the squad heads for the shuttle, Shepard is distracted by the dying gasps of a bloodied Cerberus soldier and tries to interrogate him. However, it is too late and the mortally-wounded man dies before he can reveal any information."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Benning:_Evidence,"Prerequisite: Priority: Palaven
Prerequisite: N7: Cerberus Abductions
On the Citadel Embassies, Ambassador Osoba can be overheard trying to find information about his missing son. Speak to him and you will find out that his son's squadmates returned from Benning without him but will not talk about what happened, and you can offer to help.
If you didn't speak with the ambassador, picking up the Dog Tag during a Hackett-sanctioned operation on Benning will result in this mission's acquisition. It is alternatively labeled Benning: Dog Tags in the journal entry.","Note: This mission must be completed before doing Priority: Tuchanka as it will be the last opportunity to visit the Citadel in its present state. It is no longer available the next time the civilian areas reopen, after Priority: The Citadel II.
That ship on the dog tag looks familiar...
This is another item retrieval mission within a mission. While you're on Benning, pay close attention to the building numbers painted on the sides of their doorways. From your starting position in the parent mission the tags are in an open area due northwest surrounded by building numbers 22, 25, and 27. The tags are on the ground near a support column near building 22. Look carefully as they are easily missed, and there are no Shepard quips indicating you obtained something once you get them.
If you missed the tags, you can purchase them from the Spectre Requisitions store in the Spectre Office at the Citadel Embassies for 1,000 credits base price and then present them to Osoba.
You gain 5 Reputation and 90 experience for completing this mission."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Hanar_Diplomat,"Prerequisite: Priority: Palaven
You will receive an email from Agent Bau asking you to meet him on the Citadel. He's standing outside Commander Bailey's office. Reading the email or just talking to Bau in person will activate the mission.
Help RequestFrom: Sender Blocked

Commander:

My name is Jondum Bau. I'm with Special Tactics & Recon.

While some still have concerns about your past activities with Cerberus, many of us in ST&R took your warnings about the Reapers seriously. I'm reaching out to you because I have information that could tie agents with significant political power to the Reapers.

If you have time to meet me in the Citadel Embassy, I'd appreciate your discreet assistance.

Sincerely,
Jondum Bau, STG, ST&R","A rare two-Spectre team-up, unwittingly sponsored by C-Sec
Talk to Bau about what is going on and he gives you an overview. Apparently, the Alliance raided a batarian science lab where the batarians were studying Reaper tech. It turned into a massacre and the Alliance got away with nothing. However, hanar operatives were there as well and Bau believes they were indoctrinated at that time. You can ask where Bau got the information, and the answer depends on whether you completed Kasumi: Stealing Memory or not. If you did, he says it came from Kasumi Goto, regardless of her survival in the Suicide Mission. Otherwise, he claims to have paid off Donovan Hock for the intel.
The implicated hanar operatives are now members of the hanar diplomatic delegation. Bau has tracked several suspicious transmissions between Kahje and the Citadel. Offer to help or doubt the mission's importance, you will gain the first of this mission's morality points whatever your response. As Bau leaves, he tells Shepard that not everyone ignored the Commander's warnings about the Reapers, and he hopes it isn't too late.
She makes a bonus appearance if you kept her alive from Mass Effect 2
If Kasumi isn't around, you regain control outside Bailey's office and must proceed to the Spectre office yourself. If Kasumi is alive, Shepard automatically goes to the Spectre office, where Kasumi decloaks upon the door's closure and offers to help. If you helped her retrieve Keiji Okuda's graybox, she claims to have leaked its contents regardless of the prior decision to keep or destroy the device: if the graybox was destroyed, she claims enough clues were left to piece things together when she got curious to peek again.
NavPoints[]
Bau maintains contact with you througout the mission through comms. If Kasumi is around, she also interjects from time to time without the salarian knowing about it. Go to the Spectre Terminal and select the Hanar Embassy Tracking option. Exit the terminal and Bau says that he is now checking security reports. Head over to the hanar embassy to track transfers coming from there.
If Kasumi is alive, she compliments Bau's plan and generally approves of the salarian despite his goal of arresting her. Otherwise, Bau shares his criteria of suspicious activity by ambassadorial staff.
The NavPoint is a terminal at the Office Suite, far west from Bailey's office. When you activate it, Shepard contacts Bau and reports strange money transfers from Bolohn and Oloon. Bau clears Bolohn, as his transfers are for his asari mistress, but he isn't sure about Oloon. Shepard offers to check Oloon's recent messages and personal records.
If Kasumi is around, she finds it odd that hanar have mistresses. Shepard attempts to lure her into saving the galaxy with promises of immunity from prosecution, but Kasumi doesn't bite. If Kasumi isn't around, Bau explains Bolohn's delicate political situation.
Mark this place as you may be doing a lot of investigating here in further missions
The next NavPoint is at Docks: Holding Area, right outside the elevator. When you access it, Shepard discovers Oloon's activities: heavy lobbying for the hanar to support the war effort. Bau says that it is clear that he isn't indoctrinated, and asks who's opposing him. Shepard reports an unnamed hanar, recently arrived from Kahje, and offers to check transit records. Head to the opposite side of the docking bays to continue.
If Kasumi is around, she references Shepard's predilection for hauling everyone into the war, citing Keiji's (destroyed, intact, or unrecovered) graybox as a factor for her non-involvement. Otherwise, Bau comments on the hanar species' ""mild"" xenophobia.
Access the terminal on the far end of the Docks Holding Area to contact Bau and Shepard forwards him a list of new hanar arrivals. Bau deems the list useless as it is all face names, while the ones from the Alliance raid are soul names. As soul names aren't public, Bau asks Shepard to tap back into their communications.
If Kasumi is around, she asks about the rest of the gang. Shepard brings up Garrus, or EDI and Joker if the turian isn't around, but Kasumi's really only interested in Jacob. Otherwise, Bau feels his suspicions on indoctrinated hanar were correct.
Head back to the terminal at the elevator. Accessing the terminal has Shepard contact Bau again and forward him the hanar communications. Bau says he's got it, a recent arrival named Zymandis. He was with the Alliance team that massacred the batarians and has been in a ""special research assignment"" ever since.
Go back to the Embassies. Once there, return to the office suite on the left side of the elevator where Bau will meet you. Select Bau to continue.
The Suspect[]
A big, stupid (diabolical) jellyfish
Bau and Shepard (joined by a cloaked Kasumi if she's around) head into the office to apprehend Zymandis. You can ask the hanar about his motivations or just go straight to the business of arresting him, but it is clear he has been indoctrinated. Depending on your choice, Shepard may call him a ""big stupid jellyfish"" to his ""face"". Morality points are again available depending on how you proceed.
Zymandis says that the defenses for the hanar homeworld are largely automated, and can be shut down by a single virus, which he has just uploaded. Bau quickly springs into action and attempts to block the transmission, but a human bodyguard standing at the door quickly puts his hands around Bau's throat. Bau attempts to throw him off.
Elite Spectre-STG agent fails to anticipate a choking hazard
If Kasumi is alive, she runs up to the terminal to stop the upload, and succeeds. Shepard knocks out the man holding Bau while Bau pulls out his gun and shoots Zymandis. Kasumi then notices that the hanar has rigged a failsafe. The console explodes and knocks Kasumi against a wall, who disappears beneath her cloak.
If you did Kasumi's loyalty mission, when Bau exits the room Kasumi gets out of her cloak when Shepard ""luckily guesses"" her presence. She still won't be pressured into joining the fight, so the Commander wants her as a technical expert on the Crucible instead. That, and Shepard convinces her there's a lot of expensive tech lying around unguarded. If you didn't help her secure Keiji's graybox, she won't reappear after the explosion.
If Kasumi isn't around, you must choose between saving Bau (using a Renegade interrupt) or stopping the upload."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/N7:_Communication_Hub,"Prerequisite: Priority: Thessia
Specialist Traynor mentions the hub after the mission on Thessia.","Note the two moons
The location is not mentioned in either the Codex entry for the planet or in the mission briefing; it is located in the Kepler Verge, which is just up and to the right of Shadow Sea or almost straight right of the Ninmah Cluster.
You are dropped off in a combat zone that is the multiplayer map Firebase Dagger. The drop zone is hot so set up your squad's ammo/defensive powers quickly and take cover. Your initial opposition will be basic Assault Troopers and Centurions, plus a single Combat Engineer. Take him out first if possible before he can set up any Turrets. Caution: Sometimes the Engineer will have sneakily left a Turret on the raised area near the first terminal so be very cautious when approaching, and avoid using the ladder. A good way to check to make sure you've eliminated every hostile is to see if you can make a manual save; if not, there's likely still an active enemy somewhere and it might be a Turret. After you've wiped Cerberus out, you can spend as much time as you want looking around before activating the first console at the NavPoint to proceed, so find the following:
From your starting location, drop down into the courtyard. Head left, then take an immediate left up the ramp where you'll see a medkit right in front of you. To the left of this medkit against the wall there will be a console with the Cerberus Codes needed for Citadel: Cerberus Ciphers, and to the right of the medkit will be two red barrels with another ""Cerberus Technology"" worth 3,000 credits. There is another medkit on the ground further along.
A faceful of surprise
Continuing around the edge of the map, you'll head up another ramp near the outside wall where there's an ammo and grenade resupply. Nearby there's what looks like a jet engine on top of a crate with another ""Cerberus Technology"" worth 3,000 credits. Head forward, but just before the next ramp, turn right and drop down the ladder leading to the underside of the satellite dish. Right in front of you will be a set of Ariake Technology Greaves. Go around the other side of the central pillar where you'll see two red barrels on top of a crate with a final ""Cerberus Technology"" worth 4,000 credits.
Continue forward toward the left-side ramp. When you get to the ramp, turn right to pick up another medkit. Go up the ramp, turn left and go up the second ramp. Turn left again to get into the circular room under the satellite dish itself. There's a medical station on the wall next to the right-side door.
Once you've got all the loot, go ahead and deactivate the console. After this, a second NavPoint appears, along with more Cerberus troops. This next wave includes a few Nemeses. Tip: Place your squadmates in cover positions anticipating enemies approaching from the direction you came from before hitting the console, as enemies will appear and begin attacking almost immediately.
Steve takes his job seriously especially if there are damsels in distress
After the second wave is dead, make your way to the second terminal back on the far side of the map near where you started and disable it. A cutscene and dialogue with Ms. Grace Sato occurs with a dialogue choice (which has no morality reward); receive the info on the third NavPoint's location, and prepare for the final wave. Note:  When you activate the second NavPoint, triggering the cutscene, any downed squad members will be revived for free. Also, if you manage to draw enemies away from the NavPoints (or if you are an Infiltrator), there is no requirement to kill any of the enemies in the NavPoint portion of the mission.
The final wave includes several more Nemeses accompanied by multiple Centurions and also a Phantom, so be prepared. The Nemeses start in the central tower which is a natural sniper perch with high ground and clear lines of sight to you and your squad if you remain on the low ground by the second terminal which can result in you getting pinned there while the Phantom closes to lethal range. A good strategy can be to immediately rush to the left towards the entrance ramp of the main building before the snipers really home in on you, which will put you out of the line of fire of the snipers in the tower once you get inside, however you will likely run into 1-2 Centurions blocking your path. Be cautious about advancing too far inside, and keep your eyes and ears open for the Phantom, as the direction it comes from can vary and sometimes it will be waiting inside the tower for you. Once the final wave is down, be sure to grab any loot you've missed—once you deactivate the third station, the mission will end shortly after.
Completing the mission gives you +5 Reputation, 10,000 credits, and a Communications Array War Asset."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Namakli:_Leviathan,"Prerequisite: Leviathan: Find Ann Bryson
The journal entry for this mission is automatically acquired upon landing on Namakli.","In the shuttle Shepard and the squad discuss the intel found up to this point. Cortez notes that if Ann is on the planet, she has not been responding to hails. However, Reapers are present and swarming around the dig site. Cortez drops the landing party off, but then gets chased off by Harvesters.
How many wormnecks?
Warning: The numerous Harvesters circling overhead will take shots at you. This only occurs in the first half of the level before reaching Ann Bryson. These bombardments are not related to an actual Harvester spawning that you can target and is instead an ""environmental hazard"" of the level. Taking cover will not protect you from this, even staying inside structures will not necessarily keep you safe as the Harvester attacks possess a significant area of effect that can penetrate light cover or thin walls.  There is actually no way to guarantee you won't get hit or even killed once the bombardments start but having Defense Matrix as a bonus power to instantly restore your shields can be a life saver.  The bombardments appear to start targeting you after you linger in a particular area too long, so keep moving.  Once the bombardments start your only real chance is to stay in a safe spot inside an enclosed area, wait until you hear the sound of the Harvester volleys hit your location, and then make a break for it.  If you can reach a new area fast enough, you will ""refresh"" the timer on when new bombardments start again.  Once you reach Ann Bryson, you're in the clear from this very annoying hazard.
Head to the Elevator[]
Move ahead on the walkway: Ann will contact you, saying she will come to meet you. Shepard insists she stay where she is: they'll come to her. Ann will then give you a nav point for an elevator. Go into the structure and keep moving forward. The ladders to the side lead to the same areas as the forward path, so choose whichever way you prefer.
Running and dying with style
Eventually, you will encounter Cannibals by some explosive barrels. Dispose of the Cannibals however you wish, and be sure to pick up the AT-12 Raider shotgun off the body in front of the structure the Cannibals exited. Move into this same building and pick up the SMG High-Velocity Barrel on the left side.
After you exit the structure you come to a dead end. Turn around and climb up the ladder. Kill the Husk waiting for you, then find a place to jump across to the rocky area. The bridge control panel there needs to be fixed: one of your teammates will volunteer to do so while you fight off some Husks.
After the Husks are defeated, the squad member will have finished with the controls just in time for the arrival of a Banshee. Take care of her, then move on. You'll encounter a few more Husks on your way to the elevator. Remember to keep pressing forward with alacrity and stay near cover, because the Harvesters will increasingly bombard you. Note:  If the bridge is up, you can run for the ladder instead of dealing with the Banshee.
Elevator Problems[]
Lobbing grenades with style
When you activate the elevator controls, the car comes down part of the way but is blocked because of damage to the elevator shaft. Shepard contacts Ann for a workaround--she activates a door one level up and gives a new nav point. Go into the building next to the elevator to find an SMG Recoil System on a counter. Keep moving up and around the wreckage. You'll encounter more Cannibals accompanied by two Ravagers--be careful, as one of the Ravagers is on a balcony above you and may be able to target you behind low cover. In the building on the right is data that can be salvaged (2500 credits).
After taking care of the enemies, climb up the ladder and you'll find a Med Kit in the building. There may also be a couple Cannibals that were too shy to come out in the preceding fight. There is an ammo-pile on the left wall if you need it. Move out onto the balcony from which the Ravager had been shooting. At the end of it, Shepard will comment about the way being blocked: simply turn around and climb up the ladder, then navigate around the debris. After you've done so, Ann will contact Shepard about the Reapers pinning her team and her down. Keep moving forward and dispose of the occasional Cannibals that try to stop you.
Bulldozing enemies with style
Eventually you'll be able to climb onto a structure and move to the rock wall to which the buildings are attached. There are many Husks and a Brute that attack soon after you do so. You may want to take advantage of the explosive barrels that litter this area.
Move forward and a platform will collapse in front of you. Move back to the structures and keep going. You'll encounter Cannibals and a Marauder backed up by a Harvester. Do enough damage to the Harvester, and it will fly off, leaving just the Cannibals. After taking them out, pick up the Med Kit on the path by the corner of the building. Note:  the Harvester appears after the other enemies - if you remain on the high ground to kill all the other enemies before it appears then it will appear out of nowhere and ambush you just as you are crossing the open ground. That can be deadly on higher difficulty levels, so it is suggested you cross before engaging the Cannibals.
There is a Ravager on the balcony facing you as you turn the corner. Take it out now or move into the building away from its fire, take out the Cannibals inside, and move forward to shoot at it from the side while it is distracted by your squad. Along the wall between the first entrance and the one where the Ravager is/was located is an Assault Rifle Omni-Blade. Near the exit there is also Damaged Machinery to salvage for 2500 credits.
Move forward and a squadmate will yell about the elevator. Don't activate it just yet: there's a Med Kit and Data to salvage (5000 credits) inside the building just before the elevator controls.
He's not burning because he's being electrified
Activate the elevator and you will finally meet Ann Bryson. She's the only one of the team left. She'll explain what she knows about Leviathan and the artifact she found. They move toward the artifact which is emitting energy toward the Reaper creatures surrounding it. Ann appears to lose control and begins speaking in a deep voice not her own. Shepard's squadmates shoot the artifact to destroy it, breaking the spell. Shepard calls Cortez for a pick-up and orders Ann to run when she sees the shuttle. Time to kill more Reapers.
Kill the Harvester[]
Fire / Fuego / Incendio
First there are Cannibals and a Harvester. The Cannibals are scattered and not too much of a threat, and Cortez needs the Harvester gone to come in safely, so make it your priority. It will die fairly quickly if you have any sort of grenades: using them sets off a chain reaction of exploding barrels. Likewise, hitting it with any sort of fire or biotic explosion will tend to create a massive chain reaction.
Warning:  It is possible for your squad to get stuck on the high ledge after the cutscene rather than joining you below during this battle; if this occurs, they can still shoot and use powers from where they are. To unglitch them, you have to run forward or in circles for a bit and they will ""teleport"" down to you, but this can be quite dangerous to do in an active combat situation. The only other solution is to reload a save and hope this doesn't occur.
Marauders begin to accompany the Cannibals after the Harvester dies. You do not need to defeat the enemies to complete the mission, you can just head to the shuttle; however, attempting to do so right away can be risky as spawning Marauders can drop right on top of you dealing heavy damage and leaving you totally exposed.
On the way to the shuttle there is a Med Kit on a desk to the left. In the building to the right of Cortez, there is another Med Kit and salvageable data (2500 credits), though the open area leading to the structure can be difficult to traverse without eliminating all enemies first. If you manage to reach the building unscathed, there is a ladder allowing for safer and almost direct passage to the shuttle from there."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Priority:_Perseus_Veil,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel II
After leaving the Citadel following the failed Cerberus attack, Admiral Hackett informs you that the quarians are willing to aid in the war against the Reapers and tells Shepard to travel to the Far Rim to meet with them.","This is a simple conversation-only mission. Morality points are available depending on your responses.
Left to right: Gerrel, Koris, Raan, Xen
Go to Dholen in the Far Rim to dock with the Quarian Envoy Ship. A cutscene will take place in the Normandy's war room with the Migrant Fleet's admirals. The admirals reveal that they have begun an open war with the geth, pushing them back to their homeworld, Rannoch, when the geth were given upgrades by the Reapers. They request the Normandy's assistance in disabling a geth dreadnought broadcasting the Reaper signal.
If Tali'Zorah survived the events of Mass Effect 2, she will join the team. If she was not exiled by her people, then she will have been appointed as an admiral as well, having taken over for her father, Rael'Zorah. Tali will still appear if she had been exiled because of her knowledge of the geth. Shepard will refer to Tali as their 'dirty little secret' due to the admirals keeping her presence hidden from the rest of the quarians. You will discuss plans regarding Rannoch and the war against the geth with her, and can invite her up to your cabin to speak privately or lock in Romance with her if you are continuing one from Mass Effect 2.
Note:  If this is your first ever playthrough of Mass Effect 3 talking to Tali in your cabin will also unlock Energy Drain as a bonus power that you can assign to yourself in the medical bay."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Grissom_Academy:_Emergency_Evacuation,"Prerequisite: Priority: Palaven
After the Palaven mission and EDI's formal squadmate introduction, Samantha Traynor will ask through ambient dialogue to speak with you.
She was scanning Alliance comm channels and came across an evac request from the Academy. A turian vessel has responded to the call, but Traynor thought something was off in their signal. After working with EDI, Traynor believes the signal came from Cerberus, and that the Academy is still in danger. If your Shepard was imported from Mass Effect 2, the situation seems familiar.
Warning: If you do not complete the mission before Priority: The Citadel II, it will be no longer available and considered failed.","Travel to the Petra Nebula, and enter orbit at Grissom Academy.
Infiltrate Grissom Academy[]
Normandy distracting the Cerberus Fighters
On approach, EDI and Joker will note that there are too many Cerberus ships blockading the Academy for the Normandy to either sneak by or win a direct fight. Kahlee Sanders comes over the communications channel requesting aid, and reports that Cerberus have taken over the docking bays. She can open a cargo hold door, however. A cutscene follows showing Joker creating a diversion so that Shepard and the squad can take the shuttle into the school.
As the squad moves along the corridor, Kahlee reports that she is trapped in the security office just ahead by Cerberus operatives, who are trying to get in. Move to the door and be prepared to fight immediately after opening it. Four Assault Troopers are on the other side: Kahlee will immediately kill the two by the door on the right. After dealing with the other two enemies, examine the damaged door.
Inside, you are greeted by Kahlee, who has some flattering things to say about Shepard. She will inform you that there are fewer than twenty students remaining at the school, most of whom are either producing tech for the Alliance or are biotics in training for military service. If you ask about Admiral Anderson, you will find out that he and Sanders go back to the time when he was a Spectre candidate. Proceed through the conversation however you see fit, but it will be interrupted by news that Cerberus has a group of students trapped in Orion Hall. Shepard will rejoin the squad in the corridor and Kahlee will open the door at its far end.
Stranded Students[]
Typical frat initiation
You will be greeted by the sight of Cerberus operatives dragging a student through a doorway. This is a background animation and cannot be interfered with. Pick up the ammo on the couch, if you need it, then proceed through the door to the right. A Cerberus commander will come over the intercom informing students that Cerberus has taken control of the school, and they will be perfectly safe as long as they do not resist. Hop over the wall to the right to pick up the Assault Rifle Stability Damper.
Open the door and proceed through. When you round the corner on the left side of the room, you'll find two Assault Troopers talking to a biotic student who has surrounded himself with a barrier. Both troopers have their backs to you, allowing for an easy headshot and the chance to take them both out before they can react. Pick up the datapad (+1250 Credits) at the end of the couch on the right side of the room. If you speak to the boy, Reiley Bellarmine, Shepard will tell him to play dead until the coast is clear and then run back to Kahlee, and he will comply after mentioning that his sister Seanne is still inside the school. Jump over the barrier to proceed.
A bullet in the head if you're not important
Examine the tactical analysis review (+20 XP) on the desk ahead, pick up the SMG Heat Sink on the desk in the center of the room, and the personal log (+20 XP) on the desk at the right end of the room. Head through the nearby door. Upon going through the next door after that, you will witness a fleeing student being gunned down by Cerberus troops. Several operatives will then enter through the two doors at the far end of the room. You can take down the Shield Generator near the fallen student to remove their primary means of cover. Tip: Shoot the generator when enemies are standing near it to create a damaging explosion. There will be one or two Assault Troopers, but the bulk of this unit is made up of Centurions with full shields.
Go into the hallway on the left to pick up the M-22 Eviscerator. Head back past the fallen student and continue through the next room, moving straight ahead. To the left will be Seanne Bellarmine; speak to her quickly, because if you stand around too long she will die from her wounds. One of your squadmates will speak up if you are about to run out of time to save her. On the couch near her is the Mnemonic Visor. There is a locker (+1250 credits) across the room and an M-96 Mattock on the couch in the middle of the room. Finally, go down the corridor towards Orion Hall.
Orion Hall[]
The hall seems smaller with an Atlas around
As you approach the door, Kahlee will tell you that she has just received an emergency message from the students in Orion Hall. Before entering, take out the generator to the right of the door, which will allow Kahlee to address the students over the PA. She will inform them that help is here, and will warn the students not to let Cerberus take them alive.
Proceed through the second door at the end of the corridor to see the biotic students defending themselves against Assault Troopers. If a Mass Effect 2 save was imported and Jack survived the Suicide Mission, she will be with the students; otherwise, Ensign Jason Prangley will step up and take charge.
An Atlas breaks into the room. The students retreat behind a biotic barrier; you must defeat the enemies before the barrier wears down. The Atlas is dangerous if you get in its line of fire, but it is slow and will not take any more interest in Shepard than in your squadmates.
The Assault Troopers and Centurions in the middle of the room are fast and may drift dangerously around your flanks, though they often get distracted attacking the students. Tip: On higher difficulty levels, you may want to concentrate on lowering the population of troopers before taking on the Atlas, particularly because it can regenerate its shields if left alone for a time. At the beginning of the encounter, the troopers will be huddled together, so using a few Power Combos can make quick work of them. Sabotage can force the Atlas to assist you temporarily if you have it available.
These kids are targeted by Cerberus but they can provide some hefty biotic backup in a pinch
After the battle, Jack punches Shepard in the face. If a male Shepard had a relationship with Jack in Mass Effect 2, the punch is followed up with a kiss, and the reason given for the punch is Shepard leaving her. Otherwise, the reason given is for previously trusting Cerberus. There will be opportunities for some unique interactions between Jack and several squad members, with an interesting variation if Garrus is present and also the love interest of a female Shepard.
If Jack is not present, the students say that their CO was killed, leaving Prangley in charge. In addition, without the benefit of Jack as their teacher, a student, Ensign Rodriguez, will ask you if you ever forget the first time you kill someone, giving you extra Paragon or Renegade points.
The students need a few minutes to rest and recharge after their ordeal fending off Cerberus. Cortez comes over the communications channel to say that the Cerberus cruiser is returning, and it's too dangerous for him to keep the shuttle docked for more than another two minutes. Shepard orders him to get back to the Normandy, then informs Kahlee, who comes up with an alternative way out of the facility.
Relative to where you first entered the room, immediately turn left and find a data log (+20 XP) listing Prangley as a high-priority capture target, and the Cerberus camera control Kahlee tasks you with finding. On the opposite side of the room is a Med Kit (+100 XP). In the balcony room where the students are, you will find the Assault Rifle Precision Scope at the back of the room and a datapad (+1875 Credits) at the front. Use the door override controls in the middle of the back wall to open the door to the Atrium.
Tip: If this is a first playthrough it may be a good time to check if you have leveled up.
Head back downstairs. You can speak to Jack for some exposition if she is present. If asked, she will express her opinion that the students are likely better off as support units rather than on the front lines. Her dialog here can vary depending on if she was the biotic specialist during the Suicide Mission, and also depending on the fate of Mordin Solus if this is after Priority: Tuchanka. Save here because you won't get to save after you open the door.
When ready, proceed to the door to the Atrium, located at the end of the corridor under the balcony room. The biotics suggest that they follow a different route to the squad, attacking Cerberus from above. Respond however you like, then get treated to the Cerberus announcer telling the students that the Alliance soldiers are going to get them killed and that they should just surrender. Again, respond how you wish; Jack's response here will vary depending on your dialog choice.
Atrium, Part 1[]
Take note of the cover and flanking areas
The next room contains the hardest fight yet. There is an Atlas accompanied by waves of Centurions, Guardians, and Combat Engineers. Prepare yourself for a long fight. The biotic students will help you with any enemies that stay on the ramp or high enough up on the stairs, but don't depend on them to do too much of the work for you.
Javik's Pull is useful here for removing the riot shields from Guardians and his Lift Grenades are excellent for weakening positions fortified by shield pylons. Liara's biotics are also very powerful here, particularly Stasis with the ""Bubble"" upgrade, as it will instantly disable any unarmored enemy, including freezing Guardians while removing their shields (Singularity is also extremely effective against Guardians). Garrus can strip shielding from enemies with Overload and can also do serious work at long range if equipped with a powerful sniper rifle capable of penetrating cover (or enhanced to do so with his Armor-Piercing Ammo).
Cerberus goons
It might be a good idea to just open the door and stand there, letting the first wave of Centurions and Guardians come to you. In this way, you can take out several enemies before the bulk of them engage you.
Combat Strategy: If you are VERY cautious about retreating and aware of enemies trying to flank, you can fight almost all Cerberus units except the Atlas from the corridor or just beyond, retreating back inside if needed. You are too far away at this point for the Atlas to target you, allowing you to save it for last. The cover inside the corridor is limited to the right side of the door and the gap between the rows of chairs.
After venturing into the Atrium, you'll have to move around from cover to cover in order to stay safe, because there are a lot of enemies entering from various directions throughout this fight and they will all converge on you. Note: It is possible for the door to close behind Shepard before squadmates have gotten out, leaving them temporarily trapped inside the corridor. Manually ordering them to a position in the Atrium before you exit will avoid this happening.
Stay out of the line of fire of any Turrets set up by the Combat Engineers and move around picking off enemies. Infiltrators and Engineers can Sabotage the Turrets to cause maximum carnage. There are Shield Pylons that you should take out to give yourself an easier time.
Again, take note of the cover and flanking areas
Alternative Strategy: The courtyard is divided into two by a huge wall, and the Atlas is on the other side of that wall and cannot cross. This leads to a second possible strategy: if you turn right from the door you emerged from and race all the way up the ramp towards a Shield Pylon right next to the dividing wall, you gain a cover position with a commanding view of the area that is also out of line of sight of the Atlas. Be cautious though, as enemies can sometimes spawn in this position and will fortify it themselves if you don't head there ASAP.
The only thing to be wary of is that two Guardians will spawn at that high ground. Shooting the shield generator in the upper corner, and following with a Stasis Bubble, will usually catch both of them. Whoever is leading the biotic students will shout ""Up here!"" at the moment they spawn.
The rest of the fight should be fairly straightforward. If you're carrying the Venom Shotgun, you can charge its shots to annihilate the Cerberus forces as they attempt to land just below you. Finally, take the Atlas out, because next you're going over to its half of the courtyard.
After all of the enemies are down, replenish your ammo and move through the door on the lower level. Pick up the mission brief (+20 XP) on the chairs on the left, open the Med Kit (+100 XP) on the right, and pick up any additional ammo you need. Use the computer on the left farther down the corridor (+3750 Credits). If you had not leveled up earlier, check and see if you have now before moving through the door.
Atrium, Part 2[]
Cerberus flanking tactics
This is the other side of the Atrium. There are one or two Centurions and Guardians and several Combat Engineers, but the bulk of the enemy force is made up of Assault Troopers. The biotics students will continue to help you.
When planning your cover, be aware that enemies will be arriving over the walls and also dropping in on the upper level which is out of line of sight above the doorway you enter from. The upper level can be reached by two ramps located a short distance inside the room one on either side of the door. During the battle, Rodriguez will be hit, but don't let the shouts for medi-gel distract you; she'll live. In the Wii U version of the game, the exclusive M-597 Ladon heavy weapon can be found in this room, which will make this section much easier. When no hostiles remain, Kahlee will update Shepard on Cerberus activity.
Combat Strategy: Opening the door is what triggers enemies to spawn, but they can't follow past the door so you can patiently thin most of them out from the doorway, retreating back as needed. However, there will likely be a few enemies and Turrets that you can't see on the upper level right above the door, so you'll have to enter the room eventually to take them out. It's a good idea to do so by hugging the wall to the right past the door so you don't get blindsided by any Turrets on the high ground.
Breather Segment[]
Octavia, random student and Cerberus goons
There is nothing of interest in this area, so after the enemies are down move through the door at the far end of the Atrium, replenish your ammo if needed, then head through the next door. A computer terminal to the right can be accessed (+4375 Credits). To the left, two of the tech students are fending off two Assault Troopers with a barrier/shield combo device. You can listen to a short conversation between Octavia and the troopers, and then take the troopers out.
You can now speak to Octavia, who is understandably distrustful of Shepard. You can either contact Kahlee to convince her that you're a friend, a squadmate can disable the shield, or Shepard can shoot through the shield. If Overlord was completed in Mass Effect 2 and you followed the Paragon route at the end, David Archer will be present and will vouch for you. He will unlock the door to a security office at the end of the corridor, which contains another M-96 Mattock, or a M-22 Eviscerator (granting one free upgrade level of either weapon if both were already obtained), and a Sniper Rifle Piercing Mod. David has some extra dialogue if you have brought Garrus or EDI with you.
Head through the door and collect the Biotic Amp Schematics from the terminal on the right. In the next room, retrieve the Serrice Council Chestplate from the couch on the left.
Endgame Mayhem[]
The next room has an empty Atlas and a Combat Engineer, who is standing with his back to you. Open the Med Kit (+100 XP) on the couch on your right, and access the engineer's data log on the floor (+20 XP) to find out that Rodriguez is another high-priority target for Cerberus indoctrination. If you wish, you can climb into the Atlas and head up the stairs to the docking area. There is an SMG Magazine Upgrade on the bench to the left of the entrance you came in: remember to pick it up after the fighting. You can also examine the statue of Jon Grissom in the middle of the room.
There will be many waves of Assault Troopers, Guardians, and Centurions, but you should be able to handle all of them from the Atlas. Just be sure to be near cover if your armor starts to get dangerously low, because you will want to evacuate. However, even on Insanity, the Atlas is pretty sturdy. There will be several waves of ground troops emerging from various points around the room.
After almost all of the ground troops are down, an enemy Atlas will come through the door where you entered. When Kahlee shouts that ""the shuttles are almost ready"" you'll know the Atlas will appear soon. Atlas Tip: The secondary missile attack of the Atlas is mainly useful for groups of enemies who aren't in cover; its cooldown period isn't surfaced very intuitively, so just remember it is available to fire approximately every five shots from your main gun.
Tip: By bringing the empty Atlas up and parking it right in the doorway at the top of the staircase, you can block the way of the enemy Atlas and prevent it from entering the room, allowing for an easy kill. Leaving an Atlas in the doorway also prevents the door from shutting, meaning you can retreat down the stairs if necessary.
When all hostiles are down, Kahlee will call for you to head to the shuttle. Go through the door at the far right of the room from where you entered.
A cutscene will play showing the students and your squad rushing for the shuttle, where it is discovered that the wounded Rodriguez has fallen behind and is being pursued by Cerberus operatives. Shepard will attempt to break through the glass separating the rooms to get to her, but whoever is in charge of the biotics squad will biotically smash the glass first. If it's Jack, everyone makes it to the shuttle. If it's Prangley, he is shot and killed.
Once inside the shuttle, if Jack isn't around, Kahlee will request that Shepard rethink having the students play a military role. Otherwise, she will state that perhaps they are ready for front-line combat after all. Make your choice.
You will then be returned to the Normandy for a video conference with Anderson, who will discuss the war and ask about Kahlee. Following the conversation, you will receive 12,500 credits in Alliance funding.

Tactical Analysis Review: Student ID #275668

Unshielded opponent approaching at two o'clock--shielded opponent approaching at twelve o'clock. Both holding heavy pistols. Most effective way to take them down?

You chose: Shockwave

Correct Answer: Singularity followed by Warp

Instructor Comments: Shockwave inadequate against shielded enemy. Your barrier would hold long enough against heavy pistols for a Singularity to catch both. Warp on the unstable biotic field created by the Singularity results in an explosion neutralizing both enemies.
The following log appears only if Jack survived the Suicide Mission.
Instructor's Log:

The kids are getting better at this shit, but I'm worried. I don't think we've got enough time to pull this off and there's just no way they could really survive out there without way more training. Not without any field experience at all.

Doing my best to get them ready. Didn't think I'd ever care this much. But I won't let anyone hurt 'em. They're my kids.

MINE.

When you are dropped off you see the entrance area to the facility has been nearly destroyed. Your squadmates make a note on it. Walk towards it and a Cerberus shuttle will crash above the entrance, checked upon by a Harvester that apparently shot it down. You can't fight it; it flies off after seeing the wreckage. Shepard remarks that it's about time Cerberus and the Reapers started fighting each other.
A few steps onward and you'll have to deal with two Phantoms that come from the crashed shuttle as well as a Nemesis. The Nemesis takes cover on the balcony barricades while the Phantoms drop down to engage in close range. There's plenty of debris in the area for cover, so take your time dealing with the ladies. When that's done, by the foot of the stairs at the north end of the secluded depression on your right are parts you can salvage for 1,500 credits.
Where the hell is everyone? I want to speak to the manager
Continue into the facility; there is a medical station by the door. The door also seals shut once you enter; there's no backing out. If you paid attention to the eye on the bottom of your screen and pressed the button for navigational assistance, one of your squadmates will point out the Cerberus shuttles seemingly appearing from the tower above and Shepard will say that's where the team is going. But first, if you're not in a hurry, explore the reception area.
Near the windows on the leftmost side, below the conspicuous overhead screens you can examine a terminal with security footage of Sanctuary. In the area apparently used as office space, there are 3 audio logs and a PDA to examine, all pertaining to Sanctuary's refugee processing administration, as well as an inventory log worth 1,500 credits. Clean them out if you want then proceed downstairs.
Sanctuary Reception[]
""All security procedures are in place to protect you and your loved ones.""
To the left and down the stairs by the crashed Alliance shuttles are 2 audio logs, left behind by civilians by the sound of them. In the lobby to the right as you came down the stairs, the one with the big glowing SANCTUARY logo on it, there a few dead rachni and Cerberus goons. This should alert you to prepare for war, since just beyond the big wall obstructing the view there are 4 live Cerberus Troopers; 2 near the console and 2 next to a dead Ravager.
There's a Pistol Scope mod next to a dead Cerberus soldier in front of the raised desk. Continue through the door labeled POOL MAINTENANCE right next to the SANCTUARY logo. A console will have a recording of Miranda (if she's alive) or Oriana (if she isn't), telling you to turn back and that the facility isn't what you think it is. Watching it is optional, as are most of the succeeding console videos left by the Lawson daughter that you will encounter as you explore Sanctuary.
The room has a wall safe containing unspecified ""equipment"" by the opening you just came through. Salvage it for 1,500 credits and continue through the large opening that is now to your left.
Indoctrinating the water supply seems smart until it becomes sapient and starts killing all of Cerberus' guys
You'll come to a large ornamental pool that doubles as a water processing facility as well as a backdoor into Sanctuary's inner facilities. You can't miss it, it has a lot of greenery and flowers in addition to a dead Cerberus trooper floating facedown and a Harvester corpse. Use the water pump security panel to drain the pool, and head down the ladder. One of your squadmates will examine the strange machinery formerly submerged in the water, pointing out it has Reaper tech.
That said, go through the door on the former lake's other side. First room is empty except for possible additional squad comments on the Reaper tech. The second chamber has a couple of salvageables: equipment on your right (1,500 credits) and Rosenkov Materials Shoulder Plate to the left of the next door.
Some people are too confident on their Bond villain lair security measures, some are just careless
The next room is a command center and a squadmate tells you to turn on the power; to do so, use the computer in the middle of the room. You will see footage of Cerberus turning the refugees into husks. Shepard then walks to the other computer in front of the room's glass window to turn the lights on, leading to a view of the husk-infested facility beyond. The creatures quickly disperse: one gives a jump scare by creeping across the command center windows, though then again there's actually a bunch of them crawling Spider-Man style as the camera zooms out.
In the aftermath one of your squadmates could not fathom what Cerberus could possibly gain by making husks. Shepard reminds them the Reapers attacked Sanctuary because it became a threat, and it's your job to discover why.
In the next room there is yet another video console you can watch in the corner on the far end, it shows Oriana/Miranda shutting down the power and Kai Leng not too far behind her. Also in this room is a PDA log that explains about the ""recycling"" being performed.
Mere appetizers for the battles ahead
Go down the stairs and open the doors, but be prepared for a lot of husks. Unless you retreat, you'll basically face them in a flight of stairs - you going down, they going up - use it to your advantage. Below the stairs is another array of workstations, with two logs that explain something from Henry Lawson, Miranda and Oriana's father, about the deception. There's also 2 boxes of thermal clips and grenades for your restocking needs in addition to 2 more thermal clips next to a log.
Laboratories[]
The next room is a long hallway stretching to the right, divided lengthwise. It's the place you saw infested with husks earlier, right below the command center. The larger of the two spaces, (the one up the stairs) is more exposed, but the sheltered one (behind the door) is of lower elevation. Both of them are exposed to 2 unreachable platforms on the left side of the length of the hall, from which Marauders will spawn to shoot down at you. A Ravager is in the next room labeled ""INCUBATION RESEARCH 02"" and a Banshee spawns in the large overhead platform; both of them will proceed to the main area to hunt you down. The Reaper forces appear once you either open the door or climb the stairs, and the Banshee's distinctive screech more than confirms it.
Her literally dazzling looks is something NOT to die for
Honestly, your best bet might be to retreat back up the stairs you came from and camp: this will lure the Banshee and Ravager out of position, separating them from the Marauders and denying them their terrain advantage. The Marauders sometimes spawn at ground level instead of the platforms, although they may try to jump back to them. As the battlefield has a lot of waist-high obstacles, be wary of doing combat rolls back into one especially if the Banshee is almost upon you.
The room labeled ""INCUBATION RESEARCH 02"" has a med kit and 2 more logs from Henry Lawson, one of which is about Paul Grayson. Accessing the logs prompts a comment from one of your squadmates. You could see another Banshee behind a window, but it can't get to you as it's in a sealed room, so ignore it and go through the door on your right.
Search the Perimeter[]
There's another console with a Lawson daughter's voice coming from it. Watch her announce she's heading to the tower to disable the communications scrambler. To your left, you can pick up research data worth 1,500 credits. There is also a PDA here.
PROTIP: scope out and neutralize the purple glowing things BEFORE they become purple glowing things
Head up the stairs towards a two-door hallway. Prepare to encounter a group of Marauders and Cannibals, supported by 4 Barrier Engines. Try to deal with these from the doorway or a general distance; entering the hallway leaves you prone to being flanked. Three of the Barrier Engines can be taken out from the entrance area; two of them without spawning the Reapers, all 3 if you have wall-piercing guns. The fourth one is just too obscured at the far end of the room and will require you to come closer.
This large lab area details more of Henry's progress making husks, calling it ""assembly-line science"". The right side has the M-12 Locust, thermal clip and grenade boxes, and a Shotgun Blade Attachment. The left side has 2 logs. At the far left end is a PDA and another Lawson daughter console, containing evidence her father is working for the Illusive Man (in case you hadn't figured it out by now). You then get another clip of Henry and the Illusive Man talking about their experiments, which are about gaining control of husks, and they've made significant progress: indefinite short-range control, with controlling the Reaper ships themselves a considerable challenge but on the horizon.
With the link to Cerberus definitively established, you press onward. However there's one more scene on the screen: Kai Leng getting the drop on the Lawson daughter, with the video cutting off before anything else happens.
Unlike the other Lawson daughter consoles, this one is mandatory viewing. Climb up the ladder Shepard just lowered after the vid. This is a point of no return, so you may want to save here before proceeding.
Fortified Ravagers[]
Reapers also know a thing or two about teamwork
Up the ladder is another double-hallway fight. An initial 2 Ravagers, 2 Cannibals and 2 Marauders (one near the Ravagers, one by the stairs nearest to your initial location) are backed up by 2 Barrier Engines nestled between the central support struts, one near you and one further up. When some of them die another 2 Cannibals and 1 Ravager emerge from the far end of the hall, and the room the Ravager comes from has another obscure Barrier Engine that's too hidden from your initial position even with sniper rifles (the Ravager will always get a barrier buff unless you somehow close the distance fast and shoot the Barrier Engine before it does its thing, feasible with a Vanguard or Infiltrator but a real high-risk low-reward scenario).
Warning:  It is fairly common for one of your two squadmates to fail to climb up the ladder into this area, making them unavailable for this fight. It's possible to unglitch them by moving forward into the area, but given the high threat level and close proximity of the enemies here, this is very unsafe. Your only other options are to either accept having only one teammate to assist, or to reload an earlier save and try going up the ladder again to see if you can avoid this glitch.
Move between cover spots, keep your shields up, and keep shooting. Keep in mind that squadmates may often walk straight into Ravager fire, so try to assign them to cover rather than risk them running about. Tip: If you have a penetrating ammo mod or a sniper rifle that comes with it built in, you can shoot the nearest and most dangerous Barrier Engine through the glass without coming under Ravager fire. You may then be tempted to follow up with some headshots to Cannibals, but don't give the Ravagers time to advance to the top of the staircase and trap you. Warning:  Mind the Spore Pods along the south side (to your left from the entrance), they don't disgorge Swarmers but getting caught in acid explosions isn't any better either. The Gestation Pods farther along do spawn Swarmers and they're mixed in with some Spore Pods so also note the distinction, just give them wide berths, or shoot from a distance.
More Cerberus war crimes for the scales of judgment
You'll know everything's dead when the objective changes to ""Search the Perimeter."" There's only a thermal clip box in the first room and nothing else. In the second room is a grenade and clip box, a medical station, research data (3,000 credits), Henry's log explaining the Reapers realized what they're doing and attacked, another log releasing the husks in the inaccessible room (one is identified as a female refugee and still speaks...), and lastly one squadmate goes to the open door on the other side of the room and the other guy shouts it's a way out.
You emerge again at the cavernous hall the command center overlooks, this time on the same level as the overhead platform where the first Banshee came from. Jump across the gap to reach the platform. There's a power box at the front of the tank-object-thing you're standing on, right there on the floor; shoot the panel off and activate it. You may see a bunch of husks prowling or growling about but they won't bother you and you can't kill them anyway. Jump off when you're at the other side of the hall and go through the door. Time to fight again.
Final Battle[]
You nimble enough to evade rampaging Brutes?
The point of no return is when you drop down to the ruined section of the ramp from the door. Before you do so, you are given the opportunity to spy at the far end of the room: a Brute and a Banshee clobbering infrastructure.
Once you drop down, 2 Brutes spawn at the hallway in this last lab area. Similar three-tier battlefield layout as the one you previously fought in, except thankfully no Barrier Engines or exploding pods. Keep moving, but be careful how far you advance: the Brute/Banshee combo is a partial geography trigger, meaning you might fight all of them at once if you run too far up the hallway. If you already killed the first 2 Brutes, the last Brute and Banshee's attention will swing towards your direction regardless of where you are.
Thermal clip locations here are accessible enough, there's a single med kit at the upper tier, and if you use grenades there are pickups on the floor beneath a pod with a husk and another one by the hologram at the far end of the hall, so be careful not to incur the Brute and Banshee's attention if you're not ready.
Tip: It is possible to kill the Brute and Banshee through the glass with a good enough sniper rifle or powers that apply directly to the enemy (Combat Drone, some of the squadmates' powers like EDI's Incinerate and Overload, Liara's Warp, etc.), as soon as you enter the room, before even starting the fight with the two Brutes. Also note there are more places to run and dodge than is obvious at first glance - you are allowed to run on the diagonal glass windows directly to the right of the wrecked platform on which you enter the room, making this effectively a ""three hallway"" battle. Run around to stay at long range as much as possible while taking these enemies down, since they are all most deadly at close range.
Why is there a weapon inside a containment chamber is one of those Mass Effect mysteries that will never be solved. Along with random firecrackers or giftboxes at random locations.
When the fighting dies down one of your squadmates runs up to the elevator the Brute and Banshee were banging their fists on, then returns to you when you see it. Take your time to loot the place first though, there's no rush.
On the long table of workstations next to the elevator, some salvageable research data (4,500 credits). Aside from the combat supplies, the aforementioned hologram can be interacted with. It gives you the option to override a pod in the lab: the easternmost one (to the left, coming from the entrance to the room). Activate it to slide open the glass. Inside is the M-99 Saber.
Confront Henry Lawson[]
Save if you want before entering the elevator, it's the last time to do so on this mission. Just beyond the final door are ominous sounds of a shootout, however no one dies until you proceed.
Henry and Ori in a hostage situation at Sanctuary
You emerge on the topmost floor of the facility, once again overlooking the cavernous hallway where you first came in below. It's cutscene time on the other side, with Henry Lawson holding Oriana hostage. If Miranda is present, she'll be at the standoff as well. The choices you made throughout the previous events regarding the Lawsons' story will all boil down to this scene.
There are multiple potential outcomes:
If you ask about Henry Lawson's legacy, the camera will focus on the cracked glass behind him.
If you can't pass the Reputation check and ""just want Oriana"", you'll have a Renegade Interrupt option to wound her in the leg, distracting Henry:
If Miranda is present, she will slay her father via biotics and Oriana lives.
If Miranda is not present, Shepard can kill Henry with another Renegade Interrupt. Otherwise, Shepard will tell Henry to run away, letting him go.
If you don't take the Renegade Interrupt and Miranda is not present, Oriana will backpedal towards the glass and throw herself and her father down, which ends in both of them dying. If Miranda is present, she'll kill her father, but her father will also mortally wound her.
If you do pass the Reputation check, you'll be able to use a Charm/Intimidate option that gets Henry to release Oriana. If so, you'll get a Renegade option that allows you to kill him. If Miranda's present, she'll take it before you get a chance to.
Miranda's survival requires a specific set of spread-out conditions fulfilled, or in her favorite word, ""perfect""
If Miranda is present, the following conditions will determine whether she dies.
If Miranda wasn't warned about Kai Leng, or if you didn't complete her Loyalty Mission, she'll be gravely injured and die at the end. Warning about Kai Leng requires reading the dossier on the assassin before speaking to Miranda over vidcomm, and completing her Loyalty Mission means you must have at least imported a Mass Effect 2 save.
If you break off a romance with her during Mass Effect 3 she will also die, regardless of whether you did both her loyalty mission and warned her of Kai Leng. Breaking off a romance during Mass Effect 2, even at the very end before importing the save, will not result in her death. A romanced Miranda will also survive if you have ""locked in"" another romance before the apartment scene—only an explicit ""on-camera"" breakup leads to death.
If you deny her access to Alliance resources during your third meeting, or if you never met for the third time on the Citadel, she will die.
Miranda always dies in a game that was not imported from Mass Effect 2.
Note: Miranda may appear wounded in the cutscene, but can still survive.
Whichever Lawson sister you've been chasing will disable the scrambling tower, allowing her warning to pipe out and guarantee that no one gets near Sanctuary. In the meanwhile, one of your squad members manages to salvage a little data to start you on your way to finding the Illusive Man."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Rannoch:_Admiral_Koris,"Prerequisite: Priority: Geth Dreadnought
Admiral Raan reports during the dreadnought after-mission debrief how Zaal'Koris sacrificed his ship to destroy a planetary defense cannon, and Shepard offers assistance. To start the mission, orbit Rannoch and select Quarian Escape Pod/Save the Admiral.","On the shuttle down to Rannoch, Admiral Xen informs you that the Civilian Fleet has taken losses. Without Admiral Koris to guide them, many captains of the Civilian Fleet are planning on breaking from the fleet and risk a run to escape to the Mass Relay. Xen tells you that Koris's escape pod crashed within range of a jamming tower, before communications is cut. Cortez flies towards the pod but is stopped by the AA Guns. You plan to disable the AA guns on foot and then Cortez can destroy the jamming tower, so you can locate Koris. Cortez lands the shuttle from a short distance from the escape pod.
Proceed along the linear pathway until you come to a crashed quarian escape pod. A Geth Trooper and Geth Pyro will be standing with their backs to you. It is possible to flank them by taking a path to the far right side. It seems too close, but hugging the right side will prevent them from noticing you. Notice that if you get close enough carefully, a teammate will shout ""GETH"". Should you prefer a more aggressive approach, you can eliminate the hostiles immediately. Decide on your strategy, and afterward, a squad member will go forth to analyze a dead quarian using their omni-tool. Before proceeding to your main destination, don't forget to salvage the wreckage worth 2,500 credits next to the burning debris, and also make a circular loop around the path on your right to pick up the salvage labeled Geth Parts for 2,500 credits. Proceed along the trail and be careful; there are multiple Geth Trip Mines on the ground. Pick up the Javelin on the ground next to a trip mine before progressing.
You will be moving on an outcropping that overlooks a geth patrol consisting of two Geth Troopers and two Geth Rocket Troopers. Eliminate the hostiles and move down to the second crash site where three Geth Troopers and a Geth Rocket Trooper will drop in. Make short work of them and move forward, watching for more trip mines.
First AA Tower[]
Geth protecting the first AA tower
The path leads to the AA Tower where you will be met with oblivious hostiles: three Geth Troopers, two Geth Rocket Troopers. The moment you begin your attack, several more hostiles will drop from the sky. Once you eliminate the hostiles, salvage Geth Technology worth 3,750 credits at the area entrance directly facing the AA Gun Control. Go to the right near the controls and pick up a Geth Spitfire heavy weapon. Tip: You will probably find this heavy weapon difficult to aim against the fast-moving smaller geth, but it will pound down a big slow Geth Prime better than anything else. You may want to drop it next to you (by switching weapons) at the beginning of the combat, and pick it back up when something big shows up.
Now examine the AA Gun Control and choose one of your squad members to take the AA guns offline. You must defend the position from a wave of geth hostiles including a Geth Prime. Once the hostiles have been eliminated, your squad member will notify you that the AA guns are offline but watch out: a second wave of geth hostiles including two cloaked Geth Hunters will approach your position. Eliminate all hostiles and proceed up the hill grabbing the Assault Rifle Magazine Upgrade and med kit on the left (before the ridge you must cover-climb to get over).
Dorn'Hazt finds comfort in his homeworld's skies
Watch out for a proximity mine. You will come to a clearing with several disabled geth. Pick up a Shotgun Shredder Mod to the left and salvage the Geth Parts for 3,750 credits. Move through the clearing and talk to Dorn'Hazt, a mortally wounded quarian who served on Admiral Koris' ship. Dorn'Hazt reveals that the political situation on the Migrant Fleet is fractious: the Civilian Fleet of the Flotilla did not want to go to war with the geth, and without Admiral Koris guiding them, the civilians may flee the battle. He then directs Shepard toward Koris' location. Continue along the path to the tower picking up the SMG Magazine Upgrade on the way. You can choose to either go left or right at a fork, but the encounter is the same on either side (this walkthrough assumes the right-hand path).
Jamming Tower[]
Move along the path to the right and you will encounter several geth hostiles and a stationary turret. Eliminate all hostiles and move up to examine the AA Gun Control. Near the AA Gun Control is a piece of Armax Arsenal Chestplate. Choose a squadmate to disable the gun. Quickly double back to the station turret and utilize it against an incoming wave of hostiles, which includes another Geth Prime. Tip: The mounted turret is easier to turn and follow targets with if you do NOT utilize the zoom-to-aim feature.
Jamming tower and one of the AA guns
Once all hostiles have been eliminated, a door to the right of the turret leading to the other AA Gun will open. More hostiles will be waiting inside the hallway and around the AA Gun. Eliminate them and before proceeding to the AA Gun Control, head to the left from the hallway exit and at the first highlighted terminal, retrieve the Jamming Tower Data.
Now proceed to examine the AA Gun Control. Choose a squad member to disable the gun, and run back to the stationary turret, as the sooner you get there the less likely you are to be flanked. Defend the area from a wave of geth hostiles - note that on higher difficulties this assault is more numerous than the first turret defense and more likely to quickly flank and endanger your position at the turret: if this happens just pull back to cover nearer the controls. Once all hostiles have been eliminated, your squad mate will notify you that the gun is offline.
Air Support[]
Shepard's squad will then board a shuttle and proceed to contact Admiral Koris, who is engaged in a heavy firefight. He refuses to be saved, telling Shepard to rescue his crew. With sufficient Reputation, however, he can be persuaded to be picked up instead of sacrificing himself. Letting Koris die is costly: Admiral Koris' leadership is lost and, if the quarians survive the entire ordeal, their Civilian Fleet panics without him.
Whatever your choice, you will mount a turret inside the shuttle and provide cover fire for whoever you are rescuing. Though it seems as if the geth are firing at your chosen target, they are in fact aiming for your shuttle; you must either destroy the Rocket Troopers or the missiles they launch in order to survive long enough to evacuate your target. Once that party makes it to the shuttle safely, your mission concludes, and you will be given 12,500 credits."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Despoina:_Leviathan,"Prerequisite: Leviathan: Scan Locations
Scanning 2181 Despoina yields the following text:
“Search Successful: Scans reveal a faint trace of Leviathan's energy signature. Closer examination required for confirmation.”
This mission begins when you land on the planet.","The mission begins onboard the shuttle, where you discuss amongst yourselves how a probe you sent has managed to pinpoint Leviathan's location and how you're supposed to reach it. One of your squadmates will express doubts on bringing Leviathan to aid in the war, and you can answer whichever way you want.
Wait for Shuttle Repairs[]
Another Raft of the Medusa, 2186
While descending on the ocean planet the shuttle will be disabled by a mysterious pulse. Cortez manages to set the shuttle down at one of the floating wrecks littering the ocean for repairs and you will have free rein of exploring the immediate surroundings.
There's a bunch of datapads by the makeshift shelters that tell the grim story of the wreck's crew, along with some items worth picking up for credits (2x pure eezo samples, 2x survey data, star charts - every piece for 2250), an Assault Rifle Omni-Blade, M-55 Argus, and a Pistol Cranial Trauma System by a seaside cranny near the shelters. There are also two Med Kits on this half of the wreck. You will also see mysterious spherical artifacts inside some of the shacks and containers; you can destroy them with your guns, but there's no gameplay or story impact for doing so.
Defend the Shuttle[]
When the most sensitive guy in your crew is packing, you know it's serious
A short interval after coming down the ledge from the Kodiak, one of your squadmates points at something in the sky. A Sovereign-class Reaper is descending; enemy foot soldiers start pouring in: Husks, Cannibals, and Marauders. They will initially deploy from the opposite end of the area from the shuttle, but will later drop all along the water's edge, so stay alert for flankers. Be especially wary of the two Brutes who arrive toward the end. Deal with them until Cortez manages to complete repairs and starts providing air support.
It turns out Cortez cannot stay airborne for long due to being hit again by the pulse so he lands the shuttle at the other side of the wreck. There is a mining equipment salvage (1,500 credits) just past the part where you have to leap across. Deal with the enemies, then go over and talk to Cortez for the next part of the mission. If you haven't managed to get all items in the first pass due to having been interrupted by the Reapers' arrival, now is the chance to backtrack and get everything missed. There's a Pistol Ultralight Materials mod in another nook by the ocean, near the tarp closest to Cortez. Don't forget to take note of the M-560 Hydra by the supply stashes behind Cortez, the med kit, and the Kodiak. Don't pick it up yet: save it for later.
Restore Power[]
Knowledge of the terrain is useful
You ask Cortez for the Kodiak's status and he replies that it's inoperable. One of your squadmates suggests pickup by the Normandy, and Cortez points out the same thing will happen to the ship. Since it's impossible to go airborne or be rescued until the problem goes away you will resolve on pressing forward: find Leviathan.
Cortez suggests using the Triton ADS mech stored inside a section of the wreck. You are initially skeptical, and your squadmates are even more so, but you quickly accept this as it's the only real option. Since the door to the Triton is sealed, you need to get it open first. To that end, several power sockets are scattered throughout the wreck and Cortez suggests using the shuttle's power cells to give the necessary juice for opening the door.
Reaper forces start landing en masse again. You gain a backpack containing the power cells and you have to bring them to the sockets, stay alive while the cells are being loaded, and come back to Cortez for more until the door finally comes open (unlike characters in multiplayer, Shepard is capable of sprinting and rolling while carrying the pack and will not drop it). One of the sockets is near the bay door itself, and another is at the seaward side of the wreck in front of the door.
You face a multifold problem here: the energy in the sockets is slowly dissipating, necessitating the need to finish as quickly as possible, and you will face lots of resistance between grabbing the cells from Cortez to the sockets. A good time to use the Hydra is when you're nearing the 100% mark and there are Brutes in the way - a panic weapon, if you will.
Each time you get an energy cell, the game autosaves. Do not pick up the Hydra unless you need it. If you pick it up and drop it for later, it may disappear if you load an autosave.
When you plug in a cell at a socket, wait and watch the socket. If it closes or if Cortez calls you, go back to Cortez for another cell. Otherwise, you may have to use another socket, in which case you might as well just use the same one.
Kill Enemies[]
Once you get the door open you must use the Triton to clear out the enemies: Reapers keep falling if you insist on taking them out conventionally. You may think you've cleared out a ""wave"", but the Reaper overhead will simply drop others to replace what you've killed. The Triton handles like an Atlas, able to fire both a cannon and rockets as well as perform a melee attack. Hordes of Brutes will spawn to test the Triton's mettle so be ready accordingly. You can still issue move orders to your squad while piloting the mech, which you should do to keep them away from the Brutes' claws.
When the enemies are dealt with, walk the mech over to Cortez so he can run a systems check on it.
Into the Deep[]
One of the wonders of future tech is that they're waterproof
When Cortez proclaims the mech ready to go, you have a choice between diving immediately or holding off first. Now is the absolute last chance to go through any items that may have been missed if you choose to procrastinate. In the section where the Triton was stored, you can find some salvaged xenotechnology worth 2250 credits. You can always talk to Cortez whenever you are ready. Once you make the decision to dive, your squadmates will express their reservations, including your affirmed love interest if you have one.
Partway through the dive you begin to lose contact with Cortez on the surface—some kind of interference is cutting you off. You spend the remainder of the mission alone on the bottom of the ocean. Take time to enjoy the surroundings, the Triton helpfully fires flares in order for you to find your way around.
Keep going down until you come across the probe you sent earlier. If the depth reading on your HUD is around 3200+ meters, you're very close. Walk the mech over to it, then it shoots another flare in the distance. A rumble issues from the chasm not far from you, go to it and prepare to meet Leviathan.
The entity you're talking to details its reasons for staying clear of the war. It gives you an outline of its race's history and you can ask it questions critical to the story. When that's done the Leviathan declares that you must remain with them while the Reapers harvest the rest. It's your job as Commander Shepard to convince it otherwise, and it will accept due to its own reasons.
Despite what this looks like, they're not making out
You engage the Triton's emergency boosters for the ascent and on the surface you see the fruits of your conversation with the Leviathan: a Brute turns against another and starts messing with other Reaper forces. While you escape in the repaired shuttle the Reaper shows up trying to block your path when a ship-disabling pulse hits the Reaper, causing it to crash into the ocean.
Back aboard the shuttle, you wake up and your concerned squadmates ask you what happened down in the depths. If you have an affirmed love interest with you, they will be almost frantic with worry. If Ann Bryson survived her ordeal with Leviathan relatively unharmed, you will converse with her over the shuttle's comm to end the mission."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Kite%27s_Nest:_Pillars_of_Strength,"Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel I
Listen to the batarian preacher who is standing near the entrance of Cargo Hold C in the Docks: Holding Area.
You can also acquire the mission and the artifact on conducting a Search and Rescue operation in the Kite's Nest cluster. This second way of acquisition is possible even before the docks become available on the Citadel. In this case, its journal entry name is Citadel: Pillars of Strength. Once you hear the preacher talk about the artifact on the way back, however, the mission name and journal text revert back to the first one.","Unlike the mad prophet on Omega this guy is actually reasonable
In the Harsa system, scan the batarian homeworld of Khar'shan, the second planet. Head back to the Citadel and talk to the batarian preacher, who will reward you for your efforts and thank you for restoring faith to his people.
Note:  while the pillars can be retrieved as soon as you get free rein over the Normandy, you cannot hand them over to the preacher until after Priority: Palaven. The refugee area only becomes available after that mission.
Getting the pillars back to the preacher gives you 15,000 credits, 5 Reputation, and updates the Batarian Fleet War Asset."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Priority:_The_Citadel_I,"Prerequisite: Priority: Mars
Available once the plot mission on Mars has been completed.","Note: Completion of this mission only hinges on you going to the Citadel Council to discuss your findings. Everything else is optional, but since you're already on the Citadel and some events may not be available afterward, you might as well follow the directions below for completion.
A series of cutscenes shows the Normandy arriving at the Citadel. Liara, James, and Shepard look on as the critically injured Ashley or Kaidan gets carted off by a group of medical personnel to Huerta Memorial Hospital for emergency treatment. Shortly afterwards, a newly-promoted Armando-Owen Bailey shows up to welcome the Commander and inform them that the Council is extremely busy, but to head to Councilor Donnel Udina's office in the Citadel Embassies when Shepard's ready to speak with them. Liara says she'll head there immediately, while Bailey suggests that Shepard should have time to visit the hospital to check on Kaidan or Ashley if they want to. James also splits off on his own.
Allers attempting to conduct an interview
After the conversation ends, you regain control and find yourself in the viewing lounge of Normandy Dock: Bay D24. You can talk to journalist Diana Allers, who is attempting to pry information out of Ensign Copeland, a member of your crew. She wants to join the crew of the Normandy, and will be a war asset if you grant her request. You can talk to Avina before going through the security checkpoint and using the elevator; near the hologram, an anxious conversation between an asari and her turian bondmate can be overheard.
At this point in the game, the elevator can only take you to 3 locations: the docking bay (where you currently are), the hospital, and the embassies. Other locations will unlock on your next return to the Citadel. If you travel to Huerta Memorial Hospital, you will find Doctor Chakwas if she survived the Suicide Mission. You can invite her to rejoin the Normandy's crew at this time. If you tell her to stay in the labs, you will have the option of bringing Dr. Chloe Michel on board and also gain Dr. Chakwas as a war asset. Also note that you can simply ignore Michel and/or Chakwas for the time being; however, if you want a ship's doctor, one of them must be chosen before Priority: Tuchanka at the absolute latest.
At the Sirta Supplies console, you are able to purchase additional medi-gel capacity and also a gift for Ashley or Kaidan. There is also another Avina terminal with some additional information on the hospital facilities. There are many ambient conversations you can listen to at the hospital; behind the main desk you can eavesdrop on a conversation between a therapist and an asari patient who appears to have experienced traumatic events. You can also check with Dr. Michel about the status of Ashley/Kaidan. Continue on through the next two doors and open the door on the right to visit your former crewmate. Once you are finished, return back to the elevator.
Take the elevator to Citadel Embassies, exit, and talk to Avina to learn more about the area. Turn left and find a volus diplomat to pick up the Shrike Abyssal: Prothean Obelisk mission. Return back down the hall and around the corner past the desk and up the stairs. Turn left to enter the C-Sec office and check in with Commander Bailey. After he boots out Khalisah al-Jilani and you've had your first discussion with him, you can have another one for investigative purposes and learn some more about the Citadel and Bailey in general.
Al-Jilani can be found at the lobby afterwards, standing near Avina, and you can talk to her. She is a potential war asset. There will be opportunities for Paragon or Renegade interrupts in your conversation for corresponding morality rewards.
Back in the hall, find the next door on the left to check out the Spectre Office. At the end of the left corridor is the Spectre Requisitions store, and the Spectre Console where you get status information and perform various Spectre-related tasks throughout the game. The door on the right will take you into the Firing Range, where you can modify your weapons with upgrades and test out their effectiveness on three different targets, one each for shields, armour, and health.
The main destination for this mission is the Earth Councilor's Office, where Udina resides. Go there if you have no more pressing issues to attend to. An asari assistant greets you and leads you to the Council Chambers where you find Liara already meeting with the councilors, including Udina. Things do not look promising: while the non-human Council members don't dismiss the Prothean weapon out of hand, they are skeptical and don't agree to aid in its construction. Worse still, they are all firmly against committing military aid to Earth with their own worlds at risk; respond to them how you wish, but it will be to no avail.
""They're a bunch of self-concerned jackasses, Shepard. We may have a spot on the Council, but humanity will always be considered second-rate.""
The meeting adjourned, you and Udina return to his office. The Turian Councilor enters at a somewhat awkward moment and informs you that the turians have lost contact with their leader, Primarch Fedorian, who was preparing to call a war summit; the councilor would like you to rescue him. You have the opportunity to respond somewhat cynically if you're feeling generous, or very cynically if you're in a more spiteful mood. If your Spectre status was not restored in the previous game, it will be restored here. Talk to Udina again if you're the inquisitive type.
When you return to the lobby, James will be looking out a window to the right of the elevator, and you can discuss his feelings about leaving Earth and about the Citadel. If you've had enough of the station for now, depart for the Normandy.
Shepard's dreamscape
When you return to the ship, a dream sequence ensues. Finding yourself in a dead, bleak forest, you see the child you met on Earth running away. Pursue him. You finally reach him, only to see him engulfed in flames as you try to save him. Alternatively, do nothing for a while, and you'll still eventually see the sequence of the kid being burned.
You wake up to a knock at your cabin door from Liara, who notices that something is bothering you. Your conversation is eventually interrupted by new Comm Specialist Samantha Traynor, who gives you a rundown of some of the features of the Alliance-revamped Normandy SR-2, including the new war room in the CIC where Admiral Hackett is waiting to debrief you on your meeting with the Council. Note that your conversations with Traynor and Liara do not reward any morality points, but the talk with Hackett does.
Afterwards, you'll finally have free rein of the Normandy. Be sure to check your private terminal and get acquainted with the crew. When you are ready, go to the CIC and fire up the Galaxy Map for your choice of next destination."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Priority:_Palaven,Prerequisite: Priority: The Citadel I,"Hot Landing Zone[]
From absolute left to right: H-K greaves, Pistol Piercing Mod, AA shoulder guard, Pistol Magazine Upgrade, Assault Rifle Piercing Mod, Scimitar
The Kodiak will fly over the camp, opening its doors in mid-flight. Accurate players will be able to shoot husks off the cliff, severely reducing the amount of enemies when you land. Clear them all out and talk to the turian soldier to get directions. Scan the spare parts on the right just past the soldier for 1250 credits. Before continuing down the path, climb up to the building you see in front of you, and walk up to the edge. Liara and James will have a brief dialogue about the Reaper in the distance. Continue up the path and pass through the gate. On the left is a med kit (100 XP). Just ahead in the center of the base is a datapad (1875 credits) and the M-97 Viper; to the right of those in the structure is another datapad (75 XP).
Go forward from the datapad to the end of the encampment and turn left to see a barrier exit/entryway similar to the one you came through when first entering the camp. Going towards it, on your left will be a piece of metal cover where you can pick up the M-27 Scimitar and the Assault Rifle Piercing Mod. In the nearby enclosure on your left when turning around from these items, you will find the Hahne-Kedar Greaves, a datapad (75 XP), and another med kit (100 XP). Head back towards General Corinthus. In an enclosure on the left you can find a Pistol Piercing Mod, the Armax Arsenal Shoulder Guard, and a Weapon Bench. Finally, in the alcove between you and the general will be another datapad (2,500 credits) and a Pistol Magazine Upgrade.
Comm Tower[]
After picking everything up, talk to General Corinthus. He will tell you that the Primarch is already dead. You need to repair the comm tower in order to communicate with Palaven Command, and learn who the new Primarch is. Head out the back left of the base to where some turian guards will tell you they were overwhelmed by husks while trying to retake the comm tower. Eight husks will now attack you as you approach the tower, but if you return to the turians instead of moving toward the comm tower immediately the turians will help you fend off the husks. Do note that the turian's gunfire will harm Shepard if the Commander is standing in the way, so stay out of their line of fire.
This ""battle"" takes all of two seconds to complete
Once the husks are down, head over to the comm tower, where you will have to choose one squadmate to repair the comm tower, while you and the other member defend the position from waves of husks. You'll be facing twenty-eight more husks, without much help, so choose a squadmate remain with you: Liara provides crowd control with Singularity, but James can lay down a lot of damage and can survive melees with husks for longer. Make your choice, and then get ready to fight. One key to survival here is to keep moving - remember that you can always outrun the husks, and that the only truly fatal mistake is to become trapped by them. So run and gun when necessary, and eventually about halfway through your second squadmate will announce the tower is fixed. Shepard will now volunteer to help Corinthus' men with the rest of the husks: you will still have more husks to fight through, but now you have both squadmates, and the turians will reappear on the slopes overlooking the tower to lend a hand. After the rest of the husks are down, Corinthus will call and ask you to return to the base.
Note:  If you don't want to help fight the husks, you can simply run straight back to Corinthus, as he will call you to return as soon as you reach the base gate, allowing you to bypass the rest of the fight. However, husks will soon start dropping randomly in your path, which can deal heavy damage to you.
At this point your old squadmate Garrus Vakarian will make his first appearance, provided he survived Mass Effect 2, or if you are starting a Mass Effect 3 game from scratch without importing a save. Corinthus will inform you that General Adrien Victus is next in line to become the primarch, and that you have to find him.
Joker will then interrupt, saying that the Normandy's systems are malfunctioning. If Garrus is alive and present, Liara will leave the squad to investigate and he will take her place in your present squad, otherwise Shepard promises to look into the Normandy's malfunctions after the mission. Liara will then stay and fills in for some of Garrus' lines throughout the mission.
Note:  If you took any health damage during the fight at the comm tower, you will be back to full health after this interlude.
Note:  If Liara's Warp Ammo was applied to any of your squad's weapons, it will appear to still be active if she leaves your party, but this is purely a misleading visual effect and it is no longer actually doing anything. You can (and should) activate any other ammo powers your team may possess.
Airfield and Barricade[]
Jamesbusters feat. an Assault Rifle Mag Upgrade beside him
You will be sent out to defend the airfield from Reaper forces made up of more husks and now Marauders. Remember to pick up the Assault Rifle Magazine Upgrade next to the waist-high barriers and the supplies on top of the crates to the right (2500 credits) as you won't be returning to this area.
Note:  Your squadmates can sometimes fail to follow you into this area before the gate shuts, trapping them outside during the fight. It's a good idea to manually order them into the area before you go in.
Following this, Corinthus will need you to defend the main barricade. You will encounter a few waves of husks, but you'll have access to a mounted turret with which they can be taken out quickly.
Tip: It is possible to zoom your view while using a mounted gun. Also, while turrets have unlimited ammo, they need to reload every so often, and they are more accurate when fired in short bursts (the first shot is always perfectly aligned with the crosshair).
As soon as you take out the waves of husks, you will be forced off of the turret and outside of the base's walls by a Brute supported by a small group of husks. If you're playing through for the first time and have never faced a Brute, there are two important things to remember. One is to stay as far away from the Brute as possible as it uses powerful melee attacks and charges, so you will want to dodge and create distance whenever possible by sprinting and using combat rolls. The second thing to remember is that the Brute possesses armor plates that protect many areas of it from most standard bullets. Shoot it accurately in the head or its unprotected buttocks when it lunges past you; powers like Incinerate and fire or biotic Power Combos are also effective.

Down the Long Path[]
Sniper Rifle Spare Ammo mod. Oh, and a turian cruiser disintegrating.
With the Reaper forces neutralized, proceed along the path. After following Garrus around the corner to the right, keep going straight until you see a turian frigate in the distance. James will make a few comments here about the frigate and the Reaper in the distance. Continue to General Victus' last known location. Pick up a datapad on the ground next to some dead turians (1,875 credits) after the visual cue for Garrus to comment on Palaven. On the way, defend against a few husks which will climb up the cliff wall to attack from both in front and behind you. When you get to the soldiers, you will find a med kit (100 XP), another datapad (2,500 credits), and a Sniper Rifle Spare Thermal Clip. Move up to the view of the crashed frigate to have a short dialogue with James and Garrus. Continue ahead to see an aircraft crash into the rocks in front of you. Examine the crash site to learn that there are no survivors. Move along, listening to the exposition, and pick up the med kit (100 XP).
Rescue Victus[]
Sniper Rifle Enhanced Scope at the lower left, Blackstar by the crates at center-right. Victus is at the top-center end of this image and your squad comes in from the right.
Soon you will see an explosion. Run over there and you'll be met by a group of Cannibals and Marauders, followed by more Cannibals and a Brute. Use the crater as cover and let the enemy come to you. Once they are clear, move further into the compound and look to the right. Marauders and a pair of Brutes appear. But on the right as you come in, just past the first turian ""bunker"" is a most useful Reaper Blackstar heavy weapon; use it as you wish because this is the last fire-fight. Its immense explosion can take out one or both of the Brutes instantly. Beware that although you will suffer no splash damage, your squadmates can often be caught in the deadly blast. Tip: Another opportunity related to this being the final firefight - use up the rest of James' grenades freely, and your own if Shepard is carrying any.
After the battle, search the area for mods: in this area, directly to the left from where you picked up the Blackstar, you can find a med kit (50 XP). Turn around and face the bunker that is on fire. Head towards it to find another med kit (50 XP), and a Sniper Rifle Enhanced Scope on the far left as you come in. After eliminating all the Reaper forces and acquiring the mod, approach the final ramp or climb up on the plateau to trigger the conversation with General Victus and end the mission. Warning:  Try not to finish the battle near General Victus if you have not picked up the mod, or the end conversation may trigger automatically without you being able to look around the battlefield after.
You will then return to the Normandy and converse with the asari Councilor and Admiral Hackett."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/N7:_Cerberus_Attack,"Prerequisite: Priority: Sur'Kesh
After the mission on Sur'Kesh, Specialist Samantha Traynor mentions in passing that information pertaining to Cerberus activity on Tuchanka has been acquired.","Travel to the Krogan DMZ to the planet Tuchanka, and select the Cerberus attack site. Select your team and Hackett will brief you on the way down in the shuttle.
Strategy Tip: You may find that a more proactive strategy is effective in this mission—pushing aggressively towards your current map objective will result in far fewer enemies spawning overall than a more cautious ""let them come"" approach.
Note:  During this first part of the mission, Cerberus will be firing the big cannon up into space to clear a path for its incoming cruiser, causing the ground to shake occasionally and mess with your aim. This problem will cease once you've secured the control room for the cannon, your first objective.
Wide-open spaces and lots of cover
Enemies will already be present at the location when you land, but they will not yet be aware of you. When you walk around the corner there will be three Troopers with their backs to you—make the most of this opportunity. Now get in cover, preferably in a spot where you can see the large open courtyard, as a large wave of Troopers, Centurions and Engineers will now attack. Be especially wary of any Turrets the Engineers may set up inside the control room for the cannon, as they can be difficult to see behind low walls and the copious smoke the Centurions lay down. It is a good idea to avoid climbing the ladder into the room as it might just put you face to face with a Turret.
Keep fighting until Shepard says the console has been secured, at which point there will be no more enemies left and you're safe to save your game and collect all the loot on the map before activating the console.
From where you started, go a little left and through the door. Go past the pile of rubble and in the corner to the left of the crate you will find some junk to salvage (3,000 credits). Return back to where you started and go right, across the courtyard (where the enemies were coming from), and instead of going up the ramp, go to the right. Approach the ammo and you will find some more junk to salvage (+3500 credits).
Climb up the ladder and move toward the console with all the holograms on it. While standing behind the console, look left and you'll see the ""Old Grid Schematics"" icon needed for the Citadel: Improved Power Grid mission. From that position, to your left will be a med-kit on the ground. Head down the ramp (beyond the hologram counter) directly ahead of you out of the control room, and move into the corner on the right (a bit hidden) for more salvageable junk (3,500 credits).  Finally, move around the fallen column and on the other side, pick up the Armax Arsenal Gauntlets.
Reactivate Power[]
You'll have to plow through quite a few of these guys
When you're done collecting loot, go back up the ramp, and activate the control console. Cerberus will cut power to the console, so you need to reactivate the power. All of the enemies in this wave spawn from a long distance off and will tend to approach you across the open courtyard, so either the window of the control room or the landing outside the upper doorway both make excellent defensive positions. Note that the only Nemesis in the mission spawns at this point, dropping along with a Centurion from a shuttle onto the bridge-like platform above the main area, and catching her in this vulnerable spot before she manages to take cover down below is a fine idea.
Hold out until the enemies stop coming; after you've killed maybe 10 or more Cerberus will brilliantly realize that something is wrong, declaring ""we've got resistance here"" and pulling back. At that point head back across the courtyard to where you started, because both the power modules are there. Once you are there, you will find, at minimum, one last pair (a Centurion and a Trooper) hunkered down near one of the power modules.
Once all the enemies are down, you have another peaceful chance to look around for any equipment and credits you didn't collect. When you're ready to continue, shoot the latch off both modules and reactivate them.
Note:  Certain weapons, such as the Acolyte pistol, may have difficulty damaging the latches due to their abnormal firing mode. Careful ricochets to cause the detonations in very close proximity to the latch can still open the latches, but this can be very challenging. As powers and melee attacks cannot damage the latches, it is recommended to bring a standard kinetic firearm along on this mission.
Back to the Console[]
Return to the courtyard and fight past the enemies again: this time some Guardians will show up in addition to the enemy types you've already faced. Your goal is to reach the control console again and activate it. Activating it will require you to successfully complete a brief ""progress bar"", and you will then need to stay alive for a few moments longer (ideally go outside and watch the big guns fire), but otherwise activating the console is sufficient to achieve victory regardless of any enemies left standing, so it's your choice whether to work your way through all the approximately 35 enemies in order to approach the console safely, or try to distract Cerberus and do a surgical strike. An Infiltrator can definitely do a quarterback sneak for the win here, but as before, be wary of any Turrets.
Once you activate the console, Cortez will tell you that the Cerberus cruiser is starting bombardment. He will then give you the coordinates of the cruiser and the big guns will automatically shoot it down, though if you're outside at the time you can watch them fire and see the explosion. The mission will automatically end once the Cerberus cruiser breaks up in orbit."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Aria:_Blood_Pack,"Prerequisite: Priority: Palaven
Speak to Aria at the Purgatory on the Citadel.","Aria will tell you to meet with her batarian contact, Narl, on the Presidium Commons. Go to Apartment 86. Narl explains to Shepard that he told the Blood Pack he's turning the Commander over to Kreete, a vorcha Blood Pack leader, but Narl also adds that this is a lie.
Narl, Kreete, Gryll
The real goal is to lure the Blood Pack out since Kreete is planning to betray Aria. Narl needs Shepard to play along and pretend to be captured. You can respond positively or negatively to this request for mandatory morality points (2 Paragon or 2 Renegade), but either way you'll end up going along with it.
Then three vorcha arrive, one of whom is Kreete. As they are about to seal the deal, Narl reveals that the deal is between Aria and Gryll, to Kreete's surprise. Gryll, who's next-in-line to assume leadership, confirms the deal and orders the kill on Kreete. Shepard and Narl will then shoot Kreete and the unnamed vorcha present. After the kill, Shepard advises Gryll not to double-cross Aria. He agrees, stating he's ambitious, but not crazy.
At this point the mission is complete and your Terminus Fleet War Asset will be updated. You are also awarded 210 experience, 5,000 credits, 5 Reputation points, and the aforementioned morality points."

At this point, you are able to head immediately to the Pylos Nebula to search for Ann, though you may want to narrow down the search and/or earn some easy experience points. Head back downstairs to look for clues. One of the datapads will reveal Project Scarab, which Ann heads, requisitioned the MSV Icarus: use this information on the computer console to obtain the Ship Schematics filter.
Go back to the room with the artifact and search the drawer by the husk head. Use the access card to open the equipment locker, which contains an Assault Rifle Omni-Blade weapon mod and enough clues to determine the Equipment filter.
Activating both filters will pinpoint the system in which Ann is located.
Travel to the Zaherin system of the Pylos Nebula and scan near the planet Namakli. After EDI identifies a signal, select the planet and scan for an anomaly. You will then be able to land on the planet, leading to the next mission."

This one has noticed your rise on the leaderboards. It is certain you did not beat this one's score through legitimate play. No human has done so without illicit performance enhancements.

This one knows how you have avoided detection. Your medi-gel contains blood oxygenators to combat fatigue. This one thinks if you entered a match without medi-gel, you would get a metaphorical foot covering lodged in your posterior. This one dares you to enter the simulator with such a restriction--otherwise it will tell its acquaintances you are a consumable flightless bird.

Then simply set a match against any enemy and difficulty with the modifier and complete the combat simulation.

After considerable argument, it concedes that your vital signs never smoothed out as if performance enhancers were used.

Now this one is wondering if you would enjoy a correspondence about tactical circumstances. It has found getting kill streaks on the Reaper super elites challenging.

The mission is automatically awarded once you regain control back at the Personal Apartment.","Shepard orders Brooks and EDI to check the drives for anything useful. Talk to your squadmates to pass the time. They are in the same locations as last time, only with EDI and Liara switched. Once you are ready, talk to Brooks to proceed.
Tip: Before talking to Brooks you may want to take a moment to customize your armor and check your weapon loadout on the second floor of your apartment. You can now equip the M-11 Suppressor that you picked up during Citadel Wards: Ambush (it will be equipped by default).
5 minutes delivery or the next one is free
EDI and Brooks discover a communication a few days ago, and once Brooks cracks it, she opens the file. On it is a series of purchases—weapons, and big ones. Mechs are part of the included package. Glyph then interrupts to say that Shepard’s Spectre access code was just used at the Citadel Archives. One squadmate (Garrus, or Liara if he's dead) claims it's so restrictive they weren't able to gain clearance to enter there despite ostensibly having the means or authority to do so. As Shepard orders everyone to gear up, they find a volus with a pizza. James apparently got the munchies. Double Pepperoni.
Brooks then mentions that it is sad that you can’t bring everyone, but Shepard says why not? As everyone around the room audibly clear their throats, the pizza delivery volus also chimes in. Apparently someone needs to pay the bill.

Citadel Archives: Escape"
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/N7:_Fuel_Reactors,"Prerequisite: Priority: Geth Dreadnought
The mission becomes available after the geth dreadnought's destruction.","As you enter the facility, you start near a turian member of Captain Lee Riley's team who introduces himself as Corporal Nyrek. You can speak to him a few times, and if you do you'll get a bit of background information. Walk to the left to pick up a Rosenkov Materials Chestplate. Then walk farther up to pick up a datapad containing a Medical Treatment Plan.
Radioactive Gas[]
Green radioactive gas that can overcome the shielding on spacesuits
After that, head towards the right side of the facility to speak to Captain Riley herself, and she will explain the situation. A container behind her will be moved to reveal a corridor. Do not attempt to go near the left edge as the area below is filled with deadly gas. On your right, you will come across a Crane Display terminal but before activating it, walk along the same corridor and salvage spare parts worth 4000 credits.
Activate the crane and a display will appear. The display shows a live video feed which is recording from behind you. You will need to use the 3 buttons to move 2 containers, which are displayed on the left of the screen, to the right. Note - the crane begins already holding the first crate.
Once the path is cleared, Riley will then get into position, sending you to go find a way to vent the area. From the Crane Display, follow the path all the way around to your right. There will be a control console to vent the glowing gas.  After activating it, head to the area that just opened up. You can find a PDA next to the Fuel Rod Control for 3000 credits, and a medkit in the same area far back by the yellow vehicle.
Barrier Engines[]
One inactive barrier engine obscured by the glare of lights
Tip: Before initiating the controls, you could walk around the area, look for 6 Reaper Barrier Engines and destroy them; this will tip the coming battles to your favor. Some are overhead, some are at eye level, and one is even cleverly hidden down in the lower area on the far side. They will not be directly targetable, but you can manually aim at them to attack them.
Starting from the fuel rod control, look back towards the direction of the crane controls that you had used earlier. Attached to the top of the support column there is the first barrier engine. Now look towards the direction of the area where you initially started the mission, and you will see a second barrier engine nestled near the foot of the ramp leading back up to that initial starting area. Finally, head towards that same ramp, and you will see a third barrier engine attached to a horizontal beam directly above the top of the ramp.
The next set of engines could be found by following the upper-level walkway from the control console that you used to vent the toxic gas. Eventually, on your right, you will see a barrier engine perched atop a black cylindrical machine. Now turn your head towards the reactor core, and between the two bright lights, you will see another barrier engine. Climb down the ladder to find, tucked away at the foot of the ramp, the final barrier engine.
Return to the fuel rod control and unlock the fuel rods. Husks and Marauders will now attack. After you have cleared the area, you will need to seal the two moderator tanks.
Restart the Reactors[]
Near the reactor controls is another pad with 3000 credits. Next, restart the reactor. After you so do, more enemies will attack. Husks will come from the ground, but Marauders will drop in from above. If you couldn't find the Barrier Engines before, you'll be able to find them now, and you may need to destroy them to make your enemies less durable.
Once the area is clear, Riley will talk to you over comm and say how they are not going to make it. You can choose to help or ask her to keep at it. You will be required to send a squad member if you choose to help.
Brute + 2 barrier engines = pain
Now the chamber door in front of you will be opened, only to reveal Marauders and a Brute, along with two barrier engines inside the reactor chamber that you couldn't reach before. You'll want to draw the Brute out away from the barrier engines so that it doesn't get continual recharges. Once you dispatch the enemies, initiate the final startup on the console. Go straight down to the extraction point.
If you sent a squad member to assist Riley's team, she'll be waiting at the extraction point along with your squad member and one other survivor. If you didn't send backup, you will meet only a wounded Corporal Nyrek, who will inform you that Captain Riley gave her life to save him. Nyrek vows to honor his captain's memory by ""kicking ass."" Pick up any missed items before you hit the door to return to the Normandy."

There is a doorway to Building 6 on the right hand side. Go through this and head all the way to the end of the building.

The building is directly behind you when you approach the computer which raised the lift with the Prothean Artifact on it.
After raising the artifact head towards the main complex of buildings. Go into the first building (building 5) on the left hand side. Head to the end of the building and go through the doorway to the right, into the next room. On the left hand side is the terminal with the second piece of intel.
In front of you from the doorway you came in through, you can see you're on the second story. In front of you is a building with the number 2 on the side with a ladder heading up to the roof. Go through the door of that building turn right and head down the length of the building. Go past a body of a trooper on the floor and stop before you come to the closed door. The terminal you are after is on your left on the center console of three.
Intel Pieces[]
Processing Update


The orange screen in the building has the intelWe've taken more able-bodied men and women from pacified neighborhoods. The colonists generally have accepted the story that they have gone to perform tedious but safe manual labor in a Cerberus research camp on the other side of the planet, and when we increased food rations as ""payment for the work,"" most of the complaints died out.

Maintain the story as long as possible. We don't have the manpower to fight the entire colony, and if these families knew they were never going to see their sons and daughters again, there's no way they'd cooperate.

Troop Deployment Update


The back end of this building labeled '5' houses the second intelLocal resistance is heavy in the south and west sections of the colony. We've pulled most of our troops from the north neighborhoods to assist. All remaining troops in the north neighborhood: continue standard patrol activities to maintain the illusion of a large presence in that area. If the locals knew we were understaffed, they could do some serious damage.

Resistance Information Update


To the rightmost end inside this building labeled '2' is the third intelWe've gotten word from our source within Eden Prime's resistance movement that we can expect an attack on our security center between 2200 and 2300 tomorrow night. They're pulling in forces from across the colony--this gives us the perfect chance to destroy their leadership.

Once the attack is contained, allow Dr. William Cambiata to escape, firing near-miss shots to keep it realistic. He's given us good information, and with luck, the locals will see him as a daring hero and the only man to escape the Cerberus trap. They might even put him in charge!"

If you never heard from Dellk in his corner of the Embassies, the ciphers and the mission's journal entry can be acquired directly at Ontarom.","The encryption algorithms are at a terminal on the mission N7: Communication Hub, which becomes available only after Priority: Thessia.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel_Wards:_Ambush,"Prerequisite: Citadel: Shore Leave
Your conversation with Joker immediately devolves into a shootout upon arrival of uninvited armored guests at Ryuusei's Sushi Bar.","There's a mercenary in my soup
Shepard's inquiry about the situation is interrupted when several armed mercenaries stroll into the bar, and one knocks the host unconscious. They proceed to fire their weapons at the ceiling, causing the restaurant patrons to panic and scatter. Shepard grabs Joker, pulls him down, and flips the table over for cover.
Brooks hides behind another table, but one of the mercenaries finds and drags her away. Shepard orders Joker to get the crew while the Commander goes after Brooks. When Joker starts moving away, one of the mercenaries notices him and moves closer to the overturned table. Shepard grabs the enemy and uses a heavy melee to kill him; Joker then complains about being used as bait but makes an escape. Shepard recovers the mercenary's pistol, an M-11 Suppressor, and tells Brooks to hold on; now the fun begins.
Weight penalty: If you are playing a New Game+ and previously acquired the M-11 Suppressor, you may notice the pistol appears to have reset to Level I for this mission. That's actually because the Suppressor Shepard carries in this mission is a unique model of the weapon that exists in this mission only. This unique model Suppressor has another ""hidden"" feature: it has a very large weight penalty, much larger than most normal weapons. This essentially works as a handicap during this mission, slowing down Shepard's power recharge times. The only real way to mitigate this is to customize Shepard's class power for maximum possible weight capacity prior to this mission. Classes with a weight capacity value of 50 will have a Power Recharge Bonus from weapon loadout of only +80%.
Find Brooks[]
Because you are outnumbered and without armor or squadmates, use cover as much as possible. The pair coming around from your left is the greatest initial danger, as the ones in the bar will tend to hit obstructions if they try to throw grenades at you. Their grenades can scatter shrapnel in a wide area, so be cautious. Feel free to respond with your own grenades if you have them.
The mercenaries will deploy Disruption Drones, which will charge at you and then self-destruct, overloading your shields; take them down before they can do that. The mercenaries and drones also all have shields. This initial wave of enemies will test your shield-stripping capabilities.
Tip: The drones will be a constant nuisance in this mission, but there are some tricks for dealing with them. They don't track you once they stop and beep right before their suicide attack, so simply sidestepping or rolling out of the way will avoid damage. If you don't have room to do this safely, the drones don't damage health, only your shields, so if your shields are down simply take the hit if you have to rather than letting them flush you out of cover to get shot.
Unless you're an Infiltrator, sneaking past these mercs is a pointless exercise despite the game telling you to do so
Fortunately, the M-11 Suppressor in your hands does superb damage and features the highest headshot modifier in the game. Its major downside in this mission is just lack of ammo, but even on Insanity difficulty it can kill an unshielded enemy with one headshot.
Since the goal here is to revive Brooks and not to survive the infinitely spawning enemies, it's recommended that you make a beeline for her once the area is mostly cleared OR during the few seconds you'll have before the enemy forces are even aware of your existence. If you approach by climbing over the bar counters in succession, you will always have cover from any new mercenaries who spawn on the staircase. Infiltrators can cloak and run straight around the bar to tag Brooks right away at the beginning of the fight. Vanguards may also want to Charge at the enemy that is nearest to Brooks, and then rush to her for an equally quick solution. Having Defense Matrix as a bonus power can pay huge dividends here as you can restore your shield instantly if it does go down while running the gauntlet. It's also possible to execute a grab kill on one of the CAT6 Specialists on the other side of the counter before he's aware of you, and the temporary invulnerability this affords you can also give you enough breathing room to recharge your shields and reach Brooks.
Find an Exit[]
Watch your step
A short cutscene plays out where another mercenary targets Shepard with a Mattock, but Brooks notices, shoves the Commander out of the way, and takes the bullet herself. Shepard tries to get to her, but the mercenary's bullets end up shattering the restaurant's glass floor. Shepard is sent on a wild ride down into the lower Ward. After several repeated attempts to stop, the Commander finally manages to fall onto a platform and stops.
Clearly injured, Shepard recovers the M-11 Suppressor and manages to get up. Brooks contacts the Commander, saying she has found a secure terminal. Shepard asks how Brooks is okay, and Brooks says she used all the medi-gel and now everything is a little bit bouncy. Shepard makes the comment that she probably used too much. Brooks asks if she can be of assistance, and Shepard tells her to alert C-Sec while the Commander looks for a way out.
A skycar dealership soon to go up in flames
Warning:  Shepard has only one health bar segment thanks to that drop through the floor, and remains that way throughout most of the rest of the mission. If you die, you will restart with an extra segment.
Proceed out the door and jump across to the next platform, down the ladder to your left, and then across to the next platform. There you will find a datapad about new temperature units.
Head down the next ladder, and Shepard will notice a landing pad. Brooks checks the area and notices it is a pad for Cision Motors. Shepard orders Brooks to get a shuttle there, but Brooks says that C-Sec had the entire area locked down and it will be difficult. Shepard orders her to keep trying. Brooks tells the Commander to stay off the comm as it is probably hacked, which she notes is probably how they found Shepard in the first place. Shepard asks who they are; Brooks replies that she doesn't know, but they clearly don’t like Shepard. Head down the next ladder and into the fish storage area on your right.
He's on his break, and there's nothing of value whatsoever in the area
The room doesn't contain much except frozen fish, crates of ""authentic European sushi"", and a salarian fish worker on a smoking break. Ignore him and head up the ladder if you're in a hurry, otherwise if you keep returning to his location, he'll be slightly creeped out by your actions.
Get to Skycar Lot[]
Above the ladder, you get a new NavPoint. Turn left, then across the gaps. Once you reach the end, there is a group of three enemies down on the lower level. Head down the ladder and hide behind the market stall counter before they spot you (fortunately, this stall appears to sell ammo and a grenade resupply).
Shooting is not advised. At this point, your best idea is to use stealth, as you will quickly find yourself in a whole world of enemies if you don't. Use tactics to pick them off one by one until you get discovered, then shoot the rest as quickly as possible. Keeping them off balance with grenades or stun effects from other powers will minimize the number of drones and grenades you will face. Make sure to take them all out before you move up—fortunately, they will not receive reinforcements until you advance down the market.
Tip: A nice way to deal with the opening portion of this encounter is to stay on the roof and use the Suppressor pistol to gun down just one of the CAT6 Specialists and then retreat back well out of sight. You'll eventually hear the other mercs in the area get alerted to the fact that something is wrong, and several may wonder aloud if someone might be back on the rooftops. If you wait, 1-3 of them will then climb up the ladder one by one to check things out. While it might not be entirely fair to ambush someone on a ladder, it's probably not going to come back to bite you anytime soon...
The two lanes leading forward are alternately patrolled
Class Specific: An Infiltrator at this point can cloak and dash the full length of the market to the point where it turns a sharp left and nears the bridge described below. Sentinels and Engineers should make full use of chain Overload to destroy Disruption Drones while simultaneously popping stunned mercenaries out of cover. The Vanguard can cover great distances with Charge and the stunning effects of the power especially if evolved for area damage can create enough space to get around the above mentioned corner to safety. Nova on the other hand is extremely risky to use due to your low health, even though it suffers no recharge penalty and can be effective against shielded targets.
As you progress, someone from the crew (either Liara or Shepard's love interest) will contact the Commander and ask if Shepard is okay, explaining that they are on foot but not far and that Joker filled them in. If you were expecting your love interest and it is Liara who contacts you, it may be that your romance is not yet locked in in the main game, or the love interest is not a squad member.
Brooks then cuts in and asks who they are as it is an unsecured channel and they are putting Shepard at risk. The crew member (henceforth referred to as ""Crewmate 1"") is confused until Shepard says that it is Brooks and orders everyone to play nice. Once you are clear, continue forward and you will find another datapad from EZ Meat, and some thermal clips. Grab as many as you can. There is no autosave at this point, so it is recommended that you use the quick save or a hard save.
The sniper camps out in the back beside the weapon mod
As you head past the large U-Forge-it stall beyond the meat kiosk, get ready to take cover, because you will encounter more enemies and this time they brought a nasty sniper. There are multiple decent cover locations on either side of U-Forge-it. Just be ready to move quickly if they throw their Multi-frag Grenades: one evasive plan is to retreat back around to the other side passage. Use the available cover, dodge the drones, and take out all of the mercs.
Once you are done, another crew member (""Crewmate 2"") will contact you saying they just heard about your predicament, and that everyone is on the way. In the shop called Ryuusei at the very end of the market, you will find a Pistol Power Magnifier and a terminal with 2,250 credits. Here you will also find a second grenade resupply.
Note:  Crewmate 2 will be the squad member who has accompanied Shepard on the most missions up to that point (unless that person is Crewmate 1, in which case Crewmate 2 will be the second most-picked squad member).
Head back out and around to the left. At the end is another stack of credits (1,500) and another datapad from a stall with less-than-acceptable sanitation standards. At the end is a bridge, locked down of course, but you can bypass it. Before doing so, the stall to your left labeled ""Value Added"" (and just adjacent to Fishdog Food Shack) has a terminal with more credits (2,250). Also be sure to refill your ammo fully at this point, returning to the market if needed, as you won't be able to return here once you open the door.
Once you start the bypass, the door asks for a C-Sec code, but Shepard's Spectre authorization overrides it. However, this also sets off an alarm which alerts everyone to you. Move fast, stay in cover. Crewmate 1 and 2 will both contact Shepard, claiming to hear the alarm. Make sure to clean out the area before stepping beyond the door, as it seals behind you when you do.
Get to Car Lot[]
Looks like someone's copying Cerberus tactics
Upon reaching the next area, you receive a slightly shorter NavPoint description. The area layout has bottomless voids for throwing enemies in, but it might be tricky to pull off attacks to exploit this, as there are few clear lines of sight for doing so and you will be doing so under heavy fire. Nevertheless, try when opportunity arises.
Get in cover because you are heavily outnumbered and outgunned. There are both troopers and snipers, appearing in waves as you try and make it to Cision Motors' back door. Initially, they come from an overhead platform as soon as your Spectre clearance overrides the lockdown.
Note:  Infiltrators and Vanguards can simply use their respective abilities to safely traverse the area, although in the Vanguard's case, clear line of sight to an enemy is required for a biotic Charge.
Tackling this conventionally, it might be best to stay near the door that you enter from and pick them off as they try and come around. Keep them in front of you, prevent flanks, and you should be fine. Just remember that headshots are always nice.
Don't forget to check out the three open shops
Once you have cleared the way, advance. As you round the corner, another wave will appear with another sniper. Further forward, be warned there are more enemies coming, this time troopers only, so just keep an eye on the drones and your ammo.
Along the right side is a series of explorable stores: Cepheid Variable, Van Allen Belts, and Kon Junction. They have useful loot in them: 1 datapad and 1 terminal worth 1,500 credits each store. Cepheid Variable has an Assault Rifle Ultralight Materials mod, and the final grenade resupply of the mission is in Van Allen Belts. It is advisable to check them out only after killing all mercs in your way, but if you're comfortable with multitasking, then by all means do so.
Once all enemies are finally down, Brooks will inform you about a C-Sec shuttle on the way to the skycar lot, and that you need to get there. On the service area of Cision Motors, another terminal (2,250 credits) and some much-needed ammo await. Head inside the door, and you will find Crewmate 1 holding off two mercenaries, which are quickly dispatched.
Locate Gate Controls[]
The weapon mod is near where the two mercs went down
Once you have completed a conversation with Crewmate 1, they will join you as a squadmate and you can now search the car lot to find the control panel to unlock the landing pad door. The cars all have information on them, which you can ignore or investigate. There is a Sniper Rifle Ultralight Materials near the door which you entered from, so don’t miss it. There is a terminal with credits (2,250) near a door at the back of the showroom (it's the door to your next destination).
As you approach the door to open it, it suddenly locks. You prepare to shoot the lock, but your companion puts their hand on the gun and pushes it down; they calmly knock on the window and politely ask a volus manager you didn't notice to open the door, which he does. The squadmate thanks him, and the frightened volus asks you to leave.
Get to Extraction Zone[]
Hey, hey, we're the mercenaries
Head out the doors and the C-Sec shuttle arrives, but it is yet another ambush by the mercenaries, who open fire with normal weapons as well as a Geth Spitfire. Shepard and the squadmate duck behind cover.
Fortunately, help arrives. Urdnot Wrex smashes through a window, slams into the shuttle, and crashes it onto the platform; Wrex then heads inside the shuttle and cleans out the ambushers. Alternatively, if Wrex is dead or you sabotaged the genophage cure, James Vega shows up with a Cobra Missile Launcher and shoots the shuttle down. When Shepard asks what Wrex is doing there, he claims to have been butting heads with the Council over krogan expansion. Wrex tosses Shepard the Spitfire (if James is present, Shepard will pick it up) just as another group of mercs pour in.
Pendejos will burn if Wrex ain't around
You start in cover and now have a full squad, and even better you'll find you've gained a segment or two of extra health. Don’t forget to assign points to Wrex's powers if he's in the party. In true krogan fashion, he's quite resilient and prefers getting up close and personal with his enemies if he's allowed, and a fully leveled-up Wrex easily tips the balance of power in your favor. He'll only have basic weapons for now, so letting him seek melee combat lets him do a bit more damage, though keep in mind that if he goes down in an exposed location the only safe way to revive him will be with First Aid; luckily, you begin this fight with 2 medi-gel and a full health bar.
You are not a krogan, and neither is your other companion, so remaining in cover near where you start is generally the wisest course. Here, you will have room to maneuver away from enemy drones and grenades. The enemies will pour in non-stop from the ceiling in two locations, so if you're feeling bold you can actually move inside the showroom and set up position in between the two spawn points and slaughter them as they come.
Actually, they'll suffer worse fates if Wrex IS around
The Spitfire has 1,000 rounds available, so feel free to be liberal with your firepower. The weapon needs time to spin up to full power, so it's not a bad idea to just hold the trigger down. While the fight rages, Joker and Brooks can be heard bickering over the comm: Joker has obtained a shuttle, picked up Brooks, and is on his way to you. Once you hear Joker tell you to get to the shuttle, fall back to the extraction zone behind the engines of the destroyed shuttle. The mission ends soon after you enter the highlighted extraction zone. Once the squad is on board, Joker pulls away."

Quest,Acquisition,Walkthrough
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Noveria:_Quarantine,"Prerequisite: Noveria: Matriarch Benezia
This mission is acquired during your pursuit of Matriarch Benezia within Peak 15. Speak with Dr. Cohen at Rift Station's Medical Bay regarding the sick scientists. He's reluctant to say anything because he has a non-disclosure agreement, so you must persuade him. If you tell him it's his call, you won't get the mission, though you can try to persuade him again afterward.
Warning:  If at any time you decide to turn the guards hostile, Dr. Cohen will either disappear or refuse to talk to you, rendering the mission impossible to acquire. If the mission is already underway, it becomes unable to be completed and will remain open in the journal even after completion of the main Noveria mission.","Ventralis has sealed off a lab where they were researching a bio-weapon; however, Ventralis mistakenly believes that it is still viable. Cohen assures Shepard that it is neutralized because of a brief exposure period, and he needs the cure they were researching to heal the other members of his team. If you charmed or intimidated Cohen for specifics, you'll learn about the toxin Thoros-B and its origins.
A couple of scientists sleeping through a crisis
If you require it, the Mira terminal in the medical bay can completely heal you and your squad. If you haven't obtained the primary Codex entry for medi-gel yet, the medical station right next to the terminal can be bypassed for some Phoenix Armors, XP, and medi-gel if you're below maximum (easy decryption). Note:  unlike most bypass jobs, if you cancel or fail the minigame, you won't get anything other than the Codex entry.
Go back and see Ventralis and after some persuasion he will give you access to the lab; head toward Quarantine and Barracks to get access to it. When you exit on the lower level you see Han Olar, talk to the volus to get information about the rachni and what happened at the station. Once you have all the information you want, before heading into the lab loot the storage locker (easy decryption) and if necessary access the Medical Station. Then talk to the guard and head inside the lab.
Bad idea to take cover behind the brown boxes: they're very destructible
Note:  Once you're in the lab, the guard won't let you out until you have completed the cure.
At the other end of the room is what you need to make the cure. Before you make the cure however head into the second door on the right and grab the med kit. The third room has a secure storage locker (average decryption), and there is a locked crate (easy decryption) next to the table. Finally, if you haven't acquired the codex entry for Thresher Maws yet it's just by the equipment near the terminal, labeled Xenobiological Database.
Access the research notes to figure out how to make the cure and then use the next station to make the cure. For that just push the Change Vial button each time the progress bar reaches proper concentration (is between two sliders). When you make the cure however you have some company.
Flatten them first before they do the same to you
Alestia Iallis enters with 2 Geth Troopers and an Asari Commando. You will share words (very brief ones, depending on your dialogue choice), but there is no talking your way out of one of the more dangerous fights in the entire game. When the conversation ends, you and your squad should take immediate and decisive action to disable as many of the attackers as possible. If you have Lift or ideally Singularity use them ASAP. Damping or Sabotage are also good opening moves, as is immediate activation of Immunity to keep you safe in case you are ragdolled by the biotics that will come flying at you. Focus on Alestia because she tends to be the greatest threat. Once she is down, focus on the Commando if present, then the geth.
Once they are all down head out of the lab and Han Olar will tell you that they came from the maintenance areas. With that information then head back up the elevator and head to Dr. Cohen to hand over the cure. The conversation can go a couple of ways, so you need to specifically talk to Cohen about the maintenance areas to get his pass. With some persuasion you can also weasel some medi-gel (4 Charm or 8 Intimidate) out of him.
The mission concludes after the dialogue with Cohen, yielding XP and 24 Paragon points. If you want to, talk to Ventralis again to tell him about Alestia. Before leaving visit Petozi for any last trading because it will be your last chance."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Virmire_(mission),"This mission is acquired after the completion of two of the first three plot worlds: Therum, Noveria, or Feros.
The next time you try to access the Galaxy Map in the Normandy, Joker informs you of a priority call from the Citadel. If you ask if it's from Udina, nope, it's from the Council. You cannot travel to other star systems while this is pending, so might as well take the call in the comm room.
The Councilors inform you that a salarian recon team sent nothing but static on a mission-priority channel. They reason they wouldn't have sent anything if it wasn't important, so they want to apprise you of all your options. The signal originated on Virmire, so you must go there to investigate.
The asari and salarian Councilors do most of the talking. If you want to antagonize them, the turian Councilor will speak up to offer his counterarguments. Morality points can be had in this exchange.","If you visit the Citadel and ask Anderson about this, he'll say that he has never even heard of Virmire before the Council passed the information to Shepard.
Virmire is in the Hoc system of the Sentry Omega cluster.
Drop Off[]
Under the radar
When the Normandy is approaching Virmire, Joker picks up the signal from the Salarian STG team, and Kaidan takes notice of the massive defense towers that surround Saren’s base. Joker will tell Shepard that he will get the Mako in under Saren’s radar. The Normandy swoops in and drops the Mako at low altitude. Once the Mako rolls to a stop, Joker comes over the radio and calls for a successful drop. Respond, but basically Shepard says the same thing. Shepard orders Joker to keep the Normandy out of range until the AA guns are down. You will notice some animals around, however they are harmless and don’t attack so ignore them.
Climb into the Mako and head off. There are no item pickups in the driving sections of the map, making it convenient if you don't plan on disembarking from the Mako unless absolutely required. Be careful near the ocean's edge, because the Mako can drive over the rocks leading to a Critical Mission Failure.
Around the second corner you will encounter some Geth Rocket Drones and Geth Assault Drones. These are actually harder to take out from the Mako than on foot, so exit and start shooting. Keep moving forward, taking out another group of drones along the way.
Insanity Tips: Rockets and especially snipers can one-shot Shepard on this level, so be careful getting out of the Mako when there is a large group around. Remember to turn the Mako sideways to any large enemies and ""rock back and forth"" to avoid rockets; likewise when you're outside the Mako and in the great outdoors where there isn't much cover, keep on the move while you shoot to avoid incoming missiles. But if you've made it this far on Insanity level you won't find anything in the vehicular section of Virmire too difficult.
The Mako rewriting the definition of ""roadkill"" with a geth Juggernaut
Ahead on the right are some Geth Rocket Troopers that just love to shoot rockets, so make sure they get only a shot or two off before they are scrap metal. Around the next corner are a bunch of Pod Crabs, two Geth Rocket Drones, and a Geth Juggernaut. Take out the hostiles any way you wish then move up to where they were to get a better shot at the accompanying Rocket Troopers.
About halfway down the next stretch you will come under rocket fire and your Mako radar will become jammed. Disembarking from the vehicle lifts the jamming and allows you to save, but restricts enemy detection to only a few meters from your team. There are some Rocket Drones at the end, so deal with them and then round the corner. On a bank to the left are three sets of geth shields and of course some more geth: four Rocket Troopers, two Assault Drones, and another Rocket Drone. Some may be hiding behind the rocks so you have to move up to take them all out. When they are down, head around the next corner and you can see a structure in the distance.
Gatehouse One[]
They hit you hard, you hit back harder
When you get close to the first gatehouse you start to come under fire from the geth guarding it. The group outside consists of two Geth Rocket Drones, one Rocket Trooper, and two Troopers. You can drive up and take them out on foot, or shoot them from a distance. Depending on your movements some of the defenders upstairs may come out of their initial positions to engage you, so be mindful. This also applies to the defenders of the other gatehouses down the road.
When all the initial geth are down, move up, if you haven’t already, and head up the stairs to the left. There are two more Troopers on the top, who may or may not have engaged the fight along with the troops below. In the far room accessible through a bare short tunnel is a Hardened Weapon Locker (hard decryption) plus two Geth Stalkers, a Geth Ghost, and a Geth Sniper (Legendary Edition:  The short tunnel has been furnished with two crates for cover, and as the next two gatehouses have similar architectures this also applies to them as well). There is also another Weapon Locker (easy decryption) on a wall before the tunnel to the gatehouse control room, be sure to open it before you leave. When you are done head back to the Mako and drive along.
Gatehouse Two[]
Consulting your map, the path from the first to the second gatehouse splits into two then merges again. Whichever path you take is immaterial as they both have enemies there: if you're not in a hurry, blast 'em all, or if you're speedrunning, pick one path and speed through.
The mako adding geth colossi to its list of roadkills
Just outside the first gatehouse and before the split there is a Geth Colossus on your way. On both forks of the path there are an initial two Geth Armatures each. The path that appears closed off on your map is actually just a narrow archway, and it has another Geth Colossus beyond it. The alternate path has another Geth Armature and another Geth Colossus in separate places.
Aside from the standard gun them down then exit the Mako for the killing blow for maximizing exp if you aren't playing Legandary Edition, you can take advantage of the level geometry and ram them off the ocean barricades for instant death if the opportunity appears, just be vigilant you don't overshoot the Mako and drown yourself. The colossi are particularly situated for this tactic though the armatures can also be victimized if you're diligent enough. The walkers are very susceptible to ramming and they waste a lot of time trying to reorient after such an attack, so do it often and preemptively especially if they're about to fire their Siege Pulse weapons.
As you get closer to the second gatehouse you may be hit with a powerful radar jamming that will obscure the enemy walker count if you aren't done dealing with them yet. Disembark from the Mako, equip your (or your squadmates') preferred weapon with your most powerful detection upgrades, then board the vehicle again. The jamming source is inside the gatehouse so dealing with it will have to wait until you arrive there.
Two geth Destroyers and a Sniper guarding Gatehouse Two's controls
The second gatehouse is similar to the first except the stairs are on the right and you cannot proceed further until you disable the artillery holding the Normandy back in the control room. Hostile headcount in the gate level is just a Rocket Trooper, a Geth Shock Trooper, and a Geth Sniper. Upstairs is another Rocket Trooper and Shock Trooper. Defending the control room is a Geth Sniper and two Geth Destroyers.
The control room has the toggles for the AA guns as well as the gatehouse doors. Switch off the guns first, then open up the doors, and get looting if you haven't yet. In the room is a Secure Weapon Locker (average decryption), and on the far side wall along the stairway is a crate.
When the AA tower is down, Joker radios that he is on approach to the salarian camp, you’re done here so get back into the Mako and drive on.
Gatehouse Three[]
As you drive under the gatehouse, the Normandy flies overhead en route to the salarian camp.
Color them shocked when three organics and a tank demolish the prior gauntlet of geth
When you round the corner you encounter the last gatehouse and the final line of defense before the camp. As with the second gatehouse you must raise the gates at the control room before you can pass. Enemy composition here is a Rocket Trooper and two Troopers at ground level, three Shock Troopers inside the gatehouse building, and two Destroyers in the control room. Lootables include a Hardened Weapons Locker (hard decryption) in the control room and a crate along the wall by the entrance tunnel.
When you reenter the Mako, just gun it because there are no more enemies between you and the salarian camp. When you get closer Joker radios that the Normandy is down safely but they are apparently grounded, the salarian captain can explain when Shepard arrives.
Salarian Camp[]
Saren's forces apparently don't notice hostiles squatting right next to their walls
When you reach the camp you are rewarded with credits and experience. A cutscene plays where Ashley and Kaidan are arguing with the salarian captain. The captain needs more time to come up with a plan, and when Shepard arrives, he introduces himself as Captain Kirrahe, 3rd Infiltration Regiment, STG. Kirrahe asks if Shepard was all the Council sent and is dismayed when he learns that his transmission was unclear. He lost half of his men investigating this place and Shepard’s orders were just the same.
When asked he talks about the base, apparently heavily fortified and guarded by a legion of geth. Kirrahe mentions that Saren is breeding an army of krogan. If you recruited Wrex to your team, he walks over and asks how that's possible. Kirrahe says that Saren found a cure for the genophage and it needs to be destroyed. Wrex disagrees, but Kirrahe insists as he thinks the krogan were a mistake. Wrex gets in Kirrahe's face, stating ""[w]e are not a mistake!"" Kirrahe requests that you resolve the issue with Wrex while he comes up with an assault plan.
Main article: Virmire: Wrex and the Genophage
This mission is then renamed Virmire: Saren's Plan in the journal. When you regain movement control, you can explore the camp at your own pace. Every NPC in the area (except the salarian pacing by the beach) has dialogue lines you can explore, and may change depending on how you dealt with Wrex. Squadmates also temporarily become NPCs: they stand around the camp in their original armor regardless of whatever you got for them, though this is merely a cosmetic change and they'll wear your preferences next mission.
Somebody's not going home today, and the decision is entirely yours
The tent nearest to the base wall has a codex entry from the Communications Relay (easy decryption). Liara loiters here if you already rescued her from Therum. Wrex is on the beach in front of her, intermittently blasting at the shore and the air with his shotgun until you talk to him.
The central tent has Kirrahe, who is your key to story progression. If you dealt with Wrex already, or if the krogan was never in your party to begin with, speak to him to get things going. Ashley and Kaidan  hang around in here initially.
The tent at the other side of the camp has Commander Rentola, Kirrahe's second-in command and supply officer. Beside him is a Medical Station (easy decryption). He has a limited selection of goods to sell but it is a good place to unload unnecessary gear before heading out. Sell any excess items you've accumulated to Rentola, because there's a long segment coming up and you don't want to end up at your inventory limit. Tali and Garrus can also be found in Rentola's vicinity: Tali inside the tent, and Garrus on the beach outside if you recruited him.
Note:  You cannot rely on the decryption skills of your squadmates here on the salarian camp - if you play as a Soldier or have low decryption skills on your own the med station and the comms relay will remain inaccessible.
""Bit of a cloaca, though. Loved his speeches. Hold the line!""
When you are ready, head back to Kirrahe and he says that he has come up with a plan, sort of, and involves high risk and a lot of luck. He will divide his men into three teams and hit the front of the facility while Shepard and team “Shadow” sneaks around back. When asked about the team names Kirrahe will list of the other three: Aegohr, Mannovai, and Jaëto, the salarians' first three colony worlds. He hopes that they will remind the men what they are fighting for.
He also needs to ask Shepard for a huge favor, he needs one of Shepard’s squad for the assault. Both Ashley and Kaidan volunteer. Send whomever you wish with Kirrahe, however be warned that whichever one you send will be unavailable as a squadmate for the rest of Virmire. Personal preference or squad balance, keep whichever in mind when choosing.
When you are done Kirrahe gives you one last opportunity to hold off before the attack, if you do then just talk to him again to proceed. When you get ready to proceed, Kirrahe gives a speech to the men then wishes Shepard luck and asks the Commander to be on the lookout for anything that can assist the teams. When the squad selection screen comes up, there's your cue to navigate on to the next part of the mission."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Noveria:_Rift_Station,"Prerequisite: Noveria: Matriarch Benezia
This mission can be acquired in 3 ways:
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes: bypass the door despite warnings and see what it gets youBy approaching the sealed-off doors at the restricted area of the Rift Station main level. A computer voice will alert you that the ""Watchdog Protocol"" is active.
Being accosted by Han Olar after Alestia Iallis' attack during Noveria: Quarantine will update your journal if you haven't done the former yet.
If you did Noveria: The Hot Labs first, your journal updates with the mission entry whichever way you choose to reach the Secure Lab as detailed below. The upper entry is gained if you went through the Restricted Area, while the alternative entry is gained if you went through the Ventilation Room via Scientist Barracks.","In order to progress the story you'll eventually need to get into the Secure Lab. Consult the maps for both main and lower levels of Rift Station for directions and location labels.
Breaking In[]
One way is through the restricted area at the Rift Station Main Area.
This route provides extra fighting, though not particularly difficult, and accompanying extra experience and credits. Warning:  If you do this, all Rift Station characters will react with alarm to your actions and will not transact with you again. No more shopping from Petozi, and you can never acquire nor complete Noveria: Quarantine upon turning everyone hostile.
Take advantage of the level design to efficiently get rid of these rent-a-cops
Begin by hacking the door to the ""Restricted Area"" -- it's near the med bay, and has two Assault Drones guarding it. The drones will attack immediately - gun them down. Then, before entering the door, you have the option of returning to the room you just left and fighting the guards there. Also optionally, you can head all the way back to Captain Ventralis and dispose of him and his two henchmen.
Enter the door you hacked and fight your way through another series of guards along a corridor. In this S-shaped corridor on your map you may face up to 9 ERCS Guards, all toting shotguns and assault rifles, so expect engagements at close to medium ranges. There are numerous explosive containment cells you can destroy to damage (or kill) some of the guards. The area has both indestructible and destructible cover in equal measure, so you can prevent hostiles from cowering behind the brown boxes if the need arises.
The corridor leads to an elevator. Beyond the elevator is a technician kit and an upgrade kit on the floor. On your map there are two routes: to the Secure Lab, which is where Benezia is, and to the Ventilation Room, which is where you would have gone if you chose the sneaky route.
Sneaking In[]
Main article: Noveria: Quarantine
Another way is through a maintenance back door at the Quarantine Lab. Approach Dr. Zev Cohen at the Med Bay, and after doing the Noveria: Quarantine mission for him ask for his back door pass. This is the most peaceful option available and results in relatively minor casualties.
Note that upon successfully sneaking in, you can still choose the alternative of fighting your way in for extra credits and experience.
Wrong place, wrong time
Head back down past Han Olar and into the maintenance area, which looks like a cave. You will enter unopposed and without being detected, and will not provoke fights with guards. On the way there is a solitary Rachni Soldier, so kill it and enter the back door. The alternative journal entry above overwrites the first one once you reach the door.
When you walk through there is a secure storage locker (average decryption) on the catwalks. The room after this goes only two ways: to the Secure Lab, or backtrack to the mess hall via the Restricted Area elevator. If you wish to pick a fight with the guards above, ignore the Watchdog Protocol warning and take the elevator up. Otherwise, just loot the upgrade and technician kits before the elevator. Once you are done head back to the Secure Lab door and save your game before entering.
Ventralis and the Hot Labs[]
Surprise, we're not actually friendly
Now, if you decided to pursue the lead at the Hot Labs before dealing with the business inside the Secure Lab, upon your return to the mess hall Ventralis surprises you with treachery, revealing himself and the entire security force to be under Benezia's employ.
They're all shielded and fairly clumped together at the mess hall, so crowd control talents will put them down quickly. You are also fairly exposed despite the presence of cover, so retreating back beyond the door you came in to whittle them down is a viable solution. Of the four ERCS Guards with Ventralis, two wield the standard shotgun/assault rifle weapons, one has a sniper rifle/pistol combo, and one has a pistol only. Be particularly wary of surprise assassinations.
In this scenario, everyone in the facility is either out to kill you (the guards and drones) or absent (the other characters except Han Olar down at the Scientist Barracks). If you mixed the cure for Thoros-B on Noveria: Quarantine, you can't return it to Dr. Cohen anymore. You obtain additional combat rewards in this manner but at the expense of NPC presence. You may learn from Olar later that Ventralis had the most of the civilians killed to cover up Binary Helix's mistake with the rachni.
Doubly-traumatized volus can't be asked to care anymore
As before, you can reach the Secure Lab by going through the Restricted Area and the baddies there, and/or the maintenance tunnel next to the Scientist Barracks. The doors to both are already unlocked compared to the previous scenarios, with the same number of enemies and lootables on either route give or take a few things. If you decide on the maintenance tunnel path first, on reaching the Scientist Barracks you'll see Han Olar being threatened at gunpoint by an Asari Commando. After a short cutscene, you'll need to deal with the commando and the 2 ERCS guards there. If you decide on the Restricted Area first then backtrack via maintenance tunnel, you'll only see 2 ERCS guards at the Scientist Barracks, with no trace of Han Olar or the commando.
Fate of a Species[]
The Queen speaks through the asari
The mission ceases to be of relevance once you reach Benezia in the Secure Lab; see Noveria: Matriarch Benezia for handling the showdown with her. However, it is brought to the fore again shortly afterward.
When Benezia finally dies, move a bit closer to the Rachni Queen's tank. You will enter a conversation with the Rachni Queen through one of the dead commandos. The dialogue factors in whether you've dealt with Noveria: The Hot Labs yet or not. You can ask questions about her history and her plans if Shepard releases her. Now you have the ultimate choice: activate the acid tanks and kill off the rachni once and for all, or allow the Queen to leave and begin anew.
You get a cutscene showing your actions. The mission is marked complete when you reach a decision regarding the Queen."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Noveria:_Peak_15,"Prerequisite: Noveria: Leave Port Hanshan
The mission can be acquired in at least four ways. The earliest is by talking to the businesswoman hanging out with a salarian at Port Hanshan Plaza, near the elevator to the docking bay (most of the corporate NPCs at Port Hanshan skeptically mention rumors of accidents at Peak 15 if talked to). Another is by talking to Lilihierax about rumors in Peak 15. Another is by receiving a warning from Gianna Parasini once she reveals her true allegiances.
If you rushed your way through Port Hanshan and minimized character interactions, the latest you can acquire this mission is upon switching on the Peak 15 VI's backup power core at the facility itself.","Mira, Peak 15's VI
You only need to turn the VI on in order to accomplish this mission. Arriving at the VI core location is a natural progression of the overarching mission, see Noveria: Matriarch Benezia for details.
After activating the power core, move to the far end of the room. Take the elevator down to repair the VI. You have two options: use 100 omni-gel or repair it manually by solving a Tower of Hanoi puzzle. If you want to do this the ""hard"" way, read on.
Rules[]
These are a few rules about the puzzle.
Only a single box may be transferred to any stack, regardless of whether or not they are adjacent.
Only the topmost box will be ""picked up"" when one presses the corresponding face button. It will be 'placed' in the same order when another face button is pressed. This means that if the top-most box is selected, it will drop into the top most area of any stack it is dropped in. The same applies to the other boxes as well.
A box may not be transferred to a space where there will be a blue box in any slot above it.
After transferring a box to another stack, it may be transferred back as many times as required.
Only one box may be ""picked up"" at a time.
Direct Solutions[]
Shepard acquires a pathological aversion to Towers of Hanoi here
The VI can be manually reinitialized with the following key sequence:
Xbox 360: X Y, X B, Y B, X Y, B X, B Y, X Y, X B, Y B, Y X, B X, Y B, X Y, X B, Y B
PC: Column 1 → 2, 1 → 3, 2 → 3, 1 → 2, 3 → 1, 3 → 2, 1 → 2, 1 → 3, 2 → 3, 2 → 1, 3 → 1, 2 → 3, 1 → 2, 1 → 3, 2 → 3
PS3: ▢ △, ▢ ◯, △ ◯, ▢ △, ◯ ▢, ◯ △, ▢ △, ▢ ◯, △ ◯, △ ▢, ◯ ▢, △ ◯, ▢ △, ▢ ◯, △ ◯
Once the core is repaired, Shepard is raised back up and the VI comes online. She will ask for your credentials and you can respond any way you wish, as either way you get Secure Access. You can ask some questions, but other questions she won't answer because apparently Privileged Access is only available to Binary Helix executives. Eventually she will tell you that the there are two things needed to get the station operation again.
Noveria: Reconnect Landlines - Reconnecting the landlines on the roof to restore Mira's full functionality
Noveria: Reactor Repair - Getting the reactor core back online by fixing the helium-3 fuel lines
Pick whichever task you'll perform first, and head to the appropriate elevator. The landlines are in the elevator behind Shepard, and the reactor is down and off to the left in the main room."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Noveria:_Reconnect_Landlines,"Prerequisite: Noveria: Peak 15
The mission is acquired upon reactivation of the Mira VI. It is one of two tasks you need to do before progressing further.","Take the elevator behind the Mira core. Exit the elevator when it stops and save your game because you'll soon face an intense fight. When you emerge on the roof itself there are rachni all over the place: about 5 Rachni Soldiers and 10+ Rachni Workers. Use anything you can to take them out quickly.
Try not to get drenched in acid
Do not charge out of the hallway. Instead, position your squad and move forward solo slowly. There are some rachni in the forward position so you can try to isolate and take them out. Wide-field biotic abilities can keep the rachni distracted while you hammer at them.
Pulling back into the hallway can minimize the number of soldiers who have firing angles on you, allowing you to deal with workers moving forward or hurl grenades out to dispose of them. The rachni will not follow you back into the tunnel, nor do they regenerate their health, so you can also use the automatic door as a kind of blast shield when you need to take refuge and heal.
Once the enemies are down reconnect the landlines and then access the nearby Mira Terminal for an update on the Rift Station and Hot Labs. She can also give you more information on what happened before you arrived. When you have everything you want, pick open the locked crate (easy Decryption) and head back down to the core."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Race_Against_Time:_Final_Battle,"Prerequisite: Race Against Time: Conduit
This mission is acquired after the trip through the Conduit on Ilos. Its journal entry is the final rename for the Race Against Time mission series.","Presidium[]
Upon using the Conduit the scene shifts to the Presidium where Avina is going on about the damage to the Citadel. As the camera rotates to show two geth the Conduit’s end point begins powering up and the core activates. The geth move to investigate, but the Mako exits the mini Mass Relay and crushes the geth before rolling over against the far wall. Shepard and the squad crawl out of the wreckage and after looking around you regain control.
Bro you can sweet-talk imaginary chicks later, we've got a galactic invasion to do
Take the med kit next to the overturned Mako. When you walk over to the elevator, three Dragon's teeth come down and release their husks. Just make sure they don’t get too close. You must kill the husks before the elevator becomes accessible.
When you are done with the husks, you can talk to Avina, or skip the interactions and head straight for the elevator.
Avina tells you only a few things, like the fact you need to evacuate the Presidium and how much damage to the Presidium there is. However, she does provide some useful information: Saren is approaching the Council Chambers, and C-Sec is currently unable to respond to the threat. She also tells you that there are a lot of geth on the station and the Citadel Tower. She also tells you that the Citadel Council (along with nearly 10,000 citadel inhabitants) was evacuated to the Destiny Ascension per emergency procedures. If you ask about Anderson and Udina, Avina says that she can’t give the locations on specific individuals.
A man's not truly evil unless he murders two keepers in irritation
After you activate the elevator, the scene shifts to the Council Chambers where Saren is walking across and blows two keepers away as he goes. He goes up to the Petitioner's Stage: a platform extends, a holographic panel appears, and Saren goes to work.
Citadel Tower Maintenance Shaft[]
The scene shifts to the exterior where the Citadel's arms begin to close and Executor Pallin orders what ships are left to not let Sovereign inside the arms. Several turian cruisers are in position and open fire on Sovereign. However, their shots do nothing and Sovereign forces its way in, destroying a cruiser in the process. Sovereign goes straight to the tower and wraps its limbs around the structure.
The scene shifts again to the elevator you're using to ride up to the tower. It shudders to a stop and after looking around for a second, Shepard orders the squad to suit up because they are going outside. After a second a shot shatters the glass on the side of the window and Shepard and the squad, fully sealed in their combat suits, step out and onto the exterior of the elevator.
Sovereign is looming on the horizon. It periodically brings down a massive leg, which results in some wobbling and can potentially throw off your aim.
Saren's disposable welcome party
Because the elevator is no longer an option you must use the exhaust plain of the Citadel Tower to get to the Council Chambers before Saren can turn the station over to Sovereign. Consulting your map, you're in the Citadel Tower's Maintenance Shaft, and it's a straight walk all the way towards the south. Head forward and keep going until you reach a downward ramp. When you walk down be careful because there will be problems shortly. Because the elevators are locked down, there is an elevator stuck in the tube to your left. Another elevator comes screaming up the tube and crashes into the stationary one.
The elevator contained some Geth Troopers. Further along the corridor is a Geth Rocket Trooper and a Geth Shock Trooper. There are plenty of protrusions and corners in the corridor, use them to take cover and scrap the geth. When they are down, head up the ramp and onto the next area.
Tips:
Most of the mission takes place in the Citadel Tower's exterior, which is in zero-g; you and your enemies are only walking on the surface via magnetic boots. A highly leveled Lift, Throw, or Singularity is often enough by itself to propel enemies (even heavy ones) off into space, killing them without the need for further fighting.
Anytime you can Throw an enemy against a sloped 45 degree wall, such as the elevator tube in this first encounter, it is almost certain to sail harmlessly off into the ""ceiling"", or into space in more open areas.
Consider equipping Sledgehammer Rounds or High Explosive Rounds even if you're using a pistol, since it will not only occasionally knock enemies down, it will also allow you to push floating enemies further and more quickly off the map, adding even more certainty to the Lift/Throw strategy. Plus Sledgehammer Rounds in a Shotgun or Sniper Rifle will knock plenty of enemies helplessly off their feet.
A Warlord and a Destroyer tag teams to take you out
After the ramp is another corridor. There's a single Trooper, then a Krogan Warlord. Use Lift on the krogan, and if it is powerful enough, the krogan will just float away. A Geth Destroyer also spawns to help the Warlord out. Beyond them is another uphill ramp studded with geth barriers as well as Troopers and Shock Troopers, beyond which is the exhaust plain of the tower.
Note:  If you stay back and do not approach the upward ramp yet, a series of as many as 5 Destroyers will appear one by one and attack you. This is the first of several upcoming opportunities to gain additional experience by standing back and killing a whole series of Destroyers. Obviously if you're looking to fight the minimum number of enemies, you should cross toward the krogan sooner rather than later as the spawning of additional Destroyers seems based on how far down the path you've moved.
Citadel Tower Exhaust Plain[]
Once you proceed up the ramp you are now in the exhaust plain, and the terrain is slightly tilted. Consulting your map, your path will take you southeast to a corridor, then another open area, then southwest.
They can easily kill you if you aren't attentive, though fortunately you have plenty of places to evade them
You will see a few Shock Troopers, Rocket Troopers, and a Geth Sniper. Outdoors is the place to make your biotic abilities shine, so go to town on the synthetics with physics attacks as needed. As usual, the Sniper poses the greatest threat of instant death, so deal with it immediately.
When they are dealt with, take a left from the top of the ramp, head to the wall, take another left, and continue on. When you reach the corridor, there are some more geth on it. Get into cover and deal with the Shock Troopers but stay in cover.
Nothing like the smell of burnt circuits in the morning
Geth Destroyers will come from the other side and charge. If you remain at your end of the corridor, 10 Destroyers will eventually spawn, one at a time. If you use Lift on them as they charge, they will sail straight over your head off the station and provide full experience (for extra style points try to get their corpses to bounce off Sovereign's arm above and behind you). If you'd rather not fight 10 Destroyers (or wait for them to spawn), you can charge toward the end of the corridor which prevents further spawning -- but be ready to deal with one more Destroyer if it spawns.
As you approach the end of the corridor an autosave is generated. When you round the corner a Citadel Defense Turret is right in front of you. Don’t worry because it is currently inactive and even if activated it won’t attack you. When you enter the next area, a Geth Dropship flies over and starts dropping troops. You have two options here: either activate the turrets, or if you're going for maximum experience points just shoot the Geth Shock Troopers.
Activate all three turrets, watch the Dropship go boom
If you activate the turrets then the dropship will take damage over time and eventually fly away. There are three turrets, one of them requires average Electronics. You only need to activate one turret, though the dropship will take longer to bring down. If you choose to ignore the dropship and shoot the geth it will gradually drop about 15 – 20 Shock Troopers and then just sit there forlorn. You can then activate the turrets to drive it away for an additional experience award. Tip: If you're looking to gain the most experience from this encounter, avoid activating the turrets as this increases the total amount of geth that spawn. If you're in a hurry or trying to play it safe, use the turrets.
When you have defeated all the geth and the dropship is gone, move up and around to where the dropship was dropping off the troopers and head down the path.
Citadel Tower Exterior Defense Grid[]
Before you proceed around the corner another autosave is generated. You are now exiting the exhaust plain and entering the defense grid through a corridor. Your next waypoint is finally revealed in the map, but first things first, deal with the corridor hostiles.
Let the bodies hit the floor
You will find two Krogan Warriors waiting for you in this last hall of unending charging Destroyers; this time up to six Destroyers will spawn, though they usually won't spawn until you've killed at least one of the krogan, and they will stop spawning entirely if you kill the second (Legendary Edition:  Up to a whopping 14 Destroyers spawn now). As usual, Lifting the krogan or destroyers, especially when charging, will invariably send them off into space and give you the experience.
Also as before you can press forward toward the end of the corridor to stop the spawning of Destroyers BUT when you approach the other end of the tube, whether all the Destroyers spawned or not, a Geth Juggernaut will come around the corner suddenly so be prepared to deal with it. Once you're done here, more problems await you around the corner.
Consulting your map, there are two ways to get to the plot waypoint to the south: through the wide area, or the narrow area. Each have their own set of enemies, though if you're feeling bloodthirsty or hungering for XP why not deal with both before proceeding.
You can either straight-up destroy the shielded turrets or you can go downstairs to either circumvent them entirely or to take them out on the other side
The wide area is open-air but deadly because you not only have to deal with a few geth but also four Geth Turrets. The turrets ignore your shields and can kill you in one shot depending on your difficulty level so stay in cover or on the move at all times. After taking down the initial geth and the first turret, you have the choice of pressing on through the rest of the turrets, or circumventing them by following the ramp down and to the left to the narrow area: another elevator trench/corridor. This area is full of krogan, but you don't have to dodge usually instant kill rockets, so make your choice.
When taking on the turrets in the open area put Shepard in one place and the squad in another. The turrets will target the two positions at random so you are not constantly under attack. When taking on the turrets, use Overload, Warp, Marksman, Carnage, Assassination, Overkill, or anything else to take them down one by one. Keep moving around and up as you need to, but keep the squad separated to divide fire between them and Shepard. Again, the wide open space is very conducive to physics attacks, so you better have not gone to Ilos without at least one relevant biotic talent on your team. If you or your squad have sniper training, it's also your time to shine.
Combat Tips:
When multiple turrets are attacking you, a safe (if slow) plan is to put Shepard behind one of the long horizontal wall. Peek out from the edge to snipe the nearest turret from afar, but then move Shepard back away from the corner of the wall once you take your shot to shelter from the ""splash damage"" of incoming rockets.
As long as you keep on the move it's pretty unlikely a rocket will hit you, so a closer range strategy is indeed possible if you're feeling like a cowboy. In this case use Sabotage where possible to silence turrets temporarily, and keep moving a LOT.
Master level Hacking works on turrets, so you can have them help take out geth (or each other) for you but be careful of when it wears off.
Where's a biotic singularity when you need one
If you want to deal with the trench, expect two Krogan Warriors, one BattleMaster, and two Warlords. The BattleMaster and Warlords always spawn opposite from the way you came in, meaning if you went through the southern entrance from the open area they'll spawn at the other end, up north.
The Battlemaster can use a biotic throw to knock you off your feet, which is quite dangerous with krogan around, so use Damping or try to keep knocking him down as much as possible. Unlike his brethren he prefers to hang back, although if you cross his distance threshold he will also charge at you like the others. This particular corridor also has a ceiling meaning you can't simply Lift them into space, though along with Throw and Neural Shock these are effective ways to keep them off their feet.
When you're ready to proceed, head down the far ramp and proceed to the southern end of the plain to enter the Council Chambers.
Citadel Council Chambers[]
When there's something strange in the neighborhood, who you gonna call
When you enter the Council Chambers, everything is on fire and alarms are going off, very different from the last time you were here, though with fewer arrogant people. Head up the stairs and grab the med kit as you go. When you reach the large courtyard, you can see Saren's last line of defense, seven Geth Troopers and two Geth Shock Troopers, not really much of a final defense. Use the rocks all around for cover and then shoot the final geth full of holes.
Note: When you are done, save your game, because this one of the last times you can make a manual save. It's also a good time to check your equipment and make sure you have all the right ammo and armor upgrades.
Walk up the Master Control Terminal and a cutscene will play showing Saren punching a few buttons then jumping off the platform. After a few seconds he reappears on his flying platform and throws a grenade at the squad, sending them leaping for cover.
Saren was apparently worried that Shepard wouldn't make it in time to see him help Sovereign take control of the Citadel and bring back the Reapers. After talking back and forth a few times, Saren reveals that Sovereign implanted him, and now he is fully committed to the cause of the Reapers.
Talk Saren down and he does this to himself
If you managed to convince Saren on Virmire then he says that it was because he couldn't stop thinking about what Shepard said, and because Sovereign sensed his hesitation, the Reaper implanted Saren. If you didn't then he just skips that part and tries to get Shepard on the Reapers' side because they need organics.
Saren goes on to warn Shepard that the Reapers can't be stopped and they will return eventually. If you have enough Paragon or Renegade points your response can get an interesting reaction out of Saren. Additionally, if you convinced Saren on Virmire about indoctrination, another set of persuasion options opens up where you can convince Saren to fight his implants, though they resist and Saren says it's too late.
If you managed to persuade him on Virmire then you have a final set of dialogue options. If you use either, Saren will pull his pistol and shoot himself in the head. If you don’t, then you have to fight him, or you can choose that option anyway.
Legendary Edition: If you choose the Paragon option then you will receive an experience reward. If you choose to fight Saren, killing him will not be rewarded with any XP; however, killing the waves of geth Saren summons during the fight does reward experience. Killing all of the geth waves rewards about 50% more XP than choosing the Paragon option.
Fighting Saren[]
Otherwise, conventional bossfight again, yay
Full tactics for fighting Saren can be found in his article, but the executive summary is fairly simple: fill him full of holes. Because of the hover platform again, he is immune to most biotic powers, though tech and combat powers still have an effect. Stay in the cover you start in because there really isn't any other good cover around.
Legendary Edition:  To spice things up, geth troops now periodically spawn around Saren: Troopers, Shock Troopers, and even Destroyers, anywhere in the Council Chambers. Staying in one place is not an option if you don't want surprise rifle butts to the head from Destroyers. The spawns don't stop until Saren's dead, so as with the original game prioritize hammering away at him despite the number of targets now gunning for your team.
Eventually when Saren takes enough damage he falls from the platform and crashes through the skylights of the park below.
The Big Decision[]
Note: This is the absolute last chance you have to make a manual save so take advantage of it.
The cavalry arrives
Walk up to the Control Terminal and Shepard pulls out an Omni-tool and uploads Vigil’s data file, which gives control of all the Citadel’s systems. One of your squadmates says to open the arms, quickly, while the other says to get a comm channel open.
As Shepard gets the comm channel open the first thing is a mayday call from the Destiny Ascension. Their shields are failing and their engines are offline. They also mention that the council is on board. Then Joker cuts in and hopes that he is contacting the Commander. Respond and Joker will say that he is sitting in the Andura sector with the entire Arcturus Fleet and that they can save the Ascension if Shepard opens the Relays to the Citadel.
Your squadmates have a few comments on that note. One says to let the Council die because of what they have, or rather haven’t done for humanity. The other will counter that the situation is much larger than humanity and that Sovereign is a threat to the entire galaxy. The first squad member counters with because of that, saving the Ascension will waste reinforcements. Make your choice and be prepared to live with the consequences.
The Ascension faces off against the geth
Paragon Option: If Shepard orders the Alliance to save the Ascension; the Alliance Fleet, led by the Normandy, screams through the relay and Admiral Hackett orders all Alliance ships to save the Flagship. Alliance vessels open fire on the geth ships attacking the Ascension, and while they take some casualties, they do manage to destroy the remaining geth ships. Joker radios that the Ascension is all clear and when the Citadel’s arms open, Hackett orders all remaining ships to focus their fire on Sovereign.
Renegade/Neutral Option: Choosing either ""Let the Council die"" or ""Concentrate on Sovereign"" causes the Alliance fleet to come through the relay but Hackett orders all Alliance ships to hold back. The Ascension opens a comm channel to the Alliance fleet, but the human forces close the channel. The Ascension is destroyed by the geth as the Alliance Fleet passes by. The Citadel’s arms open and Hackett orders all remaining ships to open fire on Sovereign. Choosing ""Let the Council die"" maximizes Renegade point gains, whereas picking ""Concentrate on Sovereign"" awards an equal mix of both Paragon and Renegade points.
The scene shifts back to the Council Chambers and Shepard orders the squad to make sure Saren is dead. They jump down and one walks up to the corpse and pumps another shot into it, while the other radios that Saren is dead. However, the station suddenly rocks and red lightning bolts are seen all around. Saren’s body becomes infused with the bolts and an explosion sends your squadmates against walls. The platform Shepard is standing on drops and dumps the Commander into the field below. Meanwhile the implants in Saren's body come to life and strip away the flesh that covered them. Eventually all that is left is a metal skeleton that jumps out of sight.
The Final Battle[]
When you regain control begin moving instantly because this is a fight of maneuverability and not from cover. There is no good cover around, and you can’t be behind any for very long so just keep moving. The bigger set of rocks to the upper left can provide temporary cover against most of Saren's attacks if you need to heal and recharge, but you won't be able to damage Saren very quickly from there.
Hyperactive zombie on the loose, approach with caution
This reincarnation of Saren is much like a Geth Hopper and jumps around frequently. As the endgame boss bring nothing less than master-level talents against him: Powers like Throw and Lift are a great help because they can keep him off balance allowing you to pepper him with bullets. The thing is to keep on the move because he keeps jumping and using abilities such as carnage, assassination, overload, sabotage, and damping. Keep moving until Saren's husk is down to 25% health.
At that point, a short cutscene plays showing the remnants of the Citadel and human fleets desperately attacking Sovereign in space, but Sovereign shrugs off their firepower while retaliating with devastating effect. A human officer calls for a retreat, but Hackett countermands this, ordering his ships to keep firing as it is their only chance.
You regain control and Sovereign has restored Saren's shields but not his health. Just keep moving, using powers, and shooting until the Saren husk finally falls dead. When it does, it turns to dust and you are rewarded with the final cutscene.
Legendary Edition:  Although the Saren husk again plays the leading role, the final battle has been revised in Legendary Edition.
More cover has been added to the battlefield.
Saren summons waves of Geth Troopers, Geth Shock Troopers, and Geth Snipers. You will have to fend off these waves while also whittling down Saren's health.
The cut scene of the Citadel Fleet attacking Sovereign occurs when Saren reaches 50% health.
At least four waves are summoned by the avatar.
The battle ends instantly when Saren's health is reduced to zero.
An autosave is created just before Sovereign says ""This station is mine."" and Saren transforms into hopper form."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Find_Liara_T%27Soni,"Prerequisite: Citadel: Expose Saren
This mission is acquired after Shepard is given Spectre status by the Council and Shepard reports to Dock 422. Udina will say that Anderson is stepping down as the commanding officer of the SSV Normandy and that the ship is now commanded by Shepard.
When asking Captain Anderson about the mission, he will say that he has never been to the Artemis Tau Cluster so he wouldn’t know. He says to look for the world with the Prothean ruins.
Go to Therum in the Knossos system of the Artemis Tau Cluster.","Arrival on Therum[]
Geth dropships sure know how to arrive in style
The Normandy swoops down and drops the Mako on the planet. Therum is a volcanically active world. The Mako cannot survive even brief contact with the molten lava. Save your game here as a start save and move up. Joker will come over the radio saying that he is picking up some readings, “like off the damn charts” a few clicks, kilometers, north of the drop zone. Move up and around the path until you hear a Geth Dropship overhead. The dropship will deposit two Geth Armatures for you to fight.
Mako Tips: Remember that in the original Mass Effect, every kill made from outside the Mako gives more experience than a kill from inside the Mako. In Mass Effect Legendary Edition, there is no difference in XP gain.
The Armatures only target the very front of the Mako when they fire, so turning 90 degrees away and rocking back & forth is an excellent way to avoid most of their fire and keep your shield intact.
Another strategy is hitting the Armatures with the Mako and make them fall in the lava, which is an instant kill and gives the player the same XP as killing them on foot, but this requires timing to work.
Once both Armatures are down get back in the Mako and continue up the road. This is a good save point.
Refinery[]
After heading up the road a little, you will make a left turn and you will come under fire from three turrets outside an outpost labeled a refinery in the map. Depending on your squad makeup each will offer unique dialogue. Usually the first one to speak will say that a frontal attack is suicide, the other will say that there must be another way around. They're hinting that killing these three turrets is optional, so it's up to you whether you want to fight them for the extra experience. Meanwhile the turnoff currently to your right is your way forward when you're ready to proceed.
The ""alternate"" path is really the only way forward
Down the narrow turnoff you will find another single turret. Keep moving while you take it down. Then save your game before moving forward, as the upcoming fight can be difficult.
Combat Tip: On a high difficulty level where survival is at a premium, simply do not exit the Mako. The upcoming mass of geth is easily blown to kingdom come with your heavy guns. You will not receive optimum experience points if you do this (unless you are playing the Legendary Edition), although as usual you can quickly exit the Mako to put the final killing blow onto a nasty enemy to collect the full reward.
Inside the refinery, or sometimes boiling out from it, are some Geth Destroyers, Geth Troopers, Geth Rocket Troopers, Geth Shock Troopers, and one Geth Juggernaut. There are also some explosive materials around the camp, so use them to your advantage. Use the path to backpedal if you need to. Use your powers to take out the geth and above all keep moving to stay within cover. Using the Mako for cover is not recommended, because it will continue to take damage whenever it is hit. If the Mako appears “on fire” it has been completely damaged, so do not re-enter until all combat is over because even a single point of damage will destroy it.
Just be mindful of rockets slamming your way and you can beat them all easily
Once the remaining enemies are down reenter the Mako and drive it into the outpost. There are still two geth remaining, one inside either gatehouse. To your left as you enter the compound, you'll see the back of the original gates. Head into the building on the right-hand side of the gate. Move up slowly, send in your squad first to take the enemy out since the geth inside is rocket armed and can one-shot you on higher difficulty levels. Once it’s down grab the upgrade kit in the building. You can open the compound gate if you wish, though if you didn't take out the original three turrets they'll now be able to attack into the compound.
When you exit, move to the gatehouse on the other side of the now lowered gate to find an upgrade kit. You can also explore the industrial structures to the left to find two crates. Now get back in the Mako and head to the gates on the far side of the compound. To your right you'll find a crate (easy decryption), but the building on the right is empty. The building on the left has the gate controls and another geth. Follow the same routine, send in the squad first to lure it out, then fill it full of holes. Once done, open the weapons locker, and open the gates allowing you to continue.
To The Ruins[]
Big scary colossus looks little from a distance
Save your game before leaving. Once you leave you will come under fire from another Armature further along the path. Follow the same tactics as before to earn max exp. During this fight there will be another Armature further along the path that will be firing the whole time. When you advance far enough, two more will begin firing from across the lava pool to the left. Use the same tactics for all of them. Once you get past the two Armatures save your game because the next section features a powerful foe, a Geth Colossus.
When you get close enough you will come under attack by Geth Troopers and Geth Rocket Troopers. Once you are clear of the geth infantry focus your attention on the Colossus. Turn your Mako perpendicular to the direction of the Colossus and rock from side to side to avoid its powerful shots. Then head up the ramp and into the tunnel.
Once you get through the tunnel, there will be two Rocket Troopers at the other end. These are a pushover on foot so get out and push them over. Then head through the open area to the next tunnel and enter it. There are two more Rocket Troopers about half way down the tunnel, and then just past the other end of the tunnel are some more Rocket Troopers and a Geth Trooper. Take them out any way you wish then proceed.
With the right sort of acrobatics even the Mako can fit in here
You finally reach a point where the Mako can't get past but you have two options here:
Option 1: Look at the Mako's radar screen to get an idea of how geth forces are placed as your personal radar will be subjected to jamming once you disembark. Exit the Mako and proceed on foot.
Option 2: It is possible to squeeze the Mako through that narrow slit[1][2][3]. Approach the slit slowly, head-on. After the nose of the Mako comes in contact with the walls of the slit, push into it full throttle. After a few minutes of wiggling side-to-side at full throttle, you should be able to squeeze the Mako through and into the area behind the slit. This is also possible in Mass Effect Legendary Edition[4] and is easier to do with the addition of the rear boosters. Save first as it is possible to get wedged sideways in the slit and not be able to go forward, backward or get out of the Mako.
Bringing the Mako will make things easier and will just about guarantee survival.
Note: If you ride the Mako all the way up to the battle with the Armature, the geth in that battle will just stand there doing nothing[5]. This glitch is fixed in Legendary Edition.
Beyond The Rock Barrier[]
After you proceed, the next area is filled with geth. Troopers, Rocket Troopers, and Shock Troopers who will give you and the squad a warm reception. Use the large rocks that are around for defense and take them out. On higher difficulties the geth will deploy shield barriers so you will have to shoot through them, but they like to run around them, so usually just wait. Once all the geth in this area are down, save your game before moving on.
The geth have height advantage, though you can disabuse them of that notion with your own guns and talents
When walking around the bend, watch out for a targeting laser, as a Geth Sniper is on a tower in the next area and has full view. Find cover for you and your team and begin systematically eliminating the geth in the basin. Watch for the Rocket Troopers in this area, especially if Shepard is in the front. Their splash damage can sometimes kill you. The sniper makes this area difficult. It is best to use a Throw or Singularity directed at the tower as that will usually send the sniper falling to its death. Also shooting at it with Overkill, Marksman, or Assassination will work too. If necessary you can send the squad ahead to ""take one for the team"" and then once the Sniper's Assassination beam fires come around the corner yourself and quickly knock it out.
Once the sniper is down move your squadmates into the basin and to the first large rock. That provides them with cover and if you keep Shepard on the hill, then you have the height and once all the geth fall head up the road an up to the next area. You can actually kill the geth that are hiding behind the barriers before you reach the upper level if they are aggressive or you stand back enough in the basin. Once all the geth in the area are down, head up the road, but save before approaching the facility, as a tough fight awaits you.
Ruins Exterior[]
The mining camp exterior
When you get close enough to the mine, a cutscene shows Shepard and the squad heading towards the ruins. On a catwalk overlooking the site, a Geth Hopper hangs from the underside. When the squad gets nearer, it wakes up, looks at the squad, then hops around while the squad passes under it.
A loud rumbling then signals the arrival of a dropship. The squad turns and watches it as it proceeds to drop off more troops: two snipers and two shock troopers. There are two Geth Hoppers already around so you have six infantry troops. The final enemy that drops is an Armature. Now you have seven enemies: six infantry and one walking tank.
Once you regain control, move immediately to the left and have your squad take cover far to the left out of sight of the Armature – this will prevent them from being killed by the Armature which would deny you the use of their all-important abilities. Put Shepard behind the nearest crate to the left.
On lower difficulties you can focus on the Armature while your squadmates focus on the other infantry. Just watch out for the shock troopers and snipers because they will advance on your position down the middle. Take them out first if your squadmates don’t because if they get behind you, it won’t be pretty.
Warning:  It may occur to you to try and skip this fight and race for the entrance to the ruins, but you will be disappointed to find the door leading inside is locked. It will not unlock until you have eliminated all but a small number of enemies outside (around 2-3). This does mean you can potentially skip taking out the Armature if you find it too intimidating or you just want to get on with it, but you will miss out on potential XP and item drops.
Fighting them head-on is practically suicide, fortunately there are plenty of boxes for use as cover
Combat Strategy: You need to get rid of all the infantry before you can afford to engage the Armature – you just won't be able to safely put enough damage on it while dodging sniper and rocket fire to keep it from continually regenerating its shield. Use your squadmates abilities to pick away at the geth – note that abilities like Throw and Lift are useful for making the hoppers stand still. Try to completely overwhelm each geth infantry one by one – Overload their shields and then concentrate fire, because they don’t have much health beneath those shields but the shields will recharge if given any respite. Conveniently they will try to come forward to flank you, but this will give you an easier angle of fire without exposing yourself so much to the Armature, and may bring your squadmates’ guns into play as well.
Legendary Edition:  Enemies are more aggressive in infiltrating your position, so pulling Shepard back to the rear-most crate may make things more manageable.
Just be careful when you lean out because an Armature’s pulse cannon is often capable of taking you down in one hit; even splash damage can be lethal, so it's advisable to spread your team out to prevent any collateral damage. So move to the left when it is preparing to fire then back once the pulse passes. Using Sabotage on the Armature will help keep its big gun quiet long enough to get some shots in. Keep your squadmates in cover because the second they move out they will be targeted by the Armature. Whenever you get the Armature's shields down, pound it with as much damage as you can, because that damage won't repair. Eventually the Armature will fall, so proceed into the ruin in the aftermath.
Prothean Ruin[]
The entrance tunnel is long and steeply sloping downwards. When the catwalk at the end comes into view, you'll encounter some Geth Shock Troopers and Geth Snipers. There are a few containment cells that can help thin out the numbers.
Once they are down, head down the catwalk and eventually you reach a forcefield with no way to bypass it. Take the nearby elevator down and once it gets to the next level head off to the right to grab a med kit.
These things shredded Jenkins, so don't underestimate them
On the next level, once you start heading towards the next elevator, take cover because three Geth Assault Drones will come up from below. Overload, Sabotage, AI Hacking, Stasis, and gunfire will make short work of them. Once they are destroyed, head to the next elevator.
The Geth Drones shouldn't be too much trouble, but an alternative tactic involves rushing past them and activating the elevator, which ends any further combat though at the expense of exp gains. Use your squad's talents to distract or suppress the drones if you try this.
This second elevator has a problem and it starts to short-circuit as you go further down. The elevator screeches to a halt, so you must exit it and go down the broken platforms near a forcefield. Behind this forcefield is a floating asari. You can initiate a conversation with her once you get close enough.
The clumsy doctor who would go on to become a figure of galactic importance
She asks who you are and you can answer her questions as you like. You discover that this is indeed who you are searching for. Liara T'Soni is trapped in a Prothean security device when she tried to protect herself from the geth, but she must have pressed something she wasn't supposed to, so she needs your assistance to get out. You can ask about Matriarch Benezia, but she claims she hasn't talked to her mother in years.
When you have all the information you need, she says that the console next to her will disable the field. She can't think of a way past the barriers so you will have to solve it instead. Liara also warns that there are more geth being led by a krogan.
Once you regain control turn around and head down the catwalks to the left. In the pit below are some more geth:. a sniper, two troopers, and two shock troopers.
Don't forget to loot the containers behind the geth
Combat Tip: You won't have a problem here unless you take a rocket in the face or get one-shotted by the sniper. The sniper often stays way back where he has an excellent line of sight to get some nasty shots in, so be careful when you walk out from behind a rock. Consider sending your squad ahead to flush him out.
Once all these are down head to the back of the pit to recover a weapons locker and a storage locker from the tents. Once you have the loot head over to the terminal next to the mining laser and enter the code:
On the Xbox 360 the code is ""A"", ""X"", ""B"", ""Y""
On the PC the solution is randomly generated each time a saved game is loaded.
On the PS3 the code is ""X"", ""Square"", ""Circle"", ""Triangle""
Legendary Edition: On the Xbox the code is ""A"", ""X"", ""B"", ""Y"", ""X""
Legendary Edition: On the PC the code is arrow keys ""down"", ""left"", ""right"", ""up"", ""left""
Legendary Edition: On the PS4 the code is ""X"" ""Square"", ""Circle"", ""Triangle"", ""Square""
Could've been more useful against the geth if the laser was a bit more mobile
Once you enter the code, a short cutscene will play showing the laser burrowing into the ground and creating a tunnel to allow you to get past the barrier curtains. Go down into the tunnel, and access the console in the center to raise the elevator to Liara’s level. You need to talk to Liara to disable the console. You can ask again about Benezia, if you didn't before.
A tremor in the mine then occurs, which Liara attributes to the ruins' instability and that the mining laser must have triggered a seismic event. You will tell Joker to get the Normandy over to the ruins as quickly as he can make it. There is an auto-save here if you have it turned on, then the elevator will rise to the highest level.
Getting Out[]
The battlemaster would rather have a fight than an unsatisfying surrender, and you'll give it to him
Just when you think you are free, you arrive at the top level to a stand-off with a krogan and some geth. You can answer him any way you like but no matter your choices it will always lead to a fight. There are two Geth Shock Troopers, a Geth Rocket Trooper, a Geth Sniper, and a Krogan Battlemaster to deal with.
If the mission is done early, this fight can be extremely difficult. The Battlemaster in particular is the one enemy that you should beware the most, as he can massacre you and your team in one or two hits once he starts charging.
The battlefield is a circular room with very few places to hide. The pillar to the southwest can provide cover from most of the geth and the Battlemaster. Warning:  Each pillar occasionally releases a cloud of steam which will damage characters huddled against it, however. Interposing the pillar between Shepard and the enemies without getting formally into cover is one way to mitigate this effect.
Beating the Battlemaster's gang is now trivial in Legendary Edition compared to frustrating in the original game regardless of difficulty
Legendary Edition:  Additional crates have been added to the field, providing more obstacles against the Battlemaster's rampage and against geth weapons in general.
First take out the Shock Trooper on the other side of the room. Then, quickly turn around as the second Shock Trooper will approach behind you. Be wary, the geth can flank your team easily in this room. The Sniper will normally remain where it spawns.
Combat Tips: The geth won’t target Shepard with anything deadly in the first couple of seconds, so take the opportunity while the geth are all standing exposed and out of cover to whip off some can't-miss abilities like AI Hacking, Overload, Lift, and perhaps one quick volley before running for cover. Rocket Troopers have that peculiar combination of deadly attack and weak defense that makes them great to take out (and/or hack) early.
Also consider putting something tough and nasty like a Shock Trooper into Stasis if you have it to keep the numbers down. Don't worry about the Battlemaster yet because he won't start aggressively closing range and charging until most or all of the Geth are down. Once a couple of geth are down, make an effort to flush the sniper out of his hiding place before the Battlemaster starts charging, as fleeing from the Battlemaster while under sniper fire gets pretty dicey. The sniper can be dealt with via grenades, by sending the squad over, or even by running over and (carefully) doing it yourself – fortunately snipers don’t live long once you have a clear shot at them.
Once all geth are taken out, or the sniper is the only one left, the Battlemaster will usually charge right at you. Be alert for this moment as he can take out the whole squad within a matter of seconds. Biotics and/or Neural Shock can be utilized to disable him. Lift is probably the most dramatic ability in this combat, because if deployed when the krogan is charging he will go flying across the room away from you with all his momentum, and if deployed when he is almost dead will allow you to prevent him from regenerating. In any event, take every opportunity to knock him off his feet, and then fill him with holes while he’s trying to get up. If the squad has insufficient crowd-control capabilities, then keep on the move, and run and gun. Consider turning Squad Power Use off or to defensive abilities only from the menu to preserve your squad's important abilities for when you need them.
Run!
Be careful because like all krogan if he is not killed in the air, the Battlemaster gets a second life once his HP is depleted. Try to either kill him in the air, or blast him as soon as he falls.
Once the last enemy falls, a cutscene shows the squad and Liara waiting at the barriers. Another shake drops them and they start running. The ruins are collapsing around the squad as they make for the exit. They only stop once they are out of the ruins, and the Normandy is hovering above them."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Noveria:_Matriarch_Benezia,"Prerequisite: Noveria: Geth Interest
You'll learn from your first talk with Gianna Parasini that Matriarch Benezia is on Peak 15 on behalf of Saren.","The first part of this sprawling mission entails getting a garage pass in order to leave Port Hanshan and reach her. See Noveria: Leave Port Hanshan and/or Noveria: Lorik Qui'in for details.
Once you have the pass, head over to the Mako parked at the garage.
Port Hanshan Garage[]
The ERCS guard at the garage entrance will allow you through once you explain you have authorization. Save before proceeding, because as you might have guessed, there are geth in the garage. Two Geth Destroyers and two Geth Stalkers will attack you.
Geth do not infiltrate - other people sneak them in
Initially the geth will not have detected you, so you can quickly position your squad behind cover and prepare for the Destroyer rush. Use the piece of cover near the door to your advantage, along the explosive crates laying around, to take down the attacking geth.
If you are playing the original version of Mass Effect and want to make this fight easier, you can unlock the M29 Grizzly's cannon and use it to your advantage. However, this will result in fewer experience points. You could defeat most of the geth first, unlock the Grizzly for experience points, then exit it and finish off the geth. You cannot access the Grizzly after the fight. Legendary Edition:  The Grizzly cannot be unlocked and used in Mass Effect Legendary Edition.
Once they all fall, Maeko Matsuo enters the scene with a few guards and wants to question Shepard about the incident. Be as flippant or straightforward as you want, your squadmates may have some input of their own here. At the conclusion of the conversation, Matsuo leaves and you are free to take the Mako at the end of the garage to Peak 15. There is an upgrade kit near the M29 vehicle.
Note:  This is the last convenient opportunity to switch out squadmates through the Normandy, while you're still relatively near the ship. You can technically do so further down the mission, but the distances involved will make for a tedious trip back.
Aleutsk Valley[]
It's a long winding drive from Port Hanshan offscreen to the right to Peak 15 to the left
Once you leave a notification will come up that you have entered a Level 1 Cold Hazard; the landing party will need to limit their exposure outside the vehicle during the drive to Peak 15, unless you or one of your guys have Devlon Industries armor equipped. This ride will not be uneventful, but is relatively easy: the path is a series of U-turns where you have mountain walls on one side and cliffs on the other throughout the trip. Don't fall off the edge!
Head out of the garage and down the path. Eventually you'll approach an abandoned M29 Grizzly with a crate beside it. Continue along the path and you will run across another abandoned Grizzly, with a crate and a medical kit beside it.
Taking a scenic winter trip while blasting down enemies
Near this second Grizzly is the first tunnel you'll go through. The geth have placed a turret at the entrance and further barricaded the tunnel with three layers of troops and hex shields. The first layer is by the entrance, composed of four Geth Shock Troopers. The second layer is around the middle of the tunnel, composed of four Geth Rocket Troopers. There are also two upgrade kits at this location, though you may loot them later after dealing with the threats. The third layer at the end of the tunnel is just four more Rocket Troopers.
When you exit the tunnel, a cutscene plays, showing a Geth Armature on the road to your destination. It's near two stacked Grizzlies, one of which is burning, and it also has some Rocket Trooper friends. Take out the Rocket Troopers then focus on the Armature. There are two crates (Easy Decryption) beside the burning Grizzly.
Anything can melt given the right kaboom
Move on until you reach the next tunnel, which is defended by more geth. They're just two Shock Troopers, two Rocket Troopers and zero shields this time, clustered around the entrance. Outside the tunnel exit is a med kit, which may prove useful. Note:  Due to level geography you can see into the second tunnel entrance (with some zooming) from the exit of the first tunnel. You can whittle the geth there down by sniping, or with the Mako's guns if reduced experience gains isn't an issue.
The only enemies from the second tunnel exit to the Peak 15 research facility entrance are four Geth Turrets. The first one is around the corner, at the next U-turn. The second and third are on the bottom end and second leg of the U, respectively. The last is above and to the left, on the mountain, of the Peak 15 garage door. Once you are done, save, and enter Peak 15.
Note: There is a possibility that you can't save the game since the Mako's large detection radius picks up the enemies inside the garage. Move the vehicle out of range, or exit and proceed on foot from a distance to reenable saving.
Peak 15 Garage[]
Before you enter the garage you may want to save your game as there are very few Auto-Save points here. Peak 15 evidently has the infrastructure to receive and park your Mako, though the garage door is currently blocked by a burning Grizzly so you'll have to proceed on foot and enter through the side door. The cold hazard and blizzard overlay will disappear when you enter the first room of the garage. When you move through the large door into the next room, get in cover quickly because you will come under fire.
They bring presents of the hard-hitting kind
The large room beyond holds a Geth Juggernaut, a Geth Repair Drone, and three krogan: two on the floor in the back, the other on the catwalk above and to the left. Legendary Edition:  The krogan in the catwalk has been replaced with a Geth Trooper. Note that you cannot backtrack out of the garage as the way you came in is locked until all enemies are down.
Take out the repair drone as soon as possible because it will repair the geth you are trying to destroy. Enemy behavior here is to hang back unless you or your buddies approach near enough (at which point they start charging towards you), returning fire when they see you or your team. The Juggernaut however will proceed towards you when it sees you. Legendary Edition:  The Juggernaut also stays put in Legendary Edition and the krogan have a more pronounced tendency to seek cover instead of moving around in the back, meaning your sniper rifles and other long-distance warfare tools may find their niche use here against all enemies.
The room has numerous boxes for cover, two Cryo Containment Cells, and lots of space to maneuver: you shouldn't have much problem safely dealing with enemies whatever your playstyle.
The second the last enemy falls, the station's VI Mira comes over the intercom telling you of the amount of damage that the facility has sustained, in case that wasn't apparent. The loot items in the garage are a secure crate (Average Decryption) and an upgrade kit on the catwalk leading to the next room.
Peak 15's designers really like their tubular passageways
When you enter the security tunnel your squadmates will comment about the turrets facing the wrong way. There are only two places to go: the elevator to the next level, and the security office. The security office has an upgrade kit and a secure storage locker (Average Decryption).
The elevator leads to the administration level, specifically Peak 15's cafeteria. The area you arrive in is a good place to save as your radar will have detected enemy signatures in the next room. The next door auto-opens, potentially alerting your enemies, so proceed only when you're ready.
Surely robots have no need to eat
The cafeteria has some non-edible guests: some Geth Troopers and a Geth Shock Trooper. There is little cover near your starting location though there are numerous overturned tables in the mess that doubles as obstacles, so move into the room if necessary while using abilities to keep the geth from concentrating too much fire on your squad while you take them out. There's an explosive Fire Containment System canister nearby, though it might be useful later.
When all the geth are down an autosave is generated and a cutscene ensues. You hear some grating noises, causing your squadmates to speculate on the cause. Soon enough a new insectoid enemy is introduced; a large organic one at that. When you regain control, it's advisable to equip your toxic damage protection and anti-organic ammo immediately. Afterward, move away from the stairs because some Rachni Workers will come charging down them. Watch out for the tiny green fast-moving bugs: if they get near you, they explode and poison you at the same time.
Set aside a budget for exterminators or your infestation problem grows
After dealing with the workers, engage the two larger Rachni Soldiers upstairs: you may want to bait them with your squadmates as their poisonous acid spittle bypasses shields. If you have biotic skills then use them because these large rachni are extremely vulnerable to physics-based attacks.
Once the initial wave is down your squadmates will react with confusion about this new enemy. If you decide to inspect the upper chambers, up to two more Rachni Soldiers emerge from grates to ruin your day. The chamber with a snowed-in entrance right above the stairs has a terminal pertaining to UNC: Asari Diplomacy (if you haven't yet talked to Nassana Dantius about it, otherwise the terminal is inaccessible) as well as a Rachni Soldier bursting from a grate. The next chamber has a gravitic weapons research terminal (Codex entry for Disruptor Torpedoes) as well as a storage locker (Easy Decryption). The next chamber, near the elevator to Mira Core, has a med kit and another Rachni Soldier ready to burst from a grate.
Proceed to the elevator once you're done looting.
Fix Peak 15[]
Main article: Noveria: Peak 15
Pay attention to the overhead signs; they denote which way you're supposed to be going
From the elevator, you emerge near the VI core of the station. As the door opens, another mob of Rachni Workers will approach from the other end of the room--take them out before they have a chance to explode all over you. Once they are down, one of your squadmates will comment that nearby is what appears to be a backup power system for the station's VI.
The main source of the outage at Peak 15 comes from the offline VI. When you get it back up and running, it will inform you of additional tasks to perform before you can move on: Noveria: Reconnect Landlines and Noveria: Reactor Repair. Each time you repair something, a Rachni Soldier will emerge from a grate to the left and on the far side of the room. Take it down and move on across the room.
Once you've got both the landlines and the reactor repaired, you're ready to head down the tunnel toward the tram. However, Mira lays another problem on you. You will have to deal with the Noveria: Contamination mini-mission first before proceeding.
Once that mission's done, open the door on the other end of the decon chamber and quickly backtrack if you can: there are four Rachni Workers waiting on the other side.
With no further enemies for now, you can leave Central Station via tram and into the next area: Rift Station.
Rift Station[]
Main article: Noveria: Rift Station
A bunch of rachni periodically assault Captain Ventralis and his men
When your tram arrives there will be no enemies and only one way to proceed. Head around the corner and up the elevator to the Science Station, where you'll run into Captain Ventralis with a couple guards. You can ask him about the situation and what has been happening. They're on lockdown for a good while now, and are pretty serious in not letting anyone breach their tenuous security. When you end the conversation he will give you a pass card to the Hot Labs, an area which is back down the elevator behind you.
More rachni suddenly appear during the conversation. Take them out with Ventralis' help and then move on into the station. Alternatively, you can turn tail deeper into Rift Station and let Ventralis and his men take care of the problem. He notices this and will adjust his dialogue accordingly the next time you talk to him.
At this point you can do one of two things: follow the lead from Ventralis and head back down the elevator to the hot labs, or explore the main level behind him. If you do the latter, you may obtain additional considerations in getting to Benezia. This is important, because the story will unfold a bit differently for each decision. See Noveria: The Hot Labs if you wish to take Ventralis at his word.
Sleeping quarters ain't one without lootable containers
In the main level mess hall/makeshift holdout you'll find several people you can talk to: Alestia Iallis, Petozi, Dr. Palon, and some other scientists and guards clearly chafing under the stress. Petozi the elcor merchant has a limited list of items for sale, though more usefully you can sell him anything that's clogging your inventory. On the right a door leads to the Guard Barracks - head inside and crack the storage and weapon lockers there (both on easy decryption).
There are three other doors on the left, when entering the mess hall. The first leads to the Quarantine and Barracks, the second leads down to the Medical Bay, the third leads to a sealed-off section of the base. Dr. Zev Cohen at the Med Bay requires assistance and will give you the Noveria: Quarantine mission if you accept. Wandering near the restricted area updates your journal with the Noveria: Rift Station entry. Be warned that hacking the door here (easy decryption) will turn all the guards against you.
In any event, you will need to go to the Secure Lab marked on your map through any means necessary. See the aforementioned link for details.
The Matriarch[]
Have you faced an Asari Commando unit before? Few humans have...
The Secure Lab is marked by the overhead sign sporting an Erlenmeyer flask. Warning:  This is the final point of no return for the entire mission. Once you get inside, you'll be unable to backtrack and the mess hall will be forever locked out. Loot every crate you may have missed on the way, transact with Petozi one last time, if you must switch squadmates then take the long trip back to the Normandy, and finally, save.
Inside is Matriarch Benezia on an upper platform. You can talk to her and get a few questions answered. If you have Liara in your party, there are some words exchanged between mother and daughter. Once you are done Benezia will place the whole squad in Stasis while her Asari Commandos move into position. When you regain control you'll find yourself in the middle of what's arguably the most difficult battle in the game.
The entire battle with Benezia consists of 3 waves, with her dishing out biotic and pistol fire from her static position while her minions engage you in the catwalk-framed room. Benezia is invulnerable at this time, defeat all three waves to weaken her. Being caught in accumulated enemy biotics is never a good idea, and you'll be facing powerful ones here. Fortunately the structure of the room is such that you can easily identify places that block Benezia's attacks, giving you relatively safe positions for counterattacking the minions. Additionally, a bottomless pit rings the center of the room. Physics-based attacks biotic or otherwise pointed at the pit's general direction goes a long way in dispatching enemies although be warned that this is a two-way street and it can easily be you who may end up flopping or flying out of bounds.
All of them simultaneously flaring up biotically is always bad news, so make sure they don't
The first wave consists of two Asari Commandos. They come directly in front of you. Don't let them unleash their biotics; disable them ASAP before they have a chance to hit you with disablers of their own.
The second wave consists of two Asari Commandos and two Geth Snipers. At this point you'll have familiarized yourself with the terrain and can move in whichever direction most advantageous to your style, then along comes the snipers' radar jamming. Consider equipping your most powerful detection upgrade on your weapons to counter it, as it will see continued usage later.
The third wave consists of 8 Geth Snipers divided into two groups. Benezia is visibly weakening at this point. If you move quickly you can often catch a group of four all in the same Singularity, Lift, etc.
Once they are all down you will begin another conversation with Benezia. She will start out defiant but her attitude changes quickly. Benezia says that the real threat is Sovereign and that Saren is just a tool. Ask questions and Benezia says that Saren sent her here to recover the location of the Mu Relay from the Rachni Queen. You can ask more questions, but eventually the indoctrination overpowers Benezia and she and three final Asari Commandos attack. When the last enemy falls, a final dying conversation with Benezia occurs. When she passes, the mission entry is renamed into Noveria: Death of a Matriarch if you have some loose ends to tie up.
Legendary Edition:  The confrontation has been redefined with different enemy headcounts and behavior compared to the original. The room has been slightly redesigned as well, with only two levels of elevation (Benezia's platform and doors) compared to three in the original (Benezia's platform, doors, and a depressed area next to Benezia's platform accessible via stairs).
Well this is new...During the first three waves, Benezia will be surrounded by a large hemispheric biotic shield, which better demonstrates her immunity from attacks, and she no longer launches attacks biotic or otherwise.
The first wave still consists of two Asari Commandos. However, they throw disabler attacks with less frequency.
The second wave consists of two Asari Commandos, one Geth Sniper, and three Geth Troopers. They all start from the corner diametrically opposite from the location you entered the room.
The third wave consists of a Geth Destroyer with three Geth Troopers in one corner, whereas the opposite corner contains a Geth Sniper, a Geth Shock Trooper, and two Geth Troopers. This will likely result in your being attacked from both sides at once.
Benezia attacks alone at the end, without help from Asari Commandos. She will occasionally throw disablers at Shepard, if given the opportunity.
Loose Ends[]
Main article: Noveria: Rift Station
There's still the issue of the Rachni Queen in the tank the Matriarch was busying herself about earlier. Approach it and decide its fate; you can't get out of the lab while this is pending.
Loot the boxes while you can, they no longer exist in Legendary Edition
You've been battling inside the room before you can properly survey it, so if you are playing the original Mass Effect and haven't attempted to raid the crates during the boss fight now would be the time to do so. On the center platform near Benezia's corpse is a secure crate (average decryption). On the lower platform adjacent to it are two more secure crates (both average decryption). Legendary Edition:  The room no longer includes the lootable containers that originally appeared there.
If you have not purged the remaining rachni yet, exit the Secure Lab and deal with them down at Noveria: The Hot Labs. This is completely optional, and the elevator down to Rift Station's main level is locked out anyway, so this is the only other possible loose end.
When you've finished with the place, use the tram to leave."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Feros:_The_Thorian,"Prerequisite: Feros: Geth Attack
Feros: Geth Attack is renamed to its present form after the talk with the ExoGeni VI. This is the second leg of the main Feros story arc.","Escaping ExoGeni HQ[]
You can chat with the ExoGeni VI as many times as you wish to review the information it possesses. When you are done talking to it, head out into the only other corridor available (there's no point backtracking to confront Lizbeth Baynham about the Thorian as she has no new dialogue available). Keep your highest-level Detection Upgrade installed on one of your active weapons as you'll have extensive use for it.
Even AIs have their own cultists
Eventually you arrive at a room where you'll see two Geth Shock Troopers bent over in what appears to be prayer to a glowing orb. Dropping down from the platform is a one-way trip as Shepard cannot climb over those stone steps, so don't do it if you still have any reason to backtrack. The second you start shooting the geth rise and return fire, although it may be a useless gesture because if you are fast enough you can take them out before they do.
Once the geth are down a small cutscene commences where your squadmates comment about the claws that are holding the Geth Dropship to the building. Investigate the orb: your squadmates give their opinions, but nothing tangible is gained, so loot the locked crate nearby (easy decryption) and move on.
Clear them out now so you'll have a clean exit later
The next area you enter will be the main entrance to the facility. It's the area beyond the shield you first saw upon arriving from the skyway, and it is protected by a group of geth: a Geth Trooper, a Geth Shock Trooper, a Geth Sniper, and a Geth Stalker. It's a small but moderately tall room, though there is some cover here to lean on aside from retreating into the corridor. Be wary of possible Sabotage + Assassination combos, you will not want to get caught flatfooted with disabled weapons and a potential one-hit kill aimed at you.
When the geth are down, you have two directions to take your squad next: across from where you came in, or a U-turn left from where you came in (looking at your map, east or northwest). Northwest is the actual route forward while east is a dead end with some exp and loot. Consult Feros: Data Recovery if you obtained the assignment from Gavin Hossle and/or you want to explore the eastern route.
Hoppers rarely stand still for the group picture
The northwest route is a straightforward stroll up some stairs and a corridor. When you start seeing red dots in your radar (or if it's jammed due to inadequate Detection Upgrades) note the secure crate (average decryption) nearby. You'll emerge in a long spacious chamber partitioned by a dropship claw, though you can get to the other side via stairs later. The first section has a motley gang of defenders: a Geth Sapper, a Shock Trooper, and two Troopers usually, with a Geth Sniper lurking in the rear. There's a fusion containment cell you can shoot when they start moving.
The geth have set up some sort of containment lab with a lot of computers in this long room, hence you can acquire several assignments from the consoles provided you haven't gotten or finished them yet. In the first section there's an ExoGeni terminal (average decryption) that gives the assignment Investigate Facility, the rest are on the other side. Head up the stairs and about halfway through your squadmates will comment on the claw in the middle of the room. Then the camera pans to the other end of the room where a Geth Destroyer is patrolling and keeping watch over 2 Shock Troopers, 1 Trooper, 1 Sniper, 1 Geth Rocket Trooper, and a Geth Ghost. An autosave is generated after the camera pan, though if you want a manual save you may have to walk all the way down to the main entrance to get rid of enemy sightings on radar (or alternatively, load the autosave and initiate a manual save afterward).
They have the numbers, you have the skill
When you regain control, descend the stairs or just shoot to get the geth's attention and then the Ghost will jump out. Move around and backpedal if you need to, and take out the rest of the geth. Keep an eye on the Destroyer especially because it just loves to charge and melee the squad to death.
When the geth are down, move to the other side and loot the secure crate near the large claw (average decryption), then bypass a geth terminal (hard decryption) to get the assignment Geth Activities. If you have already been to the Armstrong Nebula then this console will not be available. Bypass a server node (average decryption) for the Investigate Samples assignment. Off to the side of the shuttle bay door control is a small chamber with a secure crate (average decryption). To continue the mission interact with the aforementioned shuttle bay door control.
The console note there says that the door to the shuttle bay is currently glitchy: it works fine at under 30 PSI, at 31-34 it can shear through a metal I-beam, and at over 35 PSI it automatically shuts down. Use the buttons to the left of this console to get to 31-34 PSI; anything under 30 is fine, but at 35 or over the system will reset. The 17, 11 and 5 buttons, or 13, 11 and 7 will be sufficient. When you get the proper combination, close the door and watch as the claw is sheared through and the dropship falls into the rubble that covers the planet's surface.
It's dropships all the way down
The cutscene jumps again to where the forcefield was. The blue field drops while one of your squadmates points out the obvious. Depending on which squadmates you brought, they will also make various tongue-in-cheek comments about the mission.
The second the dropship falls, Joker comes over the comm and apparently is desperate to contact the Commander. Reply and Joker will tell you that the colonists have gone crazy and are clawing at the Normandy's hull. You can respond but no matter the action the crew will stay in the ship to prevent the crazed colonists from getting in. He also says that there are a lot of geth heading Shepard’s way, so be prepared.
Head back up the stairs, check the area again if you missed any crates, and go back to the main room where the forcefield was. Meeting you there is Lizbeth Baynham and now you can confront her with the information you retrieved from the ExoGeni VI.
She confesses to knowing and she says the reason she stayed behind was to send a distress call but got cut off before the transmission was sent, so she hid. You can interrogate her further and she gives up all the details of the Thorian project and why she was suspended. She was apparently very vocal in expressing her displeasure with the project and what it was doing. When you are done, she wants to come back with you to try and help.
When you regain control Lizbeth has gone on ahead to board the Mako. True to Joker's warnings, more geth have positioned themselves along the skyway and are just looking to stop your squad from getting back.
Back on the Skyway, Part 1[]
They start bringing out the big guns on your way back
When you exit the ExoGeni garage, on the other side are two Geth Armatures and three Geth Juggernauts outside that are just waiting for you to come out. Deal with them, and there's plenty of room in the skyway for any variety of playstyle whether it's ignoring them, cautious evasion of every hit, or taking risks and being mobile, ramming/immobilizing them. They're the only enemies around for a while.
As you reach the Skyway Weigh Station again you hear another radio transmission from Juliana Baynham asking for help. Ethan Jeong is then heard warning her to get away from the radio. Lizbeth asks about it, then you hear Juliana again using a general distress call and then is cut off. When you get near the refugee camp a cutscene plays where Lizbeth asks for the Mako to be stopped. She exits and heads down the eastbound ramp immediately to your south, so exit the Mako and follow her. If you were on foot, you are put back in the Mako and the Mako is relocated here for the cutscene. The door to Zhu's Hope is locked, so you can't progress any further until you deal with this latest interruption.
ExoGeni Bunker[]
The bean counter has gone nuts
When you get far enough down the ramp a cutscene will play where Lizbeth and the squad are hiding and watching the action unfold. Jeong, clearly stressed, has begun asserting his authority as an ExoGeni representative. He has some of the ExoGeni Security restrain Juliana while she is telling him that he won't get away with this. Lizbeth jumps up, Shepard reaches to grab her, but misses. Juliana breaks off, runs to her daughter, and they hug.
Jeong orders Shepard and the squad out and they leave cover. If this is your first time meeting him, Jeong warns that you're intruding on an ExoGeni project and that he's taking control. Otherwise, Jeong claims he found some interesting things about Shepard in the ExoGeni database, which depend on your psychological profile. Because the comms have been restored, ExoGeni wants the colony purged and the colonists have a problem with that.
You have a few options from here. If you don't have the necessary morality points (10 Intimidate or 12 Charm), then you can't reason with Jeong and Shepard shoots him when he draws his pistol. If you have the necessary options then you can convince Jeong that saving the colony is worth ExoGeni's time and money, either by appealing to the ""against all odds"" approach (Paragon), or by threatening him with Shepard's Spectre status (Renegade).
ExoGeni guards refusing to take action if you killed Jeong
If you choose to use the options then Jeong will agree to support and expand the colony with ExoGeni resources. You bank a lot of morality points and can significantly impact the fate of the Feros colony. Juliana will ask to speak with you before you leave for Zhu's Hope. Otherwise, if Jeong died, the discussion immediately proceeds to the next issue.
If you managed to talk Jeong down then Juliana thanks you; if you shot him then she sees it as a bad sign because ExoGeni may pull out. She then asks you to spare as many colonists as possible, and after some talking she speculates that using a modified, sub-weapons-grade nerve gas might be the best thing to help take down the colonists because of their weakened immune systems. The gas will harmlessly incapacitate the colonists, as will melee attacks. Or you can just shoot them all.
In any case, you will obtain Anti-Thorian Gas grenades for the upcoming fights, and your responses to Juliana will only gain you additional Paragon or Renegade points. Getting the grenades is a prerequisite before the weigh station door back to Zhu's Hope is unlocked. Warning:  Unless you're certain you can live without it, do NOT sell or convert the Anti-Thorian gas to omni-gel. It is your only sample and cannot be obtained anywhere else.
If you have the data from Feros: Data Recovery, you can give it to Gavin Hossle now but you can still wait until after the mission for that. Alternatively, if you haven't spoken to Hossle before, you can still acquire the assignment from him.
Back on the Skyway, Part 2[]
When you are ready, board the Mako, head out of the Weigh Station and back on the last part of the skyway to Zhu's Hope.
They only look big and menacing up close
If it wasn't already obvious the geth are mounting a final defense to prevent Shepard from getting back. Out on the road are 2 Juggernauts and Armatures each. They're the last group of enemies on the skyway, deal with them either on foot or from the Mako same as you did with the earlier group. Note:  If you have inventory room to spare, this is your last opportune chance to stock up on items and exp with the infinitely unlockable crate beneath the skyway. The only limits are your patience and inventory space.
When you reach the skyway door, Shepard and the squad will observe a creature on the ground folded up like the geth in storage mode. It wakes up, stands up, and attacks. You automatically exit the Mako if you were in the vehicle so shoot the Thorian Creeper dead once you regain control. Do NOT let it get close, as its vomit can pierce through shields and kill you swiftly.
When it falls your squadmates ask what it was and you have two options that do affect your squad's next actions. If you choose the “Don’t shoot the colonists” dialogue option, then your squadmates will only fire on the creepers and not the colonists. (Note that squadmates with shotguns may accidentally catch colonists in their blasts.) The other option will cause your squadmates will shoot at everything including the colonists. If you're set on killing the colonists your squadmates ask you to confirm, giving you one more time to change your mind. A display in the lower right hand corner will let you know how many colonists are still alive, starting at 16. Note:  Allowing squadmates to shoot everyone may result in a bug that will make the colony fail later on no matter what. See Bugs for more details.
The number of colonists you kill will have an impact on the colony's ultimate fate. An autosave is generated right afterwards, and it is recommended you also manually save before you open the door. Equip the Anti-Thorian Gas grenades if you're planning to use them.
Surprise Opponents[]
Nobody said it's illegal to run zombies down
When you regain control open the garage door. You'll encounter 10 Thorian Creepers, plus Ian Newstead, May O'Connell, and 2 unnamed Colonists, all hostile and under the Thorian's control. The creepers awaken from standby mode in waves, so you'll have to buckle down for a bit. The elevator to Zhu's Hope is disabled until you've dealt with all enemies in the garage. For safest results quickly jump back in the Mako: its guns, especially the cannon, will make quick work of everyone with no danger to you.
Be careful not to target the colonists behind the barricades on the upper level inside the garage if you're trying to save them. For preserving exp gain on pre-Legendary Edition playthroughs, you can always use the time-honored tactic of periodically using the Mako's guns to shorten the creepers' lives before hopping off the vehicle to finish them on foot. The Anti-Thorian Gas grenades have an effect range of a few meters: they are one-hit kills for the creepers and will render the colonists unconscious. Note:  If you're conserving the grenades, you can relax a little as there's one +5 refill back at the colony; otherwise, you can melee the civilians as that also knocks them unconscious instead of killing them.
Tip: If you're trying to keep colonists alive, using Sabotage on them can halt their attacks and usually won't do enough damage to kill them, but biotics can be fatal to them especially if they get removed from the map. Also avoid equipping explosive ammo upgrades especially on your squadmates as the splash damage and explosive force can easily kill the colonists.
Gassing people to keep them alive isn't usually in the same chain of cause and effect
If you're playing Paragon, fling a grenade at the colonists. They're usually clumped in groups; aim for the middle guy to increase your chance of taking down all of them in one shot. If you're playing Renegade you can just shoot the colonists and save the grenades for when you're under pressure from multiple Thorian Creepers. Lots of morality points are to be had, and what you'll have depends on the number of colonists saved or killed. You will get the final tally once all 16 colonists are accounted for; for now you'll only get experience points upon successful kill or knockdown.
Note:  If you're trying to save the colonists, there is a glitch where melee attacks and gas grenades sometimes fail to permanently knock them out of the fight; however, if you then kill them with guns they are still counted as ""saved"" and the Colonists Alive counter won't go down.
When the creepers are biodegrading and the colonists are either dead or safely incapacitated, head to the elevator. Note:  Once you use it, the elevator will be disabled afterwards, so this is your last chance to return towards ExoGeni Headquarters to deal with anything you left undone (e.g. item crates or assignment acquisitions and/or completions).
Another autosave is generated on loading the next level. When you exit the elevator go around to the left (south going by map directions). Waiting are 3 creepers, Davin Reynolds, and Calantha Blake. Use a grenade to take them all out quickly or just shoot them. The creepers will not rise until a certain amount are down and they will rise in order but if you gas the two colonists that are behind the barrier then they will all get up. On higher difficulty levels retreat slowly from the creepers while shooting them to avoid facing too many at once.
The Colonists Fight Back
Down the stairs are 2 more creepers. Beyond the corridor and into Zhu's Hope proper you'll find the defensive barriers manned by four colonists—two of them being Arcelia Silva Martinez and Hollis Blake—and 3 more creepers.
When you have dealt with the enemies at the gate, move up and around. The Borealis will be locked so you can't go through it, so head right and up to the elevated catwalk. Near the catwalk steps there is an upgrade kit on the ground that will give you five grenades to use wisely; if you still have a full or near-full arsenal expend some grenades before returning here and opening the box so that you get the maximum benefit.
Greta Reynolds and Ledra guard the catwalk along with 3 creepers: if you have some trades with Ledra later you'll want to leave him alive. When you get to the other side, the open area next to Borealis, there are 9 creepers and the last 4 colonists: Macha Doyle and Hana Murakami among them. Your squadmates will notice the freighter crane controls are also here, which will open up a path to the Thorian. Activating it while in combat is not allowed so deal with the hostiles first.
Once the creepers wake up, retreat from the area. The colonists never try to pursue you but the creepers do, and this will leave you free to separate the killables from the optionally killables. Once all the creepers are down return and you will be able to precisely grenade or melee the colonists. Warning:  Because creepers and colonists ragdoll easily be judicious in gunning them down close to the freighter especially if using mods with knockback. You might end up with them being stuck inside the freighter, which will prevent you from accessing the crane controls.
When they are all down one way or the other, walk over to the crane controls and activate them. A cutscene then ensues where a section of the freighter rises exposing a stairwell leading into the underworks of the colony. Shortly afterward Fai Dan comes around and says that the Thorian wants him to kill Shepard. While the pain is apparently immense, he still manages to resist and shoot himself in the head. Head down the stairs and you are treated to a cutscene where Shepard and the squad descend into the Thorian's lair amid an ominous and foreboding bass drone.
The Thorian's Lair[]
The Thorian, a plant at least 50,000 years old
An autosave is generated right after the cutscene. When you regain control you get your reward from either killing or subduing the colonists: +2 morality points for each colonist either killed or saved. Head down the stairs and just keep going because there will be no enemies yet. Before you reach the bottom, however, save the game, because a few steps forward later, a cutscene plays.
One of the squadmates starts talking about finding a central core, and the team is soon confronted with the enormity of the Thorian. You're given a chance to respond to the grotesque sight, but the outcomes are all the same. Shepard moves a bit closer, and subsequently the creature notices the team and expels a green-skinned asari clone.
An Asari Clone
The Asari Clone starts speaking to you, representing the fleshy mass of tentacles behind her, and demands you pay your respects to the Thorian. You can threaten the plant immediately, or suss out the Thorian's motivations. If the latter, the asari explains that the Thorian was attacked by Saren to prevent Shepard from gaining access to the knowledge to understand the Prothean Beacon's vision. The Thorian absorbed the essence of the Protheans and gave the knowledge to Saren in exchange for her and an understanding that the Thorian would be left alone. Saren broke the agreement and attacked, however, so the Thorian does not want to talk to any 'meat bags' such as the team.
Whatever the outcome, the conversation ends abruptly. You can gain +2 Paragon or Renegade depending on how you responded to the clone.
An autosave is generated right before you regain control. The first thing you should do in this fight is to Throw the asari off and into the abyss below the Thorian - safe disposal for a tough foe. In the absence of biotic shenanigans you can always use Damping and/or Sabotage to cripple her offensive threat. Then turn to the Thorian Creepers that are scattered around and use powers, gunfire, grenades, and well anything else to take them down - just don't let them get close. Two creepers start right in the room with you, but the instant you destroy them another door opens and more pour in.
The lair has a very open layout. Don't worry about overstepping and falling off the ledge yourself, the game has safeguards against it for player characters.
Level 1[]
Shoot the tentacle nodes to unseat the Thorian
When they are all down, one of your squadmates notices something in the next room, so go and investigate. In the room is a large ball of organic material that is attached to the wall, shoot it and the Thorian Neural Node will eventually be destroyed. The second that happens, the Thorian groans, or screams. Your squadmates think that hurt the creature and now you have to hunt down the rest of the nodes.
This sets the rhythm for the final leg of this mission: destroy the nodes, watch out for enemies. The ""boss"" for the entire lair is indeed the Thorian, though shooting at the main mass does nothing. If you notice the mass of the Thorian it's connected to multiple levels via thick tentacles, and you just injured one. The game won't let you sequence break by running past a node; there's always a door preventing access to the next section until the node has been dealt with.
There are 6 nodes in total, and there are certain restrictions on dealing with them:
Most biotic attacks cannot damage them, except Throw and Warp.
Tech talents like Overload are thrown via grenade discs, and they aren't triggered by proximity to a node (if they are triggered by creepers or clones the explosion doesn't damage the node).
Weapons deal more damage to nodes the closer you are to them, and they deal much less damage at long range.
You can see faraway nodes from certain vantage points, though you can't damage a node one level up if you haven't killed the one nearer to you yet. Guns and damage-dealing grenades work fine, though subject to the aforementioned proximity rules and the node doesn't suffer from ancillary effects like poison or fire damage.
Despite the name, Anti-Thorian Gas I does not work against a node, only on nearby creepers.
Multiple Thorian Creepers lie in wait and are scripted to either wake up on approach, on sensing damage to a node, or upon death of an already awake creeper. When you kill a node most active creepers are destroyed as well, though some that are in hibernation at the time may never awaken. Tip: If you are seeking maximum experience points from the lair, then before destroying a node make sure to wake all creepers in a given area first. Injure the node just enough to wake all creepers triggered by it, deal with the creepers, then sweep the area to trigger the on-approach creepers, deal with them too, then kill the node.
Now that the first node's destroyed, when you head upstairs to the next level a short cutscene plays where the Thorian produces another clone.
Combat Tips: Whatever the difficulty level, if you have a low level character, you will probably find this an extremely difficult scenario. However, there are always means to beat the odds with any variety of classes and squadmates. Here are some more tips for survival in the coming fights:
Consider equipping shotguns, even for squadmates who aren't trained in them. This will help knock creepers off their feet and slow their pursuit.
Use Hammerhead Rounds in your weapons if you have them (Sledgehammer Rounds even better, or High Explosive Rounds if you can manage the extra heat). Increases the chance of knocking creepers down, even if not used in a shotgun, and particularly creative shooting can push enemies off to the abyss.
Always take down the Asari Clone first whenever you see her. She's the only ranged opponent, her weapons are powerful, and her biotic knockdown can leave you helpless while creepers catch you and barf on you.
The Thorian splorts out another cloneA new Asari Clone spawns whenever you knock out a node, so be ready -- return to the safety of your squad and get your abilities ready to go. There are seven Asari Clones, counting the first one you talked to, for the six Thorian Neural Nodes.
Legendary Edition:  The Asari Clone no longer targets Shepard with her biotic knockdown ability; however, you can still get hit by it and incapacitated when she targets a squadmate.
Take this level very slowly. Rushing forward will spawn too many enemies too quickly. Whenever it's quiet, stop and wait for your party's abilities and health to recover. If there are no enemies on the radar, save.
Consider parking your squadmates in one of the relatively open spaces and carefully scouting ahead alone. This will keep your squadmates from getting killed which deprives you of the use of their all important abilities. When Shepard triggers new enemies, quickly return to where your squad is. This will cause the enemies to ""train"" out into a line and you won't have to fight as many as once. The dangerous Asari Clone in particular will tend to arrive well ahead of the creepers.
There are several vantage points from which you can gain line-of-sight on one of the Thorian nodes from across the center space. This gives you the chance to shoot it and take it out from safety - or at least provoke creepers to run at you one by one.
The mission terrain freely lends itself to interesting biotic attacks. Feel free to push enemies over to the open chasm on the sides. Chokepoints are also abundant for any holding action you may take, and since enemies tend to attack en masse Singularity users can have a field day here.
Your armor upgrade configurations should have a focus on toxin resistance, hardening, and/or physics threshold. Combinations of Medical Exoskeleton and Combat Exoskeleton and related upgrades should be a priority for your team's defense.
Did you manage to save any grenades? There are no grenade refills in the lair. The Anti-Thorian Gas I can take out a whole roomful of active creepers and therefore should be saved for the ultimate last resort.
Level 2[]
Beware of sleeping zombies
In the next level there's a long-range vantage point right after the stairs from below where you can see a weapons locker, a bunch of creepers, and maybe the clone. Look to your right (or south, consulting the map). If they're up and running you can take potshots from this far before they reach you via the nearby corridor.
The corridor next to the weapons locker is a rubble-filled stairs to the next level, which has the second node as well as another bunch of creepers on standby or wandering about. There's a fire hazard here, and it only damages you so don't go near it. If the asari is in the right position, then she can be thrown off into the chasm again. Once you have dealt with the creepers and the clone, go shoot the node. The door to the next level opens once the node's destroyed.
Level 3[]
There are certain vantage points amenable for long-distance node shooting in some levels
The next room contains even more creepers and another clone. If you are sneaky enough, then you can throw the clone off and then you only have to deal with the creepers. Move into the room and take out the creepers, then look to your left as you can see the node from here. The best way to deal with it is to shoot it from this room and deal with the creepers as they come, otherwise you can get overwhelmed very quickly.
Put your squadmates in cover near the door and start shooting the node and then deal with the creepers as they come down the tunnel. Eventually you will run out of creepers and the node will run out of health and blow up. Move into the room where the node was and then put your squadmates in cover near the door as the next room has more of the same. Just shooting down the tunnel should be enough to attract their attention, so deal with the creepers and the clone as they come. When you are done head into the large room, which has a medical station (easy decryption). Adjacent to it is another ruined stairway passage where the fourth node is located.
It's like the other uphill room, only with the orientation mirrored
The room with the node also contains 10-12 creepers and they will follow the usual ""waking up when you shoot the node so kill me now"" routine. Note:  If trying to maximize creeper kills, there always appears to be at least one left hibernating once the node is destroyed. Force the rest to wake by continuous shooting at the node while dealing less damage (meaning use your crappiest pistol) so as not to prematurely destroy it while there's more than one creeper still sleeping.
When all the creepers or the node is destroyed, head up the rubble and onto the next level. Remember that each time you destroy a node a new clone will spawn, so it's often wise to wait for her before advancing. If you can see on the radar that the enemies aren't advancing on you, a few shots fired in the air will often get them going.
Level 4[]
When you get up you can throw the clone or a creeper off the ledge. This room is spacious to the right (south going by map directions) while the fifth node is to the left (north), and the immediate area has a lot less enemies than the three previous ones. Take down the clone and creepers as they come, throw a few off for a few laughs, and then turn around and shoot the node, which is dangling rather defenselessly (the creepers it awakens are above you); you can even do that first, but you'll lose out on some exp rewards.
Five down, one to go once you take care of this
Once the node is destroyed head down you arrive at the first staircase (it's the same set of stairs for levels 1-2, only the direct path to level 4 is inconveniently blocked by two grills). Note:  Assuming you shoot this node before proceeding forward, the batch of sleeping creepers on the stairs ahead will awaken in your midst. However, if you proceed forward to the sealed doorway and then return to shoot the node, these creepers will never awaken. So, depending on whether you are going for maximum experience points or minimum risk, choose the scenario you prefer.
Head up the stairs and then you will be forced to deal with those creepers that you had to bypass earlier. They will wake up in droves and attack along with the clone while you are trying to climb the staircase to the last node. Take them down with abilities, gunfire, and any grenades you have left. When all the enemies are dead, resume climbing the stairs to the final level - though again, you have a vantage point of the last node from the stairs and you can take potshots at the node there if you prefer.
Level 5[]
Another long-range shooting vantage point if you don't want to slog through the last creepers in the level
Once on the top there are two rooms with creepers, and a final clone. Take down the ones in the middle and then get into cover and use the same tactics as before, or whichever tactics that work best for you. Note:  You can avoid the spawning of the seventh Asari Clone by shooting the final neural node at a distance from the next room and never approaching close to the room the node is in. This makes the final section a bit easier but lowers your experience reward.
When you have dealt with the final creepers, finish off the node. You're then treated to a cutscene of the nodes you destroyed collapsing and the Thorian falling into the abyss.
Shiala[]
Then the scene jumps to a pod-like structure at the far end of the last node and another asari - this time violet-skinned instead of green - falls out. She introduces herself as Shiala and she formerly served Matriarch Benezia. You'll learn that Saren came to get the Cipher and understand the disjointed images from the Beacon on Eden Prime. She tells you that Saren gave her to the Thorian in exchange for the Cipher and then tried to kill the Thorian to keep Shepard from getting to it. Apparently Saren knows that Shepard is searching for the Conduit and is doing everything possible to prevent that.
Shiala emerges from a pod
Shiala gives you the Cipher, which induces another Prothean Beacon-style montage of ominous imagery, and then her fate is in your hands. You can choose to kill her, or allow her to help the colony to recover, which will affect the colony's survival chances. If you want to get to know her, you can do so here, though if you let her live you can also do it after the mission. Either way you head back up to the colony automatically when the dialog ends.
The Fate of the Colony[]
The ExoGeni personnel are here from their bunker, and will greet you with either respect or distrust as you learn the consequences of your actions for the colony's future. Your results here can be predicted by a simple formula, as follows:
Colony health
For each sidequest completed (varren meat, geth in the tunnels, etc.), add 1
For each surviving colonist, add 1
Colony health is cumulative, so 11 surviving colonists and three sidequests nets a health of 14, for example.
Colony leadership
If Shiala survives, leadership is 5
If Ethan Jeong agrees to help the colony, leadership is 12
Colony leadership is not cumulative; if Jeong agrees to help, it doesn't matter what you do with Shiala, you still only get 12 points.
Some people might be too wasted to mingle, though they'll be grateful for the opportunity to make Zhu's Hope great again
For Feros to survive, the total value of colony health + colony leadership must be thirteen or higher. So, for example, if you kill Shiala and Jeong, you need to spare at least 13 colonists, or spare at least 9 colonists and complete all four sidequests. If you convince Jeong to help, you only need to do one sidequest or save one single colonist. Meet this bar and the remaining colonists will thank you for your help and cheer about the colony's newly bright future. Fall short, and they'll dejectedly explain that the colony is being shut down.
With this conversation done, you can talk to the various people left, trade with Ledra (if he survived), give Gavin his data (if you recovered it but delayed turning it in), or simply head straight back to where the Normandy is docked and leave this planet behind. At least one of the unnamed colonists (lying in bed in the Borealis) may refer to your given psych profile while talking to you."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Ilos:_Find_the_Conduit,"This mission is acquired as part of the Race Against Time mission, once the objectives on Therum, Feros, Noveria and Virmire have been completed and after Shepard frees the SSV Normandy from lockdown on the Citadel.","You officially begin this mission by traveling to the Refuge system and landing on Ilos. However, the subsequent cutscenes place you in the moments before entering the Mu Relay.
Normandy[]
Kaidan, Ashley, or Liara will visit Shepard in the Captain's Quarters if a relationship with them was pursued. If not, you immediately cut to the scene of the Normandy approaching the Mu Relay.
Normandy using the Mu Relay
Following the conclusion of your romance, Joker calls Shepard up to the bridge. The Normandy passes through the relay and Ilos comes into view. There are quite a few geth ships in orbit. The scene shifts to the bridge as Joker points out the problem. Whichever squadmate wasn't killed on Virmire stresses that they will be spotted. However, with the stealth systems engaged they can't be seen unless someone looks out a window.
Navigator Pressly is picking up some strange reading from the surface and Shepard orders Joker to drop the squad on top of Saren. According to Pressly, the nearest landing zone is two clicks away -- too far to get to Saren in time. Shepard orders a Mako drop, but Pressly again points out a problem: there are only twenty meters near Saren, and the Mako needs 100 meters for a drop like that.
After an order to find another landing zone, Pressly says that there isn't one. Joker interrupts and asserts he can perform the drop, silencing the protests. Shepard orders the squad into the Mako in preparation for a hard landing. Now all you have to do is select your squad.
Note: Except for the autosave just after the combat drop, there are no checkpoints throughout the entire Ilos segment of the game. Make sure you save your progress often. Legendary Edition:  Autosaves have now been added in certain locations, though manually saving often is still good advice here and everywhere else in the trilogy.
The Plaza[]
Wallpaperable desolation
The scene shifts to Ilos’ surface and Saren walking into a large structure surrounded by geth. However a noise attracts his attention and he sees the Normandy screaming down from the upper atmosphere. Joker is hunched over the controls, and Saren recognizing the danger, yells at the geth to get inside so he can seal the doors. At the last second Joker pulls the Normandy out of the dive as the Mako roars out of the cargo bay, lands, and rolls to stop just outside the doors as they close.
Shepard and the squad exit the Mako and make comments that they aren’t getting through the doors even with the heaviest weapons they have. So find the way that Saren opened them and use it to get to him.
Alien writings on the ruins of Ilos
When you regain control turn around and head back into the ruins. When you start walking for just a few feet you encounter some Geth Troopers so make sure they don’t get to give the warm welcome that they intended. Moving up, you reach an open plaza with little cover. Watch your left and right because there are plenty of geth here. You can actually board the Mako and use its weapons to finish off incoming geth, though it has no room to maneuver and isn't going anywhere else until you get the bunker door open.
Coming up from the stairs to the right are Troopers, Geth Shock Troopers, and Geth Rocket Troopers. To your left are two Geth Armatures. To your front next to the presently locked elevator is a Hardened Crate (hard decryption). Use the limited cover to take out the foot soldiers first before focusing on the walking tanks. The Armatures won't activate until you come within a certain range, so if you stay well back you can finish the other geth before they wake up.
The Armature terminal on the lower ruins
Note:  Before engaging the Armatures, be aware that there is an Armature Control console (hard decryption) on the lower level that can disable the Armatures (at the cost of the experience that killing them would provide, but on higher difficulty levels you may be more interested in survival than experience by this point). If you wish to pursue this method of progress, head directly to the right and down the stairs. The plaza forms a loop with the ruins below, so if you follow this route you'll eventually emerge behind the Armatures.
If you choose to fight the Armatures, there is more cover available when dealing with them so use it and only step out to shoot or use powers. Keep your squadmates in cover as well. By now, at least if you're not playing on Insanity level, you may well survive a direct hit, but don't tempt fate. Use Overload, Warp, Throw, and any other powers to keep them off balance and from shooting back.
Towards the wall with the white light from either the lower ruins (left) or the open area you came in (right)
If you head down to the lower ruins using the right route (or west if consulting your map) you may encounter a geth or two that didn't come up to the previous battle so take them out. When you reach the bottom, there is a large room off to your left that has some pesky Geth Sappers and Geth Stalkers in it. You can use Lift or Throw if you have them to get the Hoppers to calm down a bit so you can better aim at them. There is a Locked Crate (easy decryption) in the corner once you've dealt with the irritations.
Proceed then to the trench labeled in your map. In it is the aforementioned Armature Control station for disabling the Armatures upstairs. You can still hack the console for some experience points even if you already killed the Armatures.
Once you cleared both lower and upper ruins (or not and you're in a hurry), proceed south of the plaza and follow the route that leads into the courtyard. You can't miss this route, there's a lootable crate here that doesn't need decrypting as well as rows of the tentaclebearded sculptures on both sides. Eventually you'll trigger an autosave then come across a corner where you can proceed forward or follow the path to the left. This gives you a good sniping point on the enemies below in the courtyard, however if you go too far then you will drop into the courtyard where there is little cover.
The Courtyard[]
A contrast of dark and rust
No matter your choices it is better to snipe first because it can take down the Geth Destroyer and its escorting Shock Troopers before they can overwhelm you. Well at least then you can fight them from cover as they come up and around from the path. If you have the AI Hacking skill to at least Advanced (the middle) skill level, then use it on the Destroyer because it makes short work of the Shock Troopers. Also even if they escape and attack, then you have cover in order to deal with them. When you're ready to take out the Destroyer you can Lift it to make it easy to shoot and keeping it from attacking you at the same time. When they have been dealt with head down the path, DO NOT drop down into the courtyard.
As you round the corner at the end of the path there are two more Shock Troopers on an elevated platform. There is little cover here, but these aren't tough enemies at this point in your career. When they are down head into the courtyard and head left into an elevator that takes you up to where the Shock Troopers were. Note:  You cannot drop down from the upper platform, you have to take the elevator down again. As the place is indefensible wherein you're essentially on a coverless shooting gallery, DO NOT explore this area until you've eliminated all threats or you're confident you can take on the challenge.
Ragnarok-proofing at its finest means working elevators 50,000 years later
In the mess of pillars that lies to the south of the courtyard is an active elevator, one that your map indicates goes a long way. It is defended by five Geth Sappers. Use the cover to shoot them full of holes however there are places where they can shoot you that you can’t shoot back. If your squad is reasonably tough send it forward and they will be able to shorten things for you. The key here is to stay in cover and have patience when taking out these attackers; again the Lift ability can calm them down and make them easy to aim at.
The only lootables in the vicinity are two Secure Crates (average decryption), one along the wall where the Destroyer and Shock Troopers were, and one on the elevatored platform where the Shock Troopers were. Proceed to the long elevator when you're done with the area. Note:  While this is a point of no return in that the elevator will be disabled once you go down, there's no need to backtrack now for anything missed since you'll be emerging at the plaza later anyway.
Security Station[]
The Security Station
While the elevator chugs along, one of your squadmates comments that the place must have its own power because the elevator is still working. When you reach the bottom, approach with caution because this can be a difficult battle especially on higher levels. An autosave is generated after you step out of the elevator.
When you reach the area labeled Armature Bay on your map, note that there are four ""Armature Control"" panels (hard decryption), and if you have sufficient ability you can use them to activate Armatures which are of great value in distracting and destroying their fellow geth. You will get full experience for any geth the Armatures kill.
Inside the large room are a Geth Prime, Geth Juggernauts or Destroyers (difficulty dependent), Troopers, Rocket Troopers, and Shock Troopers.  Trying to go past this force in order to activate the four Geth Armatures right away can prove problematic, but even on Insanity level it is fairly simple to quickly hack the one at near on the left/right and then retreat rapidly down the hallway you entered from - be sure to disable the Geth Prime (Sabotage works well) as well as activate defensive abilities if available, such as Barrier or Immunity. Once you get a single Armature active, it often proves quite distracting to the geth, allowing you breathing space to get a second Armature online, and so forth. Done right, you'll barely have to shoot.
There are ramps on either side of the security room which you can dart up to get to an upper platform that gives you a lot of cover and a great firing position. Retreating back down the entry hall towards the elevator is also viable, as it tends to result in the smaller geth moving out ahead of the larger ones making them easier to thin out.
""...Cannot be stopped""
When the geth are down, head up the T-shaped ramp at the back of the room, and you will reach the security console. Activating it will disable the lock on the archive door, as well as display a badly distorted holographic recording. While concerned about it, your squadmates don't understand the message. On the other hand the words that remain on the recording are clear to Shepard, and the squadmates discern that the Cipher must have transferred knowledge of the Prothean language. The communication is basically a warning about the Reapers and Shepard explains to the squad that it must have came too late. The communication then changes to a more serious tone, however it becomes completely scrambled and untranslatable.
There is only one lootable in the area: a Hardened Crate (hard decryption), in the alcove east of the security room going by the map.
Head back down the stairs and up the other elevator. Note:  This is a point of no return, as the access points are sealed shut at both ends. You end up back at the plaza: loot the crate there if you haven't already, sweep the area if you missed anything, head back to the Mako, and drive. As you approach the Mako one of your squadmates wants a vote on taking the vehicle into the creepy underground bunker. The other thinks it's a good idea, as the firepower will come in handy. Another autosave is generated as you enter the tunnel.
Note: Technically you can walk the entire length of the very long path, but it is time-consuming and inevitably you'll require the Mako anyway to end the mission.
The Archives[]
Who votes we take the vehicle into the creepy, underground bunker?
When you reach the archives travel down and keep going because there are no enemies that are in your immediate vicinity. There are no item pickups either. While you drive along the linear path, your squadmates chat: one will comment that they expected Saren to lay a trap, as it is the perfect place for an ambush; and another will comment about the things on the walls, to which the other responds that they are probably stasis pods intended for Protheans' survival.
About halfway through the corridor you will reach the next ramp down. Slightly afterwards will you encounter the first sign of enemy presence in the bunker, some of Saren’s rear guard, namely 3-4 Geth Rocket Troopers. They pose no real threat, so when you get close just jump out and shoot them on foot for an increased experience reward. When the geth are destroyed, keep heading down the ramps. When you reach the next landing, you'll see a shimmering at the far end, and a twist from the generic Mako run.
That shimmering is a forcefield. When you get close, an autosave is generated. The Mako becomes trapped by another forcefield that comes up behind the vehicle. Don’t try to shoot your way out because you can’t. One of your squadmates will comment about it being a trap, however the other will counter that it probably isn't Saren or the geth. Exit the Mako and head into the elevator that is along the right wall.
The Watcher[]
Take the only door out - to the right
After you enter the elevator and as you descend, your squadmates comment about the situation and how that someone is working here, but probably not with the geth. When the elevator stops, walk across the platform and select the hologram.
It comments that while you aren’t Prothean or machine, you were ""expected"". It talks about the warnings from the beacons. One of your squadmates will comment that it is a badly damaged VI. The program counters that it doesn’t sense the taint of indoctrination upon any of the squad, unlike the other, Saren, who also passed recently, so there is still hope. The other squadmate will ask why they can understand it even though it is Prothean. The hologram says that it was monitoring communications and translated its output so it could communicate. It introduces itself as Vigil and comments that while you are currently safe, nowhere will be for long.
The Watcher's Chamber
You can ask questions and get a lot of valuable information from Vigil so it’s worth staying. Asking the first question about who it is it will provide a background to its creation and having inputs from Ksad Ishan the chief researcher at the Ilos facility. When you ask why it stopped the Mako, Vigil will say that the cycle must be broken, as it has gone on for millions of years. Vigil however needs the squad to understand so they can avoid making the same mistakes. It tells how the Citadel is really an enormous Mass Relay and a huge trap. When the relay is activated the Reapers come through from Dark Space and destroy all organic civilization in the galaxy before disappearing again. If you investigate then you will get some guesses on why the Reapers operate the way they do however no one knows why.
After responding, Vigil will confirm the fears about the Citadel Fleet and the Council and that is what happened with the Protheans. Their leaders were dead before anyone knew what was happening. Because the Reapers had access to all the maps and census data on the Protheans, they went systematically and wiped out their civilization. Colonies were isolated and picked off one by one and indoctrinated “refugees” were taken in by other Protheans only to have them turn on their own people when the Reapers showed up.
Sacrificing the many for the few so that everyone can be saved in the future
Respond to Vigil and it will explain about how the Conduit is a prototype mass relay and that it links to the Citadel, bypassing defenses. The Protheans were on the verge of unlocking the technology when the Reapers invaded. When you ask, Vigil will give the story behind how Ilos survived because all records of the project were destroyed in the initial attack so the Reapers had no knowledge of the planet. They went into cryostasis and eventually the facility went dark. However as the power failed, Vigil eventually had to deactivate the pods and even when the Reapers finally retreated, only the top researchers were still alive, all twelve of them. You can comment about that, but Vigil defends its actions.
Further investigation reveals the scientists knew their race was doomed however they labored for years to stop the cycle. They found a way to alter the signals from the Citadel to the keepers to prevent them from activating the relay. They used the Conduit to travel to the Citadel and thus preventing Sovereign from signaling the keepers. Vigil, if asked describes that their fate, trapped on the station, probably wasn’t pleasant.
Before you leave, Vigil gives you a file that temporarily will give full access to the Citadel and its resources. However you must find the Master Control Terminal to get that access. Vigil says to follow Saren as he knows where to go. As you leave, if Liara is in your party she will ask to stay because they will probably never have another chance like this. You can either stay and ask Vigil more questions or you can go; she will understand either way. When you do leave, Vigil gives you one last beacon of hope: Saren hasn’t reached the conduit yet and therefore Shepard still has time. This is a good time to save if you haven't recently: the last auto save will bring you back to the beginning, though in Legendary Edition an autosave is automatically generated here.
When this mission is marked complete, the Race Against Time: Sovereign entry updates to Race Against Time: Conduit."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Noveria:_Geth_Interest,"Prerequisite: Citadel: Expose Saren
This mission is acquired after Shepard is given Spectre status and reports to Dock 422. Udina will say that Anderson is stepping down as the commanding officer of the SSV Normandy and that the ship is now commanded by Shepard. If you ask, Anderson will say that Noveria is trouble and always has been. Anderson warns that Spectres are the only Council agents Noveria will respect; he tells Shepard to take care when going there.
Go to Noveria in the Pax system, of the Horse Head Nebula cluster. Noveria is a private world outside of Citadel Space. Only Spectre authority allows your visit, and even then it will not be well tolerated by the businesses and other ""interests"".","The Normandy landing on Noveria
When approaching Noveria, apparently you are not on the scheduled arrival list. Noveria's traffic controller warns that the ship is being tracked by defense systems. Joker invokes Citadel business and states he has a Council Spectre aboard. The controller clears the party for landing, but warns that identity confirmation will be done on arrival, on penalty of impounding the ship if confirmation cannot be established.
When you leave the Normandy head around the hangar. You will run into Captain Maeko Matsuo, Sergeant Kaira Stirling, and a turian who block access into Port Hanshan. You can ask who they are and declare who you're working for (or not). If you say you're with the Alliance, Matsuo remarks you're a long way from home, and some of your squadmates have a quip for that.
Rent-a-cops versus budding badasses
Regardless of what you tell them they react with suspicion on your presence. Matsuo signals Stirling to take your weapons, citing a strict policy against carrying firearms in Port Hanshan. Before Stirling does, your team pull out your guns and point them at the other party, with one of your squadmembers having something to say on the matter.
At this point you can choose to cooperate and deescalate tensions, or refuse to hand over your guns; in the former case, again some of your squadmates have something to say about that. Two of the three decisions yield +2 morality points in either direction.
Whichever you decide, Gianna Parasini interrupts via intercom and tells Matsuo to stand down. Shepard's Spectre identity has been confirmed, and with it the privilege to carry guns, and Matsuo is compelled to allow the Commander to enter the port.
Should've been common courtesy to switch off the alarms when you've been manually cleared to go in
When you reach the second landing and pass through some scanners, an alarm goes off. Parasini is there and tells you not to worry, since they are only weapons detectors. The sequence is inescapable; you'll have to talk to Parasini for the lay of the land (Note:  It's actually possible to talk to Parasini and not set off the alarms by standing at a small area below the nearest detector: her conversation interaction range extends up to there). She finally introduces herself as the administrative assistant to Administrator Anoleis, the chief of the port. If you wonder about the heavily-armed nature of the place, Parasini explains it's for protecting the interests and privacy of Noveria's corporations, and you can offer your opinion on that.
To get things going, you have to ask about any unusual visitors. Parasini admits that Matriarch Benezia arrived recently and headed to Peak 15, but explains that Anoleis must approve any request to leave Port Hanshan if you want to follow. If you don't have Liara in your current party but she has joined your crew, one of your squadmates will recommend that you take her with you because of her familial relationship with Benezia. Otherwise, Liara herself figures you may want to talk about her mother, which raises the issue of whether Liara can be trusted to side with the team over her mother if it comes to it.
If you don't trust Liara, you can tell her to go back to the ship, and you'll gain an option to change squadmates on the spot. Otherwise, the conversation concludes normally. Whichever the result, proceed to the elevator to the plaza down some stairs after customs, or alternatively backtrack for a while to speak with Matsuo, which again can yield up to +2 Paragon or Renegade points.
Your journal now renames this mission to Noveria: Leave Port Hanshan and adds the mission Noveria: Matriarch Benezia.
Port Hanshan[]
On stepping out of the elevator, you now have free access to most areas in Port Hanshan. The only places off-limits to you at the moment are the garage, the Synthetic Insights offices, and Anoleis' office.
All work and no play makes for a cantankerous salarian administrator
To talk with Anoleis, simply request Gianna to unlock his office for you. On the far side of the main area you'll find the garage entrance, but you'll need a garage pass. If you attempt to leave without one, you will be stopped by an ERCS guard. Lilihierax, the turian near the garage entrance, can provide information about Noveria (and the earliest opportunity for acquiring the Noveria: Peak 15 mission) but will not give up his garage pass.
If you want to buy or sell equipment, the hanar Opold is the merchant to go to. It will even give you the Noveria: Smuggling assignment if you want it. Other interactions are available at the Port Hanshan Mezzanine, and you may get the chance to participate in Noveria: Espionage if you so choose. There's also a hackable terminal at the office-like space on the upper level of the mezzanine, and it yields the assignment Doctor at Risk. You can also disable the security to the SI office from the same room: this will come in handy if you choose to take up an offer from Lorik Qui'in downstairs.
Getting a Garage Pass[]
Now, your only real concern at the moment is on getting a garage pass so you can resume your pursuit of Matriarch Benezia. The other interactions are there for additional credits/experience/morality points/story development, but strictly not necessary. Proceed in whichever way you see fit.
Numerous ways to gain access to the garage, none of which involves simply killing a rent-a-cop
The shortest method of obtaining a garage pass is by ratting out Opold. When you obtain the hanar's package in Noveria: Smuggling, present the evidence to Anoleis. He rewards you with credits and a pass.
The second method requires some verbal maneuvering and even some combat. ""The greater the risk, the greater the reward"" holds true here. Accept the mission Noveria: Lorik Qui'in.
Whichever way you obtain a garage pass, proceed to Noveria: Matriarch Benezia for the rest of the Noveria story arc."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Prologue:_Find_the_Beacon,This mission is acquired after the opening sequence and reporting to the comm room aboard the SSV Normandy.,"Normandy Pre-Mission[]
Take some time to socialize with the crew
The scene opens with the SSV Normandy flying through the Sol system as Joker calls out to the rest of the ship to prepare for an FTL jump through the Arcturus Prime relay. Commander Shepard proceeds through the CIC, occasionally maneuvering around crew members on the way to the bridge.
As Shepard reaches the bridge and looks out the window, the Normandy hits the relay and jumps. Joker proceeds to run a system check and the turian overlooking them throws an approving comment before leaving. Joker comments that he hates the turian; Kaidan Alenko asks why, seeing as the resident turian Spectre Nihlus just gave him a compliment, but Joker argues that Spectres are always trouble and that he dislikes having one on board. You can choose to either reply positively or tell them to stop arguing. When Captain Anderson comes over the comm asking for an update, Joker replies that they've cleared the relay and that Nihlus is coming his way. Anderson replies that he has already arrived and asks Joker to pass along to Shepard to meet him in the comm room. After replying, you get control of Shepard and may explore the bridge and CIC. On your way to the comm room, you can talk to Navigator Pressly at his station, as well as Corporal Richard Jenkins and Doctor Chakwas outside the comm room. Pick the investigate options at the left of the dialogue wheel to obtain some Codex entries.
It's straight on down to Eden Prime once you start this meeting
When you enter the comm room, Nihlus says that he was hoping Shepard would arrive first, as it would give them a chance to talk. Respond to that, and Nihlus will comment about Eden Prime, vaguely asking how safe it really is. Soon Anderson walks in and says to Nihlus they should tell the Commander what is really going on. Nihlus agrees and fills in that the mission is ""far more than a simple shakedown run.""
Anderson explains that a science team on Eden Prime discovered a Prothean beacon; since the beacon might contain technologically significant information, it needs to be secured and brought to the Citadel for study. For the Protheans Codex entry, be sure to ask about them. It is revealed that Nihlus is also there to evaluate Shepard's performance in terms of the Commander's Spectre potential.
The conversation with Nihlus and Captain Anderson is interrupted when Joker reports a problem over the comm. A view screen opens up and shows a transmission from some marines on Eden Prime. Some heavy fighting as well as disconcerting footage of an immense alien-looking ship is shown before the transmission is cut – Anderson concludes that ""this mission just got a lot more complicated"", and orders Shepard to get ready.
When you arrive at Eden Prime, Joker flies the Normandy over the landscape, while Anderson gives a final briefing. Shepard and squad's objective is to head straight for the dig site and secure it. Nihlus gets out first to scout out ahead, and you are dropped off at another drop point.
Eden Prime Surface[]
No one even says killing them is ""extreme.""
""Ship perimeter secure, Commander!"", Kaidan opens as you turn around and head towards the dig site. Nihlus comes over the comm to tell you to keep your guard up as the colony got hit hard. Head right by the stretch of grass with the gas bags as there is an easy-to-miss crate in the corner which contains an upgrade and gives you the Upgrades Codex entry. If you haven't done so already, take a moment to open up the menu and look over your team's abilities and equipment. Before assigning any points in abilities, you may want to save your game as those allocations are permanent  once made (for more information see the Talents page). Also note that whatever you equip Jenkins with will be lost in the next few moments.
Once you have it, head back to the left and you will eventually trigger a cutscene where Shepard and the squad are approaching a field. Shepard raises a fist to tell them to halt, then signals Jenkins to move up. However, as Jenkins advances, several Geth Recon Drones fly up and kill him. Once you regain control, take cover and eliminate the hostiles; you can destroy them easily with your pistol.
Gone too soon.
Once they are down, you can investigate Jenkins' body and you can earn a few morality points based on your response.
Head up the field and after a few seconds, more Recon Drones will come flying out. Take cover again and destroy them. Once they are down, move up. Note: after dealing with this first wave of drones, Kaidan will lose a large portion of his health. This appears to be a scripted event and is not due to actual damage inflicted by enemies.
Nihlus comes over the comm with some not-so-inviting news, as if you needed to hear more. Apparently, he has come across a lot of dead bodies. When you reach the top of the hill, head to the left first to grab a medical kit and then use the large flat trees upcoming because there will be three more Geth Recon Drones to take down. Use cover, gunfire, and powers to take out the drones. Once they are down, head up and when you reach a clearing, you will enter another cutscene.
Prothean Dig Site[]
The last of the 212
The cutscene shows a soldier, one of those seen earlier in the transmission, running and being pursued by two drones. She takes a hit but her shields hold; then she falls, pulls out her pistol and destroys her two pursuers. Then she takes notice of two Geth Troopers, and a colonist who is impaled upon a spike. The geth spot her and she runs for cover and pulls out her assault rifle.
You regain control at this stage—once the geth attackers are down, approach the soldier and talk to her.
Note:  If you held off from investigating Jenkins' corpse earlier, the last opportunity to do it will be before talking to the rescued soldier. Afterward, Jenkins' body can no longer be interacted with.
She introduces herself as Gunnery Chief Ashley Williams of the 212. The conversation can go any way you want, but take it easy if Shepard is male and you want to pursue a relationship with Ashley later. She tells you that the dig site is a little further up the road, and the three of you move out together.
Squad: Up to this point, you may have noticed that Kaidan was ""unkillable"" by enemies. After Ashley joins your team this is no longer the case, and either member of your squad can be downed by enemy fire. You'll need to take care of them in combat by ordering them to use cover or retreat, or by using First Aid to heal them up if their health becomes severely damaged. Downed squadmates can be revived during combat by a few abilities but if you're playing a new, low-level character you may not have access to them yet. They will revive automatically at a low level of health once all enemies in the area have been eliminated and sometimes if you retreat a very long distance away. For more information see the Combat page.
Before you leave, grab the crate and upgrade kit to the right. The crate contains the Scorpion light armor, which has better stats than the default Onyx armor and is thus probably worth equipping on someone. The upgrade kit contains some random loot. Once you have everything, head out and be prepared.
The Prothean dig site, minus the artifact you landed on the planet for
Once you get to a series of rocks, take cover because there will be more geth that attack from the dig site itself. Use the cover and your squadmates to eliminate them. One geth will be on the exterior patrolling, so watch out as it will come from an angle that is not easy to see or hit.
Once they are all down, investigate the dig site. If you try to move past the dig site without investigating it, the next scene below plays anyway.
A dialogue scene will show and Ashley is astonished that the beacon is no longer in the site; it has apparently been moved. Before you leave, grab the crate next to one of the exterior pillars of the site for a few weapons as well as the Body Armor Codex entry. Also at this point, Nihlus comes over the comm saying that there is a change of plans: he will be investigating a small spaceport and will wait for you there.
""Dragon's teeth""
Head up the ramps to the science camp. When you get close, Kaidan points out that it's a good place for an ambush and instructs you to keep your guard up. A cutscene will then show the spikes from earlier and some cybernetic creatures on them. Suddenly, one spike lowers and Ashley wonders what the geth did to them. Kill the Husk and its two friends: be careful not to let them get too close because they have a devastating electrical attack and will proceed to melee you and the squad to death if given a chance. Tip: Backing up while firing is a good basic tactic, as is using abilities like Kaidan's Throw to knock them down.
Once the Husks are down, don't leave before grabbing the upgrade kit behind the spikes, which are called dragon's teeth. There are also some crates in one of the shacks, the one with the window open. Grab the two crates inside the shack and head for the other.
""... the only sane one left.""
There is a lock on this shack which you must bypass. If you fail, you must break down equipment into omni-gel to get enough of it to bypass the lock. You will get the same amount of experience either way. Once inside, there are two scientists: Dr. Warren, who is the one in charge, and her assistant Manuel, who seems to be a little off his rocker. You can ask them both questions about the attack and where the beacon went; it was apparently moved to the starport that morning. You can continue asking questions – if you are annoyed with Manuel or you want nine Renegade points, you can knock him out. Once you are finished, head over to the path and you are treated with a cutscene.
Eden Prime Starport[]
The cutscene shows Nihlus approaching the spaceport. He takes cover and then leans out and sees another turian, Saren Arterius. Nihlus questions Saren, then turns his back. Nihlus was not expecting the geth, but Saren claims to have it under control. However, the pistol that Saren pulls on Nihlus hints at some other motives. When the cutscene ends, you hear a gunshot that reverberates in the air. Round the corner and head down the path. Off in the distance you see a massive ship taking off.
The exterior of the spaceport has a few Husks, and some Geth Troopers are defending this position. The Husks will rush you while the Troopers will stay at a distance. At the top of the stairs is another containment cell; if you hit it at the right time you can eliminate the Troopers before they are a threat. Once they are down, destroy the Husks that are preparing to swarm you. Use Kaidan's Throw to help with the overwhelming part, and otherwise keep backing up while firing at the Husks. Once they're down, head to the left and access a malfunctioning object for some loot. There is also a crate outside another shack. Bypass the lock to meet some farmers, though you may wish to make a quick save before doing so just in case the ensuing conversation doesn't go the way you'd like.
Cole and his coworkers
A farmer named Cole and two of his friends exit saying they are not armed. You can ask Cole some questions about the attack and the ship you just saw. Before you leave, one of the other farmers asks Cole to give you some loot. Apparently, there was a smuggling ring and the farmers were making some illicit cash by hiding stolen goods in their sheds. Respond to that any way you wish. If you have at least one point in Charm or Intimidate, you can use a persuasion dialogue option on the left (blue for Paragon or red for Renegade) to pry some more information out of Cole; apparently, he had a contact at the spaceport who was also a member of the smuggling operation.
Ashley demands the name of the contact, but Cole demurs, not wanting to get him into trouble. If you have at least two points in Charm or Intimidate, this gives you the option to threaten or cajole the name out of Cole. Along with the name (""Powell""), using the persuasion options also rewards you with some morality points. After your conversation ends, you will be awarded the pistol Cole said he found, regardless of any other outcomes of your talk with him. Note that this pistol, a Stinger II model from Devlon Industries, is an above-average weapon compared to anything else you might find this early in the game, if this is your first time playing with your current character.
Note:  Even though you can talk with Cole again once your initial conversation is over, you'll only be able to use the ""investigate"" options to ask about the geth attack, the Prothean beacon, and the hostile ship. If you didn't or couldn't use the persuasion dialogue choices discussed above, you won't get another chance.
Once you are done talking with the farmers, head into the shack for a storage locker. This locker requires Electronics to unlock; even a single point in Kaidan's or Shepard's Electronics talent (if you have it) is enough to bypass the locker. If you don't have the score now, you will probably level up once more before moving on to the next area, so you can come back for the locker later.
Also gone too soon.
Head up to the platform where you can see a body; unfortunately, it is Nihlus. Before you investigate his body, head to a fire in the corner because it isolates an upgrade kit in it. Going into the fire can kill you very quickly, but it's possible to grab the upgrade kit without doing so. Once you have it, there is a medical kit on the ground near the steps, so grab it if you need it. Then investigate Nihlus' body.
Ashley immediately notices someone moving behind the crates. Everyone pulls their pistols, but it is just a dockworker. He introduces himself as Powell, a name you'll recognize if you got Cole to reveal it earlier. You can ask him the same questions as you did the farmers, though he will give slightly different answers. If you managed to persuade Cole to mention Powell's name, you will have the option to ask Powell about the smuggling ring, at which point he will say that it doesn't matter anymore. Press him and he will say that no one misses a few pieces from the military orders. Ashley presses him for the grenades and he hands them over. You can use Paragon or Renegade dialogue options to get a High Explosive grenade upgrade out of him (requires 3 Charm or Intimidate, respectively, though only the Renegade dialogue choice rewards you with morality points).
The next area is relatively simple, mainly because it is very linear. Head past where you talked to Powell and send your squadmates first because there are two Geth Troopers around the corner. Once they fall head down the catwalk and look onto the train below. There are some geth there and an explosive crate; shoot the crate to take them out without having to go down the ramps. Even with a shotgun, it is easy to do so. Once they are treated to their daily helping of explosives, head down the ramps and onto the train.
No organics allowed
Take cover here because further down are some Geth Troopers, Geth Shock Troopers, and a Geth Destroyer. The Destroyer will, once you or the squad open fire, start walking towards you. Eventually, it will charge at you and the squad and either melee or use its shotgun to kill you. Hitting it with an ability like Throw can help keep it at a safe distance for longer. Take the Destroyer out first, then move from cover to cover to take out the geth further along. A character trained with sniper rifles can take them out easily without having to move from one position to another. When the geth finally fall, move up, and grab some medi-gel from a medical kit about half of the way down the train. Note: if you couldn't unlock the storage locker before, now is the last time you can go back for it. Otherwise, activate the train controls.
Spaceport Platform Two[]
Once you activate the train controls, you are treated to a cutscene where the train moves along the tracks. Then the scene jumps to the other platform where Saren is with some geth, giving orders to erase their tracks by destroying the entire colony. Then it shows Saren standing in front of the beacon and being lifted into the air. The scene cuts to a Geth Shock Trooper standing up after setting a charge to see Shepard's train arriving.
Let your squadmates do the killing while you defuse the bombs
When you regain control of Shepard, you have five minutes to disarm four explosives. The first is right near the train and can be done without shooting. Be warned that while you are disarming them, you can't return fire or do anything else, so make sure you are in cover and the enemies are pinned down. Once the first charge is disarmed, head up the ramps and you will come under fire. Head across the bridge and use the last panel on the right to position your squad to cover you while you move to the left and disarm another charge. Then take out the Geth Troopers, Geth Sniper, and Shock Troopers that are attacking you. Be careful of the Sniper because it can take you down in one hit, even with full shields. The geth sometimes hide behind the crates at the other end of the platform and on the bridge, but they rarely go to the other side so no need to worry about flanking fire.
Once all the geth are down, the first alcove on the left has another charge; disarm it and then head all the way down the platform and disarm the last charge. Now head over to the ramps to the last area of the level. There is a crate just before the catwalk, grab it then move your squadmates about halfway down the catwalk and prepare to face the final four enemies of the level: two Husks and two Geth Troopers. The Husks will storm up the ramp so use Throw to get them back down the ramps. There is a possibility that one or both can go over the railings to the left, though once they're at the bottom of ramps it is easy to take them out because they won't move. Once the Husks are out of the way, move to eliminate the Troopers.
The beacon and the mystery starship's crater
Once the troopers are down, DO NOT investigate the beacon yet if you aren't ready to end the mission. There is a crate and a storage locker on the main platform, a wall safe to the far left, and a technician kit on the far right, when looking at the beacon. Note that there is a brief but easy-to-miss cutscene where your team observes the burning crater where the hostile ship landed; this triggers if you walk up to the middle of the fence posts behind the beacon and next to the crate (i.e. in between the beacon and the crate). Once you are ready, investigate the beacon and a final cutscene will start.
Shepard radios the Normandy for pickup while Kaidan and Ashley investigate the beacon. The person who is the same gender as Shepard will then go to talk to the Commander, while the other investigates the beacon. Without warning, the beacon activates and starts pulling the nearby squad member towards it; Shepard notices, runs up and grabs them, throwing them bodily to one side. Shepard is  lifted up by the beacon instead, and a scene showing disjointed chaotic images plays, while the third squad member prevents the one Shepard saved from going back to help the Commander. Finally, the beacon explodes and Shepard falls to the deck, unconscious.
The scene switches to the massive enemy ship gliding through space. Inside its dark metallic interior, Saren sits alone at a command chair. Then, a tall asari dressed in black approaches and coughs lightly to announce her presence. She informs the turian that the attempt to destroy the Eden Prime colony was foiled by a team from an Alliance warship under the command of Captain Anderson. Saren asks her about the Prothean beacon, and the asari admits that one of the humans may have used it. The interior of the ship begins flashing red, and Saren flies into an uncontrollable rage. The scene ends as he growls at the asari that the human must be eliminated."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Noveria:_Reactor_Repair,"Prerequisite: Noveria: Peak 15
The mission is acquired upon reactivation of the Mira VI. It is one of two tasks you need to do before progressing further.","Head to the elevator leading to the reactor, the one on the left as you approach from the VI core and the landlines.
Once you reach the main reactor, enter the first room and unless you have top-of-the-line Combat Scanners, your radar will be jammed. That's a sure sign it's time to re-equip your anti-armor rounds and other stuff you prefer against geth enemies.
This first room contains a technician kit and a disposal canister for lootables, as well as the area's Mira terminal that you can access later. There are two doors forward, each leading to a walkway that meets in the middle to the reactor interface. Three Geth Destroyers and five Geth Stalkers are in the core and will charge the moment they see you. Meanwhile a Geth Juggernaut waits on a balcony upstairs to rain down rocket fire.
The geth are being generous with their troop deployments
The door to the left leads to the walkway with stairs that allow access to the upper level. Two of the three Destroyers are here, and four of the five Stalkers spawn along this side (the fifth is in the middle gangway). The walkway to the right leads to a single Destroyer, though overhead is the Juggernaut whose rockets can kill you if you aren't paying attention. Pick whichever path is convenient for you. Note:  there are Fusion Containment Cells near each Destroyer and Juggernaut's starting positions. You may be able to take off a chunk of their health and shields if you're quick and have a good aim.
If you get overwhelmed you can retreat to the antechamber because the doors will not open for the geth--even if they are at the doors--so use the room as a fall back point if necessary. If you choose to rush to the mission objective, going right might be more expedient, though you'll still have to face the synthetics that will be bearing down on your position one way or another.
If your radar is still jammed or you still see an enemy on your map then you have missed one of the many Geth Stalkers flitting about. If you have Lift and Throw you can actually throw the geth off the platform and into the core. Otherwise just shoot them until they keel over. Warning:  Liberal use of biotics may result in the Stalkers getting stuck in undesirable places, such as the crawl space beneath the catwalks as these have few (if any) firing solutions.
The lootables in the area are generally worth the effort
Aside from the entrance antechamber, the other lootables in the area are on the upper level, named Reactor Observation Deck if you choose to save there. There is a weapons locker near the Juggernaut's hangout, as well as a storage locker next to a computer terminal, all rated easy decryption. The assignment UNC: Major Kyle can be acquired from said terminal if it hasn't been gotten yet from any other sources (easy decryption).
When you're done reconnecting the helium-3 fuel lines, take the elevator back up to the Mira Core."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Noveria:_Lorik_Qui%27in,"Prerequisite: Noveria: Geth Interest
If you haven't obtained a garage pass yet on your first conversation with Administrator Anoleis, Gianna Parasini whispers this mission to you on your way out of the office.
Otherwise, you can still obtain the mission from the turian himself on the Mezzanine.
Note: If after acquiring the mission from Gianna you obtained a garage pass by presenting Opold's package, and you did so before talking to Lorik Qui'in and receiving his assignment, you will be unable to complete this mission, and the respective entry will remain incomplete in your journal. However, receiving the assignment from Lorik Qui'in and then leaving Port Hanshan with the help of Opold's package will allow you to complete this mission any time later, although you will have fewer potential options if you choose to bargain with Anoleis (see below).","Lorik Qui'in has a proposition that will benefit you both. He explains that Anoleis is proving to be a corrupt administrator. As the administrator of one of the port's tenants, Lorik does have a garage pass to offer you, but in return he needs access to the evidence against Anoleis that Lorik has hidden at the Synthetic Insights office. You can consider this offer, or opt for another solution.
If you want Lorik's pass and agree to help him, he will give you access to the Synthetic Insights office, which is being guarded by some of the ERCS contingent. As you leave, Lorik asks you to keep bloodstains off the carpets.
Raiding Synthetic Insights[]
Kill them or scare them? Player choice!
Head back down the mezzanine elevator and to the route that leads to the garage. There is an elevator just before the stairs to the Garage; step inside to reach Synthetic Insights office. The corridor before the main room is a good save point. When you get close to the door you can either convince the two ERCS Guards there to stand down or just shoot them. Talking to them earns morality points and they go away. Attacking them yields experience points.
Note:  Using Charm/Intimidate to get rid of the extra guards also removes the Assault Drone you might otherwise encounter if you didn't hack the Synthetic Insights Security terminal. Also, the drone only activates if the first female human guard you encounter is able to set off the security alarm, so killing her before she can will prevent the drone from appearing.
Once the first two guards are dealt with, the place goes on lockdown and can only be reopened by Kaira Stirling's authorization, so you can't go back until the files are found.
The area has a lot of loot, though kill the hostiles first as you'll have ample time to ransack the place afterward. The SI office layout is roughly similar to the mezzanine's, only with two half walls in the lower level instead of a rock sculpture. The guards on the lower level are easy to deal with, and there are a few more guards on the upper level, including a sniper who doesn't like to come down. There are a couple of shootable Fire Containment Systems on the floor, which deal poison damage to nearby guards.
Once the guards are all dead start the item sweep from the lower level: west from where you came in, a locked crate (easy Decryption) next to a chamber entrance. Inside the chamber, a weapon locker (easy Decryption). On the part of your map labeled Lorik's Office (which is actually upstairs), a computer console (easy Decryption) and an upgrade kit.
Upstairs near the stairs there are three doors to the north. All of them are inaccessible except for the leftmost one (easy Decryption) (Legendary Edition:  The inaccessible doors have no lighting compared to the original version, making the leftmost door stand out more). Beyond this door is a technician kit, a medical kit, and a wall safe (easy Decryption). The actual office of Lorik Qui'in has a medical kit, a secure wall safe (average Decryption), and his personal computer which contains the evidence. When you are ready insert the OSD Lorik provided then leave.
Stirling and her sniper pals would like to have a word with you
On your way out, you'll bump into Kaira Stirling, accompanied by more ERCS Guards. Stirling is a cop on the take, and the evidence Lorik is after will implicate her should it be revealed. Stirling refers to Shepard as a cop-killer, and you have to neutralize her all the same.
Stirling and her friends tend to stand where they are for a few seconds while pulling their guns out, presenting an opportunity to fire on the clumped group without retaliation for a moment. If High Explosive Rounds are used, specifically on a sniper rifle, it becomes entirely possible to eliminate Kaira and her two buddies instantly by simply pulling it out and firing in their general direction. A grenade or Singularity will provide similar results.
The people Kaira brought with her are an immediate threat in the melee, along with Stirling herself, a potent biotic. Another member of her squad is also a biotic who prefers pushing people. Get rid of Stirling first because she is the hardest target, but don't neglect the others because they will take you and your squadmates quickly as well -- the humans with sniper rifles and turians with shotguns are both quite dangerous.
There isn't a lot of cover so use the little you have to your advantage. Once Stirling's group on the top are eliminated, take care of the two on the lower level. They can be taken out from the upper level, or they will soon come upstairs on their own.
Once the place has died down, do a quick sweep of the complex for any crates you may have missed and head out of the office.
Multiple Choice[]
Neutral Evil, Lawful Good, and True Neutral: play them off each other, or be played in turn
When you reach the main level again, you run into Gianna, who is curious about the ruckus in the Synthetic Insights offices. Respond whichever way you want. Gianna asks to speak with you at the hotel bar before you try to talk to Qui'in. Follow her advice for additional intrigue and gameplay rewards. If you're aiming for expediency regardless of missed opportunities just give the evidence to Qui'in, or alternatively, betray the turian by giving the evidence to Anoleis for the pass and a relatively large credit payout in the form of a ""private investigator fee"" that Anoleis bribes you with.
If you choose to speak with Parasini again at the hotel bar, she reintroduces herself as a Noveria Internal Affairs agent working undercover for the Executive Board that governs the planet. You can ask questions about what has been going on: apparently, Anoleis has been driving business away by increasing rent prices on Noveria facilities. He is breaking the golden rule of the planet, which is ""don't rock the boat."" Parasini asks you to convince Qui'in to testify before Board, returning to Anoleis' office to continue posing as his secretary afterward.
At this point you have three options as to what to do with the evidence you've obtained: (1) give the evidence to Anoleis, (2) give it to Qui'in, or (3) keep the evidence and use it to either force Qui'in to testify against Anoleis or force Anoleis to give you a garage pass (or both).
Option 3 allows you to maximize experience, morality points, or credits if you're able to play the Noveria game yourself. The basic steps are to talk with Gianna at the hotel, then convince Qui'in to testify, then blackmail Anoleis by telling him about the evidence in your possession. You can talk with Anoleis first if you want, as long as you keep your bargaining chip—the evidence. However, the negotiation with Anoleis must be before you tell Gianna at her desk outside his office that you convinced Qui'in. Convincing Qui'in requires you to either Charm or Intimidate him, rewarding you handsomely with either Paragon or Renegade points, respectively.
The conversation with Anoleis where you reveal you have Lorik's evidence has a few nuances to be aware of. There are three rewards that can result from the conversation, all of which provide you a garage pass, 9 Renegade points, and either (A) a small amount of XP, (B) a large amount of XP, or (C), a large amount of XP plus a sizeable credit payout. Reward A results from using the Charm dialogue option, Reward B results from using the Intimidate dialogue option, and Reward C results from accepting Anoleis' bribe, which requires no moral persuasion dialogue (pick either ""Get me to Benezia"" or ""I accept""). The rewards from this conversation are the same regardless of whether you've spoken with Gianna at the hotel or not. As Reward C requires you to hand over the evidence to Anoleis, this will preclude you from helping Gianna and receiving the associated rewards (as well as enraging her beyond endurance).
One thing to watch out for is that you get no morality points if you pick either the Charm or Intimidate options as your first choice after telling Anoleis you have Qui'in's evidence—if you want these points, pick one of the three non-persuasion options that should be on the right. All of these three options can eventually lead to any of the three rewards listed above; however, regardless of which reward you want, the actual dialogue spoken by you, Anoleis, and occasionally your squad can differ depending on the path you choose through the conversation. There are several variations, so make a save point and have fun exploring them if you're curious. It is also possible to refuse any deal with Anoleis, giving you no reward and ending the conversation, but the option to make a deal remains, you simply have to talk to him again.
Note:  Your options with Anoleis will be more limited if you already revealed Opold's smuggling in exchange for a garage pass. The Charm and Intimidate dialogue options on the left will be grayed out, and no amount of points in those talents can unlock them. Instead, you will have only three options: (1) hand over the evidence, (2) refuse to hand over the evidence, (3) exit the conversation, keeping the evidence. Only handing over the evidence gets you anything—Reward C as described above.
Once you've taken advantage of the administrator's weakened position, you can speak to Parasini and tell her you convinced Qui'in to testify before the Board (assuming you did). She will arrest Anoleis, promising Shepard a beer the next time they cross paths; this rewards Paragon points and experience. If you want to avoid getting any Renegade points, arresting Anoleis straightaway is the quickest option, though this comes with a smaller total experience reward. If you want to avoid Paragon points, you already got yourself a garage pass from arm-twisting Anoleis, so you're free and clear to leave Port Hanshan without reporting back to Gianna at all.
Apparently, you CAN bludgeon your way through bureaucracy
There is a final, rather extreme way to get yourself a garage pass. If you talked with Gianna at the hotel bar, you can inform Anoleis that she is an Internal Affairs agent; he will bring her in to ""fire"" her. Their resulting argument ends in Anoleis and Parasini killing each other, netting yourself a large reward of Renegade points. Note that returning to Lorik Qui'in in this instance will not reward you with a pass; you must take the one from Anoleis' body. Qui'in is also reluctant to reward you with anything in this path, you need to badger him for money: at least 6 Charm or 8 Intimidate is required for him to give you a measly 250 credits for your trouble.
Note: If you still haven't delivered Opold's package to any recipient you can use it to leverage a pass from Anoleis but only if the evidence hasn't been handed over to anyone for the moment and you haven't had the salarian arrested or killed yet.
Note: The wall safe in Anoleis' office can be bypassed (easy Decryption) only if he's arrested (or dies resisting arrest).
Once you are done, head to the garage or finish up on any other outstanding Port Hanshan interactions. If you feel like taking the time to travel all the way back to the docking bays to talk to her, Captain Matsuo may have a reaction to what went down in the administrator's office; your response can earn you a few more morality points."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Expose_Saren,"Prerequisite: Prologue: Find the Beacon
This mission is acquired after you arrive on the Citadel for the first time.","Udina arguing with the Council
Over the course of this mission, depending on your actions, you will have the option to change your squad once or twice for combat purposes so no need to worry about an unbalanced squad. For weapons and equipment, assuming this is your first game, anything you can get your hands on, if you can even afford it provided it's store bought, will work. If you're doing this again, whatever got you through last time should work just fine.
When you arrive at the Citadel, Ambassador Udina is arguing with the Council. After demanding action by the Council, the turian councilor cuts Udina off and says that everything will be determined at the hearing and not before. Udina berates Anderson for bringing “half the crew” with him. After answering a few questions Udina leaves and tells Shepard to meet him at the Citadel Tower, top level. You will have clearance to get in. “That’s why I hate politicians.”
Now you have the option to walk around the Presidium or head straight for the tower. You can’t leave the Presidium yet but you can explore. If you choose to explore then once out of the ambassador’s office, head right and into the elcor and volus Embassy. An elcor named Xeltan is telling the elcor ambassador that he has a problem. Talk to him to acquire the assignment Citadel: Xeltan's Complaint, but only after having spoken to General Septimus Oraka during Sha'ira's ""Asari Consort"" assignment (see below). You can talk to the elcor and volus ambassadors, however, to get codex entries and to learn more about these two species. Once you are done head out.
Report to the Council[]
Head down the stairs and you can talk to the Receptionist to get the asari codex entry. Then head up the other flight of stairs and head across to the door opposite to get a few more codex entries. Once out of that room turn right and head into the 2nd door on the left, the headquarters for C-Sec. Executor Pallin will be in there and can give a few more codex entries. Heading out of C-Sec HQ, turn left and head into the embassy lounge. Only Private Fredricks is there and can answer a few more questions about the asari consort Sha'ira. Once you leave the embassies talk to Avina and learn more about the Presidium and another codex entry.
From here you can again head for the tower or head across the bridge and go to the Consort's Chambers and talk to Nelyna. This will eventually trigger the Citadel: Asari Consort assignment. Then leave and head left to get into the market district of the Presidium. An Avina terminal is near a krogan statue. It will give some more codex entries and some information on the statue.
Once done head over to the Emporium where you can buy some goods if you want. Once done, head out and across the bridges to the Citadel Tower. Just outside the elevator to the Tower, is a third Avina terminal. Use this for a few more codex entries, then head up to the Council Chambers.
In the elevator, both Ashley and Kaidan discuss the upcoming meeting and eventually you reach the top.
Saren is too untouchable for mere C-Sec grunts
Exit and head up the passageway and eventually you see Executor Pallin and a C-Sec officer arguing. When you get close the officer is asking for more time and for Pallin to stall the Council. Pallin rebuffs the officer and leaves.
The officer notices Shepard and the squad. He introduces himself as Garrus Vakarian. You can ask him questions about his investigation and what happened. Once you are satisfied, excuse yourself any way you want. Then head further up and then select Anderson to meet with the Citadel Council. It's not necessary to talk to Anderson, simply walking past him triggers the meeting.
Shepard and Anderson join Udina on the Petitioner's Stage. The asari councilor is discussing that the geth attack on Eden Prime ""is of some concern"", but apparently the Council is not willing to believe that Saren was involved. Saren says that Nihlus was a fellow Spectre and a friend. Anderson interjects but is rebuffed by Saren. Udina brings up Powell but the salarian Councilor rebuffs that, because unreliable eyewitnesses are not valid evidence. Anderson brings up Shepard’s vision, but that was a bad idea. Saren says that he can’t defend himself against dreams, and the turian councilor agrees. The Council looks at each other and the asari councilor says that there isn’t enough evidence and Saren is not disbarred from the Spectres. The asari councilor dismisses the meeting and Udina lingers defeated.
Udina off to some business after suggesting contact with Harkin
Udina joins Shepard and Anderson off to the side and says that is was mistake to bring Anderson into the meeting. Apparently there is some history between Saren and Anderson.
You can ask about it but you need to continue. Ask questions about what to do next and Udina will say that as a Spectre, Saren is almost untouchable but he has some contacts that might come in handy. A C-Sec officer named Harkin is a good source for Udina and he suggests talking to him. If you ask for other leads, Anderson suggests talking to Barla Von.
The journal automatically gives the Citadel: Garrus mission at the end of the conversation. If Anderson recommended you to Barla Von, the journal additionally gives you the Citadel: Shadow Broker mission.
After your meeting, head back down the Council Chambers, when you reach the main landing; there will be a salarian scanning one of the keepers. You can talk to him and acquire the assignment Citadel: Scan the Keepers.
Advancing the Plot[]
Main article: Citadel: Garrus
Main article: Citadel: Wrex
You must enlist the help of people who can aid your case against Saren by talking to the people that will point you to them. Their stories are intertwined: Dr. Chloe Michel referred a quarian with incriminating evidence against Saren to Fist, a Shadow Broker agent who switched allegiances to Saren. Garrus is helping Dr. Michel against Fist's thugs, while Urdnot Wrex has been hired by the Broker to kill Fist.
All threads point to the quarian and the evidence being in danger, likely held at Fist's bar Chora's Den. Garrus and/or Wrex can be recruited into the squad at the end of their short missions. You only need one of them, though you may take them both at your discretion.
Going after Fist[]
Fist's thugs on alert
When you are getting near Chora’s Den, save your game before you get halfway to the door to the Den. Once you get close it is apparent that the Den is closed and you will have to fight your way to Fist.
Once you open the door there is little cover so send in your squadmates in first and to survive either focus on one side or the other. The bar has a gaggle of Thugs, Bartenders, and the Krogan Bouncer trying to stop you. Once one side is down use the cover to take out the rest.
Once all the initial enemies are down move around the circle bar, take out the enemy that is on top of the bar, and then use the cover near the entrance to the back to take out the two enemies there. Try not to knock over the enemies' cover, as you may need them later on the way out.
Just people caught in the wrong place at the wrong time
As one of the first big fights encountered by a brand new character, this can be quite a fight on Insanity. Consider ordering your squad to cover positions back from the doorway, near the balcony pillar, so they won't rush in and get fried; you can take cover in the doorway itself and you'll be able to use your squadmates' powers against any enemies you can see. Staying in the doorway tends to delay the activation of the Krogan Bouncer.
Be careful when the Krogan Bouncer comes around the bar - he's very tricky because of his shotgun and his charge attack; you may need to retreat and regroup before you get him down. Finally, there's a trick to revive downed squadmates: returning to the antechamber with the Citadel Rapid Transit station.
The door to Fist's inner sanctum is locked during the bar firefight, so you can't simply rush your way in. You need to take all enemies down for it to become unlocked. There's an explosive fire containment system beside the door: if you shoot at it, you can at least inflict some poison damage on entrenched goons nearby.
In the next room you will find some armed Warehouse Workers. If you have enough Charm or Intimidate points, you can talk to these workers rather than fighting them. You can persuade these workers to leave without a fight but you get the same experience points either way. Once they are gone, one way or the other, access the weapons locker on the wall opposite the next door. Save your game before you enter the door.
Fist frequently dashes from wall to wall for the cover - not that it'll do him much good
The next room contains an aggravated Fist and his last defenses, two turrets. Use the cover on either side of the room to take out Fist and turrets. Stay in cover because the turrets can rip right though your shields. The turrets and Fist for that matter tend to target Shepard rather than the squadmates. You only need to take out either both turrets or Fist himself, so focus your aim on either group.
Once Fist falls you start a conversation with him. The first thing he says is to not kill him, so take the opportunity to loosen his tongue. Shepard asks about the quarian and Fist says that she would only talk to the Shadow Broker directly. If you have Wrex or Garrus then he will say that no one talks to the Shadow Broker, only the agents. He will say that he put her in contact with the “Shadow Broker”, but there will be assassins waiting for her. Get the information then you have a choice if Wrex isn’t in the party.
Fist asks to be let go, you can choose to kill him or let him go. If Wrex is in the party then he kills him either way. Now you have 4 minutes to rescue the quarian.
Rescue the Quarian[]
Another group of thugs to delay you just when there's time pressure involved
Before leaving Fist's office, grab the OSDs on the floor for the Citadel: Reporter's Request assignment and hack Fist's safe (Easy Decryption). Once you have everything, head out and prepare to fight more enemies. Use the cover in the antechamber near the door to the main Chora's Den area to take them out without being exposed to fire from all of them at once and move up when you need to.
Note: Eliminating the enemies in the bar is not mandatory to proceed, so especially if you're running out of time, you can take a shot at running for the exit with enemies still around. A fire containment system appears next to the exit, so shoot at it if there are goons nearby.
Note: If you stand on the left side of the antechamber, a Thug will soon present himself at close range to be gunned down; if you then wait another Thug will do the same, etc, and you can whittle them down one at a time. Remember that this is a timed segment, so don't take too long.
Once you're out of Chora's Den head into the back alley behind the markets, up the stairs, and beyond the door to trigger a cutscene.
Small wonder she calls the deal off
The quarian is talking to a turian and asking for the Shadow Broker. The turian tells her that the Shadow Broker is coming, but she tells him the deal's off. The other assassins nearby pull their pistols and the quarian throws a grenade and sends them reeling.
When you regain control, killing the assassins is the last piece of fighting you need to do for the mission. They aren't especially dangerous, though at least one of them is armed with a shotgun that can hurt quite a bit if you don't seek cover. It's advisable to hit them with Sabotage or biotics immediately at the start of the fight before they all disperse.
Once the assassins are down, a dialogue sequence opens where the quarian first gets angry at Fist; you can respond any way you choose. Shepard then asks about the data and the quarian responds that she has a way to repay Shepard for saving her life. One of your squadmates recommends they continue this conversation in the Ambassador's office.
Expose Saren[]
Once back in the embassy, Udina starts on a tirade, “You aren’t making my life easy Shepard. Firefights in the wards, an all out assault on Chora’s Den. Do you know how many people…” Then Udina notices the quarian and asks who she is. Respond any way you want. Then Udina asks the quarian to start from the beginning, and she starts with her name, Tali'Zorah nar Rayya.
Everything in the near future can be deepfaked, though apparently audio recordings taken from robots is irrefutable
Udina asks why a quarian would leave the flotilla and she says that she was on her pilgrimage and was hearing reports of geth. Since the geth drove the quarians into exile, she was curious. She managed to isolate one and salvage its memory core. Since the geth usually destroy their memory cores upon termination, Anderson asks how she was able to salvage it. Ask her and she says that she knew what to look for and was lucky. She plays an audio file that clearly exposes Saren as the person who attacked Eden Prime. She plays another voice that says something about Reapers, but no one recognizes it. The geth revere the Reapers as gods and they existed and wiped out the Protheans 50,000 years ago.
That knowledge clicks with Shepard as they manage to make sense of the vision from the beacon. Tali elaborates that the geth think that Saren is the prophet for their return. Anderson says that it is irrelevant but the files prove that Saren is a traitor. Udina is all too eager to run to the Council and one of your squad members asks what to do with Tali. Shepard can allow her to join the team or ask her to stay behind, either way Tali becomes available as a squadmate.
You can pick your squad team again before you regain control. Afterward you're back in Udina's office while Anderson and Udina have gone on ahead. Make your way to the Citadel Tower; on the way to the rapid transit or Presidium elevator Samesh Bhatia flags you down for attention for the assignment Citadel: Homecoming. You can deal with this now, or later, though if you're aiming for efficiency take Ashley as a squad member before regaining control in Udina's office as she has relevant opinions on the assignment.
Once you're up on the Citadel Tower, Anderson is waiting by the steps. As before, it's not necessary to talk to him, merely strolling past him triggers the next cutscene. While Shepard and Anderson are walking to join Udina, Tali’s evidence is being played for the Council. The turian councilor agrees the evidence is irrefutable and the Council strips Saren of his Spectre status.
Between their head tilts and minuscule bodily cues the Council does something right for once
Udina however wants more; he wants a Citadel Fleet to lockdown the area and prevent the geth from attacking again. The Council warns, however, this could start a war with the Terminus Systems. Respond to that and give the Council a piece of your mind. Udina agrees and is just about to call out the Council when the asari councilor presents a different opinion. Apparently the turian councilor disagrees and says that it is too soon. You can use the dialogue option to present a different spin: Udina gets a human Spectre and the Citadel doesn’t have to send in a fleet.
Even the turian councilor can’t ignore that logic. The asari councilor asks Shepard to step forward. After a lot of grandiose words from the councilors, Shepard becomes the first human Spectre. You can respond to their gesture any way you want; the Council then says it will forward any relevant information on tracking down Saren to Udina. Afterwards, Udina and Anderson start discussing what Shepard needs to begin the mission, such as a ship, crew, and supplies. The Ambassador soon pulls Anderson away to help him with preparations.
Before leaving, Anderson mentions that Shepard should check in with the C-Sec Requisitions Officer for access to more advanced equipment, and that Shepard will get access to special training as well. Sure enough, once you regain control a pop-up message informs you that becoming a Spectre has brought with it some enhancements to Shepard's combat abilities, including the unlocking of special Spectre Training as well as higher levels of Charm and Intimidate.
Leaving the Citadel[]
Your political and military superiors have a few things to say before you go
Here you have two options, either you can leave the Citadel now or you can complete any outstanding assignments on the Citadel. While leaving you can pick up a few assignments in the Tower, talk to Admiral Kahoku on the first landing for the assignment UNC: Missing Marines, and on the way out you can talk to Garoth for the assignment UNC: Privateers.
If you choose to leave then head for the C-Sec Academy and to the center elevator to head back up to dock 422. If you didn’t recruit Garrus or Wrex earlier they will be leaning against the elevator waiting for you. You can either choose to allow them to come along, or refuse, but take them because the more squadmates the better. Head up the elevator and once at the top talk to Anderson and Udina for more information.
Anderson is being relieved of command of the SSV Normandy and the ship is now under Shepard’s command. Anderson stands respectfully but his body language says that he isn’t happy about being relieved. Choose your responses and after a time Udina leaves. You can ask Anderson questions and after you have all the information you want head into the Normandy.
Ashley, plus optionals Garrus and Wrex
Once you enter the Normandy, you enter a dialogue with Joker. You can earn some morality points based on the choices you make during the speech. Each option shows a different part of the ship and different people. Once you are done, set a course from the Galaxy Map for your next location. It is recommended that you go to Therum first, but you can go to Noveria or Feros instead.
Note:  This is a great time to talk to your crew and start developing your relationship with them. You may tour the ship and talk to them before you leave the Citadel for your next destination. You may also go over the Journal and look for any new assignments you might have acquired."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Garrus,"Prerequisite: Citadel: Expose Saren
The mission is automatically obtained during the brainstorming session after the Citadel Council hearing.","Asking Around[]
There are two ways to track down Garrus. The default is through Harkin. He may know where Garrus is, and the human is known to be a barfly at Chora's Den. Head down there, off the Lower Markets in the Wards. Using the Rapid Transit terminal is recommended, as it deposits you to within walking distance of the bar.
Two would-be assassins waiting for a certain N7 graduate to walk in
When you get near the Den, you will be attacked by two Assassins. Use the walls for cover during the skirmish. However, they love trying to flank you, and considering your low health at this point, take them out before they do the same to you.
Once the attackers are down, head into the Den, talk to Ashley and Kaidan for some interesting dialogue, then go to the back where Harkin is sitting. Note: If you haven't spoken to Barla Von yet, or gone to C-Sec Academy, then before you can speak with Harkin you can see Urdnot Wrex making threats against Fist, the Den's owner, and the Krogan Bouncer telling Wrex off. Wrex brushes aside your squad as he leaves. You can talk to the bouncer, but he isn't in the mood.
Harkin is a chatty fellow (even more so if Shepard is female), and he makes various claims about Captain Anderson: that he used to be a Spectre, but was kicked out for botching his trial mission. You can discuss this later with Anderson, but keep pressing Harkin and he will eventually direct you to Garrus. He heard that Dr. Michel at the Med Clinic has some information related to Saren and he went to go see her. Note:  When leaving the club your squadmates will have some things to say about Harkin's revelations. This may overlap with scripted events in Citadel: Rita's Sister, so do one or the other first, not at the same time.
The second method of tracking down Garrus is at the conclusion of Citadel: Wrex if you did that one first, where Wrex mentions the turian's last known location. There will be no need to speak to Harkin in this scenario (the journal section is checked automatically), and the Assassins supposedly waiting outside Chora's Den will no longer be there.
The Med Clinic[]
Doesn't look good for the rest of the thugs whatever the outcome
Make a break for the clinic, and once you open the door, there are apparently some of Fist’s thugs threatening the good doctor, while Garrus is hiding nearby, waiting for an opportunity to take them out. The thugs ask if the doctor told Garrus about the quarian and she says she hasn’t. The thugs take notice of Shepard and the squad, and Garrus takes advantage of the opportunity to put a hole in one of the thugs' heads. Then he rounds the corner and the thugs take cover.
There are three to four thugs apart from the dead one: two visible in the cutscenes, and the rest hidden at the back of the room. Use the cover from the entrance to take out the first one then move around the corner to take out the other two. There is an explosive crate near the both of them. If you have Overload, then use it on the crate for more of an effect. Usually the cover to the right will be knocked over by the explosion, making taking out the second thug easy. The others sometimes remain content hiding behind cover and crates so send in your squadmates to finish them off.
Tip: You may wish to make a permanent save point after the area is clear, as talking to Garrus may lead to one of the few opportunities to change the composition of your squad at this point in the game.
Talk to Garrus and Dr. Michel, who says the thugs were sent by Fist. Apparently, Fist is trying to hunt down an injured quarian fugitive that she treated, and eventually Michel remembers that the quarian had some sort of information about the geth. Garrus surmises that the quarian has information linking the geth to Saren, which is why Fist is trying to silence her. Garrus demands to join your squad to help you take down both Fist and Saren. If he's questioned as to why he wants to go up against a fellow turian, Garrus vehemently states that Saren is a traitor and a disgrace to his people.
If you haven't recruited Wrex, Garrus will inevitably become your team's newest member at the end of your conversation. Garrus mentions that the Shadow Broker hired the krogan to deal with Fist and that you should probably seek his help as well. You will then be able to change your squad.
However, if Wrex has joined you already, you have the option to turn down Garrus's request to join you, stating that you don't trust him. If you change your mind and want to let Garrus join you, he will remain in the med clinic up until you deal with Fist in Chora's Den. If you deal with Fist without recruiting Garrus, he can be found at C-Sec Academy, his place of employment, waiting by the elevator leading up to Dock 422 where the Normandy is berthed. You can't avoid talking to him if you try to use the elevator; he tells you he's impressed that you took down Fist. Garrus reveals he was so disgusted by being unable to do anything meaningful to stop Saren at his current post that he quit C-Sec. He still wants to join your mission, expressing frustration at being hamstrung by C-Sec's rules and red tape, noting that you were able to get the job done without any bureaucratic nonsense getting in your way.
You can either relent and allow Garrus to join you, or continue to refuse him. If you don't let him join you, he will wait leaning against a wall at C-Sec Academy for most of the remainder of the game, where you can recruit him to your mission at any time."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Wrex,"Prerequisite: Citadel: Expose Saren
After the Citadel Council hearing, David Anderson must be asked if there are other leads that can help the treason case against Saren. He refers you to Barla Von, a Shadow Broker agent who may be able to help. In this scenario, the mission is initially named Citadel: Shadow Broker. If you didn't ask Anderson immediately after the hearing, you can do so again at his place in the Embassies.
If you are accomplishing Citadel: Garrus without doing the above, at the conclusion of that mission Garrus Vakarian attempts to persuade you to enlist Urdnot Wrex into the team. The mission name is then acquired as is, and there's no need to speak with Barla Von anymore—simply go to C-Sec Academy to find Wrex there.","If the mission was obtained from Anderson, head to the financial district of the Presidium. Barla Von is located in the bank, next to the Emporium.
Once inside, Barla Von will tell you that he works for the Shadow Broker and the information he is about to give you would normally cost a small fortune, but he is giving it away for free. Apparently Saren has betrayed the Shadow Broker, not a good move, and now the Shadow Broker is very angry with him. You can respond to it anyway you want. Saren also conned a former Shadow Broker agent named Fist to change his allegiances to him. The Shadow Broker retaliated with hiring the krogan bounty hunter to deal with the problem.
After speaking with Barla Von, the mission name now changes to Citadel: Wrex. When you have all the information you need, head over to the elevator to C-Sec Academy. The elevator is located near the Embassies so the Fast Transit System is recommended, unless you feel like walking.
Wrex dares C-Sec officers to arrest him
Once you are in the academy, you will see several C-Sec academy officers near a krogan off to the right of the center elevator. You may want to make a save point before going up to them, as this will lead to one of the few opportunities to switch squadmates at this stage of the game.
When you approach the group, a cutscene plays. Apparently the officers hauled the krogan in because he was accused of making threats against Fist, and they warn him off, to little effect as the krogan only responds point-blank that he will kill Fist. After a brief but tense standoff, the officers leave and the krogan turns his attention to you. After some introductions, you discover that your goals and that of the krogan, Urdnot Wrex, align enough that you agree to let him join your team.
If Garrus hasn't been recruited yet when you speak to Wrex, or you have recruited him but you haven't yet gone to Chora's Den to deal with Fist, you will not have the option of refusing to allow Wrex to join you. If you haven't recruited Garrus, Wrex will mention that there is a turian who is also going after Fist. You can then either choose to go to the Med Clinic for Citadel: Garrus or just go to Chora's Den to deal with Fist.
If you have completed Citadel: Garrus and you have already gone to Chora's Den and dealt with Fist, you can still find Wrex down at C-Sec, but he won't be having a confrontation with officers. Instead, you will find him leaning against the elevator that leads up to Dock 422 where the Normandy is moored, and if you approach (unavoidable if you want to take the elevator up), a slightly different cutscene plays. Wrex is frustrated that you handled Fist, a job which the Shadow Broker had paid Wrex to handle. Out of professional pride, Wrex states he will gift Fist's bounty to you instead. He then asks to join your team and your mission to take on Saren. When pressed on why he would want to join you, he says that he wants to be ""where the action is"", and that Saren portends a major conflict to come. He also expresses disgust at what he sees as the servility and greed of the other krogan who fight for Saren, claiming that his people used to have more pride.
However, you may still refuse to allow a krogan on your team, in which case a miffed Wrex says that he will hang out at Chora's Den if you change your mind; he will remain there for a large majority of the rest of the game, and you can recruit him to your mission by speaking with him there at any time. Even if you refuse Wrex's initial offer to join you, you will still receive the bounty payment, a relatively large credit reward.
Regardless of the circumstances of when you first talk to him, if Wrex joins your team, you will be able to select your squad again, and then move on."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Race_Against_Time:_Conduit,"Prerequisite: Ilos: Find the Conduit
This mission is renamed from Race Against Time: Sovereign upon completion of the prerequisite mission.","Exit Vigil's chamber and on the way up your squadmates will comment that even the Protheans with all their power and knowledge still fell for the Reapers' traps. However, the other squadmate counters with the fact that they have no intention of ending up the same way. Get back into the Mako and stop Saren before he can reach the Conduit. Hit the gas and rocket down the path, which is now clear of the forcefields.
This entire mission is a linear drive toward the Conduit at the end of it. As before, there are no item pickups during the driving sections, so just stay inside the vehicle as much as possible. When you reach the bottom of the ramps from Vigil's chamber, there are three Geth Rocket Troopers that are around the entrance to the trench run. Take them out and then take a left and head into the trench.
There's no incentive to step out of the Mako, so enjoy guilt-free driving through the aqueducts
Note: If, for some reason, you ditched the Mako and traveled on foot, return to it. The game will not let you into the aqueducts without it, and you cannot leave the vehicle while you're at the ledge drop area of no return. Legendary Edition:  The game now allows you to drop from the ledge of no return on foot, but it still won't allow you to disembark the Mako at the very edge. Abandoning the vehicle is definitely not an option if you want to complete the mission successfully as you won't be able to enter the Conduit without it.
Move along the trench until you reach the first turn. This area is defended by a lot of geth, mainly 4 Rocket Troopers, 3 Geth Troopers, a Geth Shock Trooper, and a Geth Colossus.
None shall break the tranquility of the place
Before turning the corner and exposing yourself to fire from the Colossus you can separately engage and take out some of the smaller geth whether you do so from in the Mako or outside it. After turning the corner you will see a second nearby group of geth who can often be lured back down the corridor with you to be dealt with away from the Colossus. You can now safely blow away the remaining small geth using the Mako's heavy gun if you're willing to give up the rather insignificant exp you'll gain at this time.
Finally the Colossus can be whittled down with the classic method of turning the Mako sideways and rocking it back and forth to avoid projectiles. At the last moment you can get out of the Mako and kill the Colossus on foot for some bonus experience.
Head through the former battlefield and turn left and head down the backstretch. When you reach a right turn head down it and be prepared to take some fire. At the next corner are three Rocket Troopers and again are easy prey. Take the double turn and drive along until you come under attack again. This group is the same as the last and is the last in the trench. When you defeat this group, SAVE YOUR GAME because the next area can be tricky.
The calm before the storm
Before moving on, get the Mako's shields to full strength (if it's going to be a tiresome wait, saving your game and then reloading it will save time) and fully repair the Mako because if you don’t then you will probably die.
At the end of the aqueduct there's nothing left but a downward slope and the Conduit at a distance. Your Mako will stop temporarily as your squadmates comment on the Conduit: one admiring the view, and one urging haste. A somewhat lengthy cutscene commences. Do NOT be lulled to sleep during the upcoming cutscene, as you will be in a timed combat sequence immediately following.
The Battle of the Citadel begins as the Reaper and its geth allies arrive through the mass relay and unleash a devastating broadside on the unsuspecting Citadel Fleet. The Citadel forces counterattack and attempt to seal the station by closing its arms as a defensive measure, but they are unable to do so. The commander of the Destiny Ascension then orders the evacuation of the Council. The reason for the station's unresponsiveness becomes clear as the scene shifts to the Presidium where a geth throws the lifeless body of an asari aside while Saren and more of his mechanical minions enter the elevator leading to the Citadel Tower and the Council Chambers.
The approach to the Conduit
When you regain control you have only 40 seconds to get to the Conduit and use it. You will not make it on time if on foot, so you must drive, and fast. However, there are four Geth Colossi in your way who will try to stop you. Therefore, you have no time to combat them, just hit the gas and take the most direct route to the Conduit while avoiding their projectiles. Following the small river and zigzagging a little to reduce the machine gun fire from the Colossi is a reasonable plan, though driving straight at the Conduit generally works just as well. Legendary Edition: While in the original game you'll probably be cutting it close even at top speed, the Mako's rear thrusters can now ensure you reach the Conduit with a comfortable lead (but still not enough of one to kill all Colossi).
Be aware that the Mako's shields will be automatically depleted to a couple of bars when it hits the bottom of the ramp. When you get close enough to the Conduit, it will automatically take the Mako and send it to the Citadel. Warning:  Attempting to enter the Conduit on foot will result in instant death.
The only spot where you can park and snipe Colossi without triggering the cutscene
Tip: It is possible to take out 2 of the 4 Colossi before you even start the cutscene. Your best and only vantage point is a few feet from the top entrance, the boundary defined by the walls textured with many horizontal stripes: any farther out and the cutscene will start. The Colossi can be destroyed with sniper rifles, but as it will take an infernally long time to do so even with the Mako's weaponry, it isn't advisable. Kill them with the Mako gun and cannon instead.
One Colossus is to the right of the bottom of the ramp and the other is to the far left. Look for the faint blue lights. You can double zoom your sight to make it easier to see over the lip of the canyon: the left Colossus should appear as a moving white blur obscured by foliage while the right one should have much more definition."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Virmire:_Assault,"Prerequisite: Virmire: Saren's Plan
This mission is acquired after leaving the salarian camp on Virmire and beginning the attack on Saren's base.","You and your two selected squadmates jump down behind a wall and survey the area. Captain Kirrahe comes over the comm and does a quick comm check. Respond as you will. Kirrahe replies that he is starting their attack and he reminds Shepard to be on the lookout for anything that can help them.
Sneaking in the Back[]
Main article: Virmire: Assisting Kirrahe's Team
Like with the previous mission, there are multiple branching paths to take though they all end up in the same place. Consulting your map, you will be advancing generally to the west. There are four labeled places there, from east to west: Communications Tower, Satellite Uplink Tower, Refueling Platform, and Research Facility. The Satellite Uplink Tower and Research Facility cannot be missed while visiting the Communications Tower and Refueling Platform are optional.
If you intend to make things easier for Kirrahe's teams simply visit the labeled places in order, then when you reach the research facility entrances backtrack the alternate routes to sweep for killables and/or loot. Note:  This section of the mission is concurrent with the assignment Virmire: Assisting Kirrahe's Team. This page will only list the basics required to reach and enter the facility; consult the assignment page for more details on the assignment objectives and environs.
The geth's comm tower
When you gain control head forward and to the north, there is a communications tower. The outskirts is defended by a Geth Trooper and a Geth Shock Trooper. On the structure itself are two Geth Snipers (one upstairs and one downstairs), another Shock Trooper, and a Geth Destroyer. They will greet you with a hail of gunfire and red tracking beams.
The comm tower has a geth console and a weapon locker (easy decryption). Disrupt the former if you want to make headway in the concurrent assignment.
West of the communications tower there are two routes. No matter the way you choose you will run into some more geth:
North: 1 Geth Trooper and 2 Geth Assault Drones
South: 2 Geth Troopers and 1 Geth Rocket Drone
Satellite Uplink Tower
The next structure is the satellite uplink tower. It is initially defended by a Shock Trooper and a Krogan Warrior. On top of the structure is a satellite dish you can plink for the assignment, and below it is an aid station for medi-gel.
Beyond the sat uplink tower is a series of raised catwalks connecting circular platforms with ramping stairs from north to south. Halfway through the sole passage out of the sat tower the squadmate you sent to help Kirrahe radios that hostile air support has headed to refueling stations to recharge: a hint you can heed or ignore. Emerging from the catwalk, a Geth Destroyer can be seen north, and may be hidden beyond a crate. Shooting at it may alert a nearby Geth Rocket Trooper along the catwalk directly leading to the research facility. Deal with them as they're the immediate threats. Legendary Edition:  The Destroyer is less aggressive and won't even shoot or charge until you get close to it.
You now have a choice to go north to the refueling platform, south to explore what's there, or direct to the base.
Going north leads to a gaggle of geth flyers above flammable tanks, so deal with them to accomplish an assignment objective. Note:  Kirrahe's survival depends on the destruction of the flyers. Failure to do so results in the squadmate aiding the salarians taking over radio chatter duties for the rest of the mission.
Saren has some strange priorities on things to guard
South from the sat tower leads to a platform defended by two Krogan Warriors: it has a lootable crate and an explosive containment cell, the latter being conveniently placed to soften these tough enemies up. Note:  a portion of the area below the catwalk, the one bounded by the southwest walls, is inaccessible, so be wary of physics attacks that might result in you or your enemies ending up there with potentially no firing solutions or legal way out.
The long tunnel headed northeast from the circular platforms leads to an upgrade kit and a vantage point covering the base entrance. Note:  This spot is a good place to snipe the geth and krogan guards that will spawn once you get really close to the research facility through the central catwalk.
Synthetics and organics working together, who would have thought
If you explored both north and south areas before proceeding to the base, or have no interest doing so, proceed westward through the only catwalk to the research facility. When you reach the steps to the last circular platform, radio chatter will announce the result of your interference (or lack of) with the geth flyers. The platform is covered in hexagonal geth shields as well as the base entrance beyond it; and the entrance is defended by two Geth Snipers and two Krogan Warriors. Find cover as appropriate.
The krogan that appear here have a habit of walking down the bridge then charging about halfway across, then proceeding to melee and use their shotguns to fill the squad full of holes. The facility entrance has a bunch of explosive containment cells though, targeted shots may reduce the hostiles' health to manageable levels before they can get you. Insanity Tip: If you return to the sniping spot noted earlier, you can get all the geth down before any of the krogan can get to you -- plus you'll usually face the krogan one at a time instead of together. Note that you may need to approach the bridge to Saren's base closely enough to get the enemies to spawn first, before heading to the sniping point.
When the area is clear head across the bridge. Loot the wall safe (easy decryption) and crate on opposing sides of the entrance.
You now have two options to get into the base: the door on the upper level to the right of the bridge, or a path down through the base's underworks that begins to the left of the bridge. When you reach either entrance you hear radio chatter from Kirrahe or Ashley/Kaidan acknowledging you're getting close. At either end, there is a computer terminal where one of your squadmates will hack the console and say there are two options: either disable the alarms, or generate alarms on the other side of the base. If you elect to disable the alarms you will get more experience in the form of more enemies to fight. The other option will throw more enemies into Kirrahe's teams.
Once you access the console at either end, the other one will be disabled and the relevant door will remain locked. Don't worry, the base entry layout is circular so the endpoint of your chosen route is the beginning of the alternate route, just with locked off doors (enter through the sewers, you can arrive at the warehouse and vice versa). No lootables or enemies are locked out in either case. Consulting your map, if you choose the sewers you'll be going through the Maintenance Bay, Storage Room, Cell Block B, Security Office, Maintenance, then Warehouse. The order is reversed should you go through the Warehouse first. Either way, you will be progressing the mission through the Security Office.
Indoctrinated salarians in the sewers
The base underworks route requires you to decrypt the sewer door entrance (easy decryption) and fight off some indoctrinated salarians before reaching the security console in the area labeled the Maintenance Bay. On the upside, there's a technician kit there. Legendary Edition:  The sewer route now has a giant crate should you need cover near the first indoctrinated salarian.
The other route features no enemies before reaching the security console, but you may face heavy resistance immediately after opening the doors of the area labeled the Warehouse if you don't disable the alarms. Either route features hostile salarians, which elicits some comments from one of your squadmates regarding Kirrahe losing some men and indoctrination. Going through the underworks is initially stealthier, though it won't matter in the long run if you're aiming to kill everything and maximize experience points anyway.
Base Entry[]
A bunch of crates in a sneaky location that has a high chance of being overlooked if you entered the base sneaking in
Assuming you enter through the sewers, after the console door you'll see some stairs and some indoctrinated salarians lurking about in the storage room above. After dealing with them, be sure not to miss the group of four crates behind the staircase.
There's an Aid Station right by the storage room door upstairs for reference should you need the medi-gel now or for later. The door leads to more stairs and eventually you arrive in the area marked as Cell Block B on your map. In it is the Turian Intel Report terminal containing a codex entry if you haven't received it yet (easy decryption) and a hold of cells containing salarians reduced to gibbering except one who can actually talk.
You have a choice: open the doors for Paragon points and exp, or leave them be for Renegade points
When you talk to this particular salarian he introduces himself as Private Menos Avot and says that experiments have been performed on him for the six days he has been imprisoned. Your squadmates will comment on his condition and both think that something is off about him. You now have a choice: let him out, or leave him in.
If you let him out he succumbs to the ""incessant whispering"" and attacks along with the indoctrinated salarians from adjoining cells. If you choose to leave him, he doesn't take this sitting down and will try to get out by charging the glass, cracking it partially (and his skull) in the process. Letting Avot and his cellmates out nets you a fight, some exp, and Paragon points while leaving them there nets you some Renegade points (though there's no option to open their cages afterward), so as always the decision is ultimately up to you.
Saren's severe staffing problem shows when he has a couple of droolers stationed at a security office
Head out into the stairs and at the end you reach a security office that holds two more indoctrinated salarians, as weak as those who preceded them. When they are disposed of there is a hardened weapons locker (hard decryption) and a crate near where you came in. Make sure to open them before moving on. If you haven't gotten it yet, the terminal labeled Salarian Intel Report has another codex entry in it (easy decryption).
If you wish to advance to the heart of the mission faster at the expense of experience and loot, take the elevator at the center of the room to the next section. Otherwise, ignore it for now.
If you want to explore, there are two more doors in the security office aside from the elevator and the one you came in. Take the one leading out into a corridor and into Maintenance. Head across the catwalk and you will arrive at another door. You're in the right place if someone on the cells below notices your presence - ignore him for now. Beyond the door, you arrive first at an antechamber to the areas labeled Maintenance and Warehouse on your map. In this antechamber is a terminal containing an Asari Intel Report - another codex entry if you haven't received this from other avenues yet (easy decryption).
Heavy hitters and cannon fodder in one room
In the next room are two more indoctrinated salarians, a Shock Trooper, and a Geth Juggernaut. The salarians are roving around, so you might not see them initially. Shoot the salarians and use a power on the Juggernaut to keep it off balance. If you see it, aim for the explosive ion containment cell conveniently located near their starting positions.
When you take down the guards in the maintenance area, focus on the salarians and possibly geth that are coming from the lower level warehouse. If you chose to generate alarms on the other side of the base then you'll see only the salarians; otherwise you'll also face Geth Shock Troopers, Geth Troopers, Geth Rocket Troopers, and a Geth Destroyer. The three or four salarians are not a threat but the charging Destroyer is, so focus on that one first. When the attackers are down, take the medi-gel from the aid station near the stairs heading down into the warehouse before heading back. Note:  If you chose to come in through the base's upper level door rather than the underworks, this is the room you'll have entered.
The door forward leads to the warehouse while the door at the bottom left is the actual entry point to the detention cells
Head back to the security office and the take an immediate right to the door there, labeled in your map as leading to the Detention Cells. When you open the door you should be looking at a staircase heading down and to the right. It leads to the lower levels of the catwalk you were on. When you reach the bottom open the door and in the far left cell the salarian calling out to you earlier: Lieutenant Ganto Imness. Talking to this salarian will give up a lot more information than the last one that actually talked and didn't just shoot. Ganto will tell you about the threat of Indoctrination and what happened to his squad, apparently in the other cells.
You can ask him about the tests and what has been happening, and when you have all the information you want you have two options, let him go, or keep him in the cell. He will understand either way. However, giving him the chance to outrun the blast grants some Paragon points, while leaving him to die will net some Renegade points. You can actually even tell him you're leaving him, gaining the Renegade points, and then change your mind and let him out after all, gaining the Paragon points as well. Afterwards, you can also open up the cell next to his, which contains four salarians. You can just free them, or you can execute them for more Renegade points.
Once you've had your fill of exp and loot head back up to the security office and into the elevator.
Saren's Base Interior[]
For a couple of eggheads Droyas and his assistant have no problems packing heat
When you reach the top of the elevator, you arrive at the base's genophage lab. Which somehow involves experiments on husks. The enemies in the room don't immediately notice you. Interacting with the stasis console directly in front of you will instantly draw their attention, however, causing the krogan researcher Doctor Droyas, his asari assistant, and the husks in the stasis chambers to attack, so don't do this.
The asari thankfully doesn't possess any biotics that can knock you down but Droyas has Neural Shock which can, as well as a number of other nasty tech abilities, so it's a good idea to disable him ASAP before he notices you. Since you don't want to get blindsided by the husks while concentrating on him, an effective strategy is to rush across the room to the far end where there are no husks.
There are only two doors in the area: the elevator, and an initially locked one at the middle of the room. When all enemies are down the door unlocks and you can start looting the area: near the elevator is an upgrade kit and also a wetware kit, and on the other side of the room is a medical station (easy decryption). When you are done, head out of the lab via the door, and take out the two Geth Troopers blocking your way to another security office. The drawbridge nearby will be lowered later; ignore it for now.
Remember this gal, you'll be seeing her again in unexpected places if you let her live
When you enter the room there is an asari behind a desk. She introduces herself as Rana Thanoptis, a scientist that is in a more permanent position than she would have wanted. You can ask questions and she gives a lot more information about indoctrination and Saren’s flagship, Sovereign. If you keep asking questions then she gives up a wealth of information and access to Saren's private lab. Now you have the option to either let her go or kill her; she'll make cameos in future Mass Effect games if you let her go.
Rana's office has a secure weapon locker (average decryption) by way of lootables. Take the elevator to Saren's lab and at the top is another beacon, and your squadmates remark that it is the same as the one on Eden Prime. Interacting with the beacon is the point of no return for the earliest sections of the mission. Ensure you already explored, looted and killed everything you need prior to this as backtracking will become impossible.
When you activate the beacon, it transmits the full vision into Shepard's brain; unlike the last time, this beacon doesn't explode, and the Commander remains conscious. After Shepard is released, the squad walks up the stairs and across the overhead catwalk, with a red hologram for controls appearing there. When you get closer a red hologram of something else appears.
The vanguard of your destruction, or so he claims
The hologram begins talking and after just a few seconds, Shepard and the squad come to the realization that Sovereign isn't a Reaper ship, but an actual Reaper. You can ask Sovereign questions and it is willing enough to indulge Shepard for a time. However, after learning that the Reapers are doing what they do for reasons that cannot be understood by organics, and about the destruction of the Protheans, Sovereign ends the conversation and suddenly all the glass around the lab shatters.
Destroy Saren's Base[]
Joker informs you that Sovereign just pulled a turn that would shear any ship in the Alliance Navy in half. Move out and back to the elevator. When you exit the upper elevator station, a Geth Destroyer is waiting for you across the bridge, so make sure not to disappoint. Before you arrive outside Rana's former office, radio chatter from Kirrahe or Ashley/Kaidan confirms the geth have been rattled due to your actions. Head into the office, exit, and you'll see the drawbridges leading back the way you came from raised and the one in front of the squad lowered.
No need to wait for the muzzle flash to die down, it's always a good time to charge an enemy to tear their guts out
On the other side of the now-accessible drawbridge are three Krogan Warriors, and they're at the far end so they can't do that much damage yet. Send your squadmates up and be sure to keep an eye on them because the krogan will usually charge. Using Lift on the krogan when they charge will often send them out of the playable area for an instant kill. When the krogan are down move through the tunnel and exit.
You're now out of the labs and into the base main level, and your map labels the next place you're going to as Turret Control. Further on the path banks upwards and along the left, though on a lower platform there are three crates (one requires average electronics, one requires average decryption, and one has no security). When you reach the turn you'll be greeted with the sight of a large AA gun. One of your squadmates are concerned it could punch holes on the Normandy. Fortunately the controls to disable it are nearby, though unfortunately it's defended by three Rocket Drones, another Krogan Warrior, a Geth Stalker, and a Geth Ghost.
Hoppers and flyers galore
On the lower platform by the sea again there are two crates: an upgrade kit and a secure crate (average decryption). The krogan is also on the lower platform and is quite easy to send flying into the abyss using Lift, then Throw. Then focus on the annoying Geth Hoppers jumping around, while being mindful not to take rockets to the face from the Rocket Drones around the corner. There are some explosive plasma containment cells in the area, though you may want to reserve it for later.
Insanity Tip: On the highest levels it's recommended you disable the hoppers first due to the Ghost's one-shot Assassination capability and the Stalker's constant threat of Sabotage. Stun them with a Lift, subvert them with AI Hacking, or Sabotage their weapons. The area is also open-air, the Hoppers can be whittled down from afar with basic targeting then strafing for cover.
They could've chosen to soak up the surf and sun, but nope, still helping the big bad overlord with his evil plans
When you head up to the controls and deactivate the AA tower your squad advises you to turn around because there are some geth that apparently followed you up the elevator you came in. A Rocket Trooper and a Shock Trooper show up. There is little cover, though you really don't need it because the geth are a pushover. Shortly after, the salarian team's leader radios congratulations on taking down the tower, musing it's now their turn to deal with the other turret. Loot the wall safe and the secure weapon locker (average decryption) before activating the elevator.
When you activate the elevator be prepared because it doesn't come up empty. Inside the elevator are two Geth Troopers and a Geth Shock Trooper. Take them out and then take the elevator yourself.
You arrive at a short corridor with an Aid Station near the exit. The salarian team's leader radios their activities once you reach the door, and after that you are in one of the krogan breeding trenches. There are two Geth Stalkers jumping around so make sure to put them out of their misery; none of the dangerous Ghosts for now. Head across the room shooting as you go and using the cover as necessary.
Sort of weird to have the counterterrorists planting bombs
When you reach the door Kirrahe or Ashley/Kaidan tells everyone to bunker down as the charges have been set. Open it to reveal a large empty (but watery) space. Joker is elated at the AA towers' destruction, and shortly the Normandy arrives as well.
Planting The Bomb[]
The squadmate you didn't send with Kirrahe earlier walks down the Normandy's ramp with the salarian drive core that has been converted into a nuclear bomb. As the bomb is placed near the geothermal taps that power the base, and its one weak point, your other squadmate comes over the radio saying that they are pinned down on the second AA tower. The squadmate with you says to go because they still need a few minutes to finish the arming sequence, so do so. You have the option to reselect your squad at this point because you will have access to neither Kaidan nor Ashley at this point, no matter your choices. Insanity Tip: Unless Shepard is a biotic, you may want to include Liara in this squad for her crowd control abilities as you will be facing a lot of enemies in small spaces going forward.
Three semi-invulnerable charging tanks and two insta-kill assassins? Trivial issue with the Force -er, biotics
When you regain control head to the door to your right, and be prepared for yet another fight. In this trench are two Krogan Warriors, a Krogan Warlord, and two Geth Ghosts. First order of business is to get into cover fast to avoid Assassination by the hoppers and then keep an eye on the Warlord because he has a habit of charging before the rest. He also has a habit of going just after Shepard and leaving the rest of the squad alone.
When the Warlord goes down, focus on the geth then the remaining krogan. Finally when the attackers are down, run across and take the elevator up. Insanity Tips: On Insanity this battle is a lot more dangerous than it initially looks because of the nature of the enemies and the fairly tight space. Consider remaining outside the main door and picking off both of the Ghosts to simplify the situation, and then see if you can lure over one krogan at a time.
When you reach the top head to your left and make sure to loot the crate before heading up the ramp. When you walk up the stairs you are treated to a cutscene as a Geth Dropship flies overhead, as well as a big decision.
Saving a Squadmate[]
Shepard radios the squadmate back at the bomb site, they say that the geth are dropping in all over the place and they arm the bomb. If you ask, then they will say that they are making sure the bomb goes off no matter what. Then the same dialogue no matter where Kaidan or Ashley are. Both are insistent that Shepard go and save the other one. Because there is no time to save both, you must now pick a single squadmate to save: Kaidan or Ashley.
Make your choice.
Taking the elevator down or up has never been more life-changing
Depending on whom you choose to save you will either continue to the AA tower or head back to the bomb site. Whichever route you take you'll be forced to follow that option until the end of the mission. If you choose to continue to the AA tower, the elevator back will be disabled. If you choose to return to the bomb site, the door to the AA tower will be disabled.
You will lose all the equipment on the squad member you do not save.
The AA tower route has two possible item pickups while heading back has none.
The salarian team will be rescued regardless of your choice here, though if you choose to go to the AA Tower they will be fighting in that location along with the squadmate you assigned to their unit. Kirrahe's survival is entirely dependent on taking out the geth flyers earlier.
Even though your choice here will likely hinge on which character you wish to save, the fight at the bomb site is almost certain to be more challenging on higher difficulties: there are more enemies, fewer allies, and less cover. This can be something to remember for any future playthroughs even if it's no help now.
On a cinematic note, if you head to the AA Tower there you will eventually get to see a brief cutscene of the bomb site squad member's heroic stand. If you go to the bomb site instead, a cutscene will show Shepard hefting the wounded squadmate into a fireman's carry.
Two short but different musical themes play depending on how you respond to the squadmate you're sacrificing: a somber one for top/center farewells, and a smoldering one for the bottom responses.
Option 1: AA Tower[]
Salarians on the AA tower outgunned and outnumbered
Keep heading down the path, which leads to an elevator, which leads to a small antechamber beneath the AA tower. Loot the Hardened Weapon Locker (hard decryption) and the medi gel from the Aid Station. Another elevator leads up to the AA tower itself, once you are ready save your game and head up. Once the elevator opens, draw weapons and head around until you can see geth attacking the remaining salarians. So oblige and attack the geth before they have a chance to do more damage.
The elevator opens away from the geth, giving you time to pick a path. Your right-hand side has a wall for cover and a clear firing path to the geth, and your left-hand side also has a wall for cover but with much of the view obstructed by a bunch of nearby crates. Both have their obvious advantages and disadvantages. There are 2 fuel tanks at the far end (one is obstructed by a crate if coming in from your right and the other is almost obscured by the near crates if you're coming in from the left) and there are also 2 fuel tanks at each side (may not be readily visible depending on where you are). You may want to blow them up to burn any geth inbound or nearby. You may also want to save some for the coming boss fight. Your call. Legendary Edition:  Crate/cover placement has been modified such that there are now more of them along the center area. The fuel tanks are also omitted from the level.
The second the last geth falls a cutscene starts where Saren appears overhead and barrages Shepard and the squad with biotic attacks from his hover-platform. Eventually after an attack that forces Shepard into cover Saren lands and begins a conversation.
He is impressed because his geth thought that the salarians were the real threat. Over the course of conversation you can get a lot of information about why Saren betrayed the Council and what Sovereign's motives are. If certain dialogue options are chosen, you are presented with Charm and Intimidate options. Using either of them will yield morality points as well as facilitate another persuasion check later in the game.
Saren Taunts Shepard
No matter what you say to Saren, it soon becomes clear that words will not be enough to stop him. Here at the AA tower, no matter where you are after finishing off the geth you resume the fight after the cutscene in cover to the left of the elevator.
Original Mass Effect:
Saren is essentially out in the open, but while riding his platform he is immune to biotic attacks except for Warp and Stasis. He usually focuses on Shepard and leaves the remaining squad members alone, so spread out but don't hesitate to have them join the fight.
Because there is a lot of cover here use it to your advantage and take shots at Saren until the fight ends. Other than that, just keep your defensive abilities active, Sabotage Saren's weapons and use Damping to stifle his abilities as often as possible, and you should be fine. Tip: Saren will sometimes hover over places where fuel tanks are, so lucky for you if he does on a fuel tank you refrained from destroying. You can blow it up for great justice—use Sabotage for maximum effect.
Legendary Edition:
Of course a boss always fights with his goons
This fight has changed dramatically in Legendary Edition. First of all there are no fuel tanks to the sides that you can use to take out chunks of Saren's health. Secondly, although Saren will initially exchange some shots and perhaps powers with you, he will soon begin summoning waves of Geth Troopers, Geth Shock Troopers, and eventually Geth Snipers and Geth Destroyers. Head over to the elevator entrance—this gives you a place to defend, and you can hide in the elevator itself if you need to recharge your shield.
The geth will advance on you, and you will need to protect both your right and left flanks. Meanwhile Saren will be hovering and moving back and forth, and will unleash withering firepower and eventually rockets on anyone who ventures very far out of cover. When the initial wave of geth is down he will waste little time before summoning another. Again you will need to manage your flanks carefully, keep your squadmates alive, and gradually whittle away the geth. Ideally you'll also get some free moments to concentrate fire on Saren and do him some damage.
The fight ends immediately when you manage to lower Saren's health bar to 50%, so you can choose how you divide your resources between whittling him down and holding back the geth.
Option 2: Back to the Bomb Site[]
Geth headcount: 2 Snipers, a Destroyer, a Juggernaut and a Prime
When you reenter the bomb site, take cover immediately behind the large box right there on your left. There are a few more geth, mainly Destroyers and Shock Troopers—but on higher difficulty levels there will be a Juggernaut, two Snipers, and also a Geth Prime as icing on the cake. Primes are very dangerous foes to face on foot as they deal heavy damage and possess a dangerous suite of abilities including Damping that can seriously hamper your entire party. Try to disable it ASAP with your own Damping, or abilities such as Stasis, Lift, and Sabotage before it can bring its formidable arsenal to bear.
There is very little cover here, from the door your only cover is a stack of man-sized crates. On the upside, the geth are in a shooting gallery. If you're playing the original Mass Effect there are 4 fuel tanks in the area, assuming your trigger finger didn't get itchy and destroyed them on first arrival earlier, that you can shoot when geth are nearby to end the fight quickly. If you can save any, they may be useful at the upcoming boss fight.
The second the last geth falls a cutscene starts where Saren appears overhead and barrages Shepard and the squad with biotic attacks from his hover-platform. Eventually after an attack that blows Shepard into cover Saren lands and begins a conversation.
Saren on his hovercraft
He is impressed because his geth thought that the salarians were the real threat. Over the course of conversation you can get a lot of information about why Saren betrayed the Council and what Sovereign's motives are. If certain dialogue options are chosen, you are presented with Charm and Intimidate options. Using either of them will yield morality points as well as facilitate another persuasion check later in the game.
No matter what you say to Saren, it soon becomes clear that words will not be enough to stop him. Here at the bombsite, no matter where you are after finishing off the geth you resume the fight after the cutscene in cover to the left of the cylindrical structure, a bit back from the door you came in and a bit further back from the initial cover of man-sized crates near the door.
Original Mass Effect:
Use the cover that is provided to shoot at Saren until the fight is over. Saren is essentially out in the open here, but while riding his platform he is basically immune to biotic attacks except for Warp and Stasis. The best way is to order your squadmates to attack Saren because he usually focuses on Shepard and leaves the remaining squad members alone.
Because there is little cover here, keep moving as you use powers and gunfire to take out Saren before he can do the same to you. If you desperately need cover go to the door where you just came from. Keep your defensive abilities active, use Sabotage and Damping to suppress his weapons and abilities, and stay on the move, and you should be fine. Tip: Saren will sometimes hover over places where the fuel tanks are, so lucky for you if he does on a fuel tank you refrained from destroying. You can then shoot or even better Sabotage to cause him a lot of damage.
Legendary Edition:
Nowhere to hide? Try going on the offensive instead of turtling or camping
This fight has changed dramatically. First of all there are no fuel tanks that you can use to take out chunks of Saren's health. Secondly, although Saren will initially exchange some shots and perhaps powers with you, he will soon begin summoning waves of Geth Troopers, Geth Shock Troopers, and eventually Geth Snipers and Geth Destroyers. The geth will advance on you from both sides of the circular structure, and so part of your challenge is to keep from getting surrounded in a situation where you have nowhere to hide when you need to restore your shields.
One strategy is to alternate between destroying or pushing back the ones on the left, and then the right, and so forth. Meanwhile Saren will be hovering and moving back and forth, and will unleash withering firepower on anyone who ventures very far out of cover. When the initial wave of geth is down he will waste little time before summoning another. Again you will need to manage your flanks carefully, keep your squadmates alive, and gradually whittle away the geth. Ideally you'll also get some free moments to concentrate fire on Saren and do him some damage.
The fight ends immediately when you manage to lower Saren's health bar to 50%, so you can choose how you divide your resources between whittling him down and holding back the geth."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Feros:_Geth_Attack,"Prerequisite: Citadel: Expose Saren
This mission is acquired after Shepard is given Spectre status. Upon reaching Dock 422 afterward, Udina and Anderson are standing next to the SSV Normandy's entrance and will brief you on your next moves after granting you command of the ship.
Udina relays reports of geth sightings on Feros. Anderson's speech about the planet is that it is a very young colony. It's covered with an old Prothean megatropolis that covers about 2/3rds of the planet. Anderson says that the colonists were attempting to build on what the Protheans left behind.","Head to Feros in the Theseus system of the Attican Beta cluster.
Arrival on Feros[]
Just another ordinary docking bay on an ordinary planet... until it isn't
On the approach to Feros, unlike the Citadel and Noveria, no one is responding to hails and no one contacts the Normandy. Prep yourself and your squad for a lengthy adventure.
After exiting the Normandy head down the platform and you will run into David Al Talaqani. He welcomes you and tells you that their leader Fai Dan wants to speak with you. Respond with what you will, no matter what you say David will tell you to speak to Fai Dan, then some geth come up and promptly shoot him in the back.
The initial wave of enemies consists of Geth Troopers and a Geth Shock Trooper. Deal with them; put your squadmates in the limited cover that exists. Further ahead there are a few more Troopers, Shock Troopers, and a Geth Sniper that will block your path. The geth will frequently not use the cover or move out of it so don’t worry if you can’t get at them, they will do that themselves. Note:  Throughout this mission the numbers and types of enemies will scale based on your current level - for instance the enemy count may vary if you have a low level character, even if you are playing on high difficulty level.
Once the geth fall move up and head up the stairs. You are treated to a quick cutscene showing some Geth Hoppers jumping around and Shepard and the squad moving into the stairwell. When you regain control head up the stairs and watch for the Hoppers - they're fast and agile harassment units and are difficult to track and take down. Use some biotics to get them off balance and then it will be easy to take them out; if not then make them fall into the abyss. Head up the stairs and into the colony, or what’s left of it.
Zhu's Hope[]
Everybody contributes to defense, from rent-a-cops to the leaders themselves
When you get to the top of the stairs you come across some defense barriers where two people are arguing about who is going to go and look for geth. Go past them and into the structure ahead of you. Really it is a downed freighter, the Borealis, but just keep going. You may have noticed a few named people around, but at this point they can only offer perfunctory one-liner dialogues and can be mostly ignored.
Your map points to Fai Dan's location. You may go around the Borealis to get there, or through the ship itself. If you enter the ship, you can encounter Calantha Blake lying on a cot and Hollis Blake by her side. Interact with Calantha for +2 morality points in either direction, and gain a Codex entry from the terminal in their room if you haven't obtained it from other sources yet.
Legendary Edition:  The Asari Clone no longer targets Shepard with her biotic knockdown ability; however, you can still get hit by it and incapacitated when she targets a squadmate.
When you reach Fai Dan's location, he's accompanied by Arcelia Silva Martinez. Strike up a conversation with them since attempting to proceed further will do it for you anyway. Fai Dan will thank you for your arrival, and rebuffs Arcelia who scoffs at you being late arriving to the battle, and only bringing three people. However your conversation is cut short as more geth arrive, and Arcelia instructs you toward the tower.
Tower Trouble[]
They can't be reasoned with. They don't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And they absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead
When you regain control of Shepard, take cover behind the defensive barriers to safely deal with the mass Shock Troopers, Troopers, and Snipers that attack you. The colonists also fire their weapons at the geth, but this is your show, not theirs, so it's still your responsibility to do most of the fighting. Once you manage to take out the geth, head up the stairs and on the stairs you may encounter yet more Hoppers depending on your level. Destroy them and keep moving up the stairs.
When you reach the top you will hear a colonist panicking because they are being chased by geth. There is nothing you can do to save the colonist but take out the geth that killed him. Because there is little cover here watch your health and shields as you combat the geth.
Once you are done dealing with them, head through the door. Turn left to keep going and complete the current objective at the tower, or turn right to detour into the tunnels, gain some exp fighting more geth, and make preemptive progress on some of the upcoming assignments. For simplicity's sake push forward to the tower for now; the context of events at the tunnels will be explained later.
It takes a special kind of stupid (or a speedrunner) to provoke all of them into coming out at once
When that's settled, head to the upper level and use the limited cover to your advantage as you take out the few geth that are in the room. The enemies there are positioned and attack in a sequential manner: first you'll see three Troopers, then two Geth Recon Drones arrive out of the broken ceiling. Shock Troopers and a Sniper emerge from the back end of the room, and finally there's a Geth Destroyer. An additional three Troopers are deployed from the sky once initial enemy numbers drop too low. Stay in cover and take them out, you can move if necessary but shoot the Destroyer at a distance otherwise they will get up close and personal with their shotguns and melee you and the squad.
Insanity Tips: If you're playing this in Insanity and have a low level character, the above fight can be very tough because your squadmates don't have much cover and enemies try to flank and charge you. Recommended is to stay in the very entrance area and give your squadmates an explicit order to stay there. Edge out and kill some of the easy initial targets; then the drones and shock troopers will appear -- retreat back into the entry alcove to deal with them without being sniped and so forth. Then rest until your health is full and abilities are active before taking out the Sniper which will shoot you down if you're careless. After that you're safe to emerge with your squad and lay waste to the remaining geth.
The heat's too hot to handle
Once all the geth have fallen, a short cutscene will play showing a geth dropship leaving. One of your squadmates will say that they should report to Fai Dan and tell him that the tower is clear. Before heading back however, go to the other end of the tower, opposite the entrance, because there will be a Medical Station (easy decryption) and an upgrade kit there waiting to be picked up. When you have them, head back to Fai Dan, and don’t worry because there are no more enemies for now.
When you report back to Fai Dan he will thank you for clearing the tower but there are apparently still geth in the tunnels below the colony. The colony is in dire straits because of the ongoing attack and its myriad other problems, and you can ask him about what is needed to get the colony back on its feet. He will direct you to the appropriate person and you can pick up an associated assignment:
Water Problem: Feros: Water Restoration: Macha Doyle
Find her near the entrance to the colony that leads back to the Normandy, near a pipe
Food Problem: Feros: Varren Meat: Davin Reynolds
Find him in the downed ship, the Borealis
Power Shortage: Feros: Power Cells: May O'Connell
Find her near the power generator near the entrance.
Geth Problem: Feros: Geth in the Tunnels
Macha by the water pipe, May next to the generator, Reynolds inside the Borealis
You can bypass these assignments; whether or not you complete them will impact the fate of the colony. Even if you don't plan to save Zhu's Hope, there's little reason not to do them, as the exp, credits, and equipment that you can earn are well worth the time. You need not actually start off by walking around and talk to the people involved in order to do the assignments: it is possible to do any or all of the assignments first and only return to talk to the folks around the colony afterwards.
Before you leave, however, peek at the Public Extranet Terminal inside the ship for a codex entry, and hack a terminal in one of the pods of the freighter for the assignment Investigate Shipments (the terminal is only accessible if you have not already received the assignment from Admiral Hackett). Legendary Edition:  After hacking, you can hack again by saving and reloading.
If you haven’t already, talk to Ledra to unload some materials and maybe acquire some licenses. Tip: If you happen to favor shotguns for some of your squad members, the Tornado models Ledra sells are some of the best available for their level - definitely worth checking against your current shotgun.
Head out when you're ready, up the stairs past Fai Dan and Arcelia then a right turn. A previously inaccessible door is now open, an elevator to a garage fronting the skyway to ExoGeni Headquarters. Ignore the elevator if you choose to handle the tunnels situation, or skip to here in the walkthrough if otherwise.
Into the Tunnels[]
Easy to think there's a lot more of them without Combat Scanners equipped
Continue past the elevator and head down the stairs. About halfway down you'll hear a colonist running from the geth, though she doesn't get far before she's gunned down. There's a Stalker, a Trooper, and a Recon Drone here, so deal with them. When you are finished, head down and into the tunnels proper.
When you reach the lowest level of the colony follow the path until you reach an underground reservoir. Consulting your map, the route to take should be fairly straightforward with an impending crossroads ahead. Before the crossroads, you'll encounter two Shock Troopers and a Trooper. Take them out, and inspect the tunnel they're in for two of the three water valves pertaining to Feros: Water Restoration. You can't miss them, they're white contraptions attached to pipes right by the steps in and out of the corridor.
To the left are some fishdogs, to the right are some flashlight heads, and going forward some more flashlight heads and some water switches
After this corridor is the aforementioned crossroads. Left and right lead to doorways, while forward goes to the farthest reaches of the tunnel complex. Go right to complete the Feros: Geth in the Tunnels assignment. Go left to complete Feros: Varren Meat and the Feros: Power Cells assignments. Go forward to find the third water valve for completion of Feros: Water Restoration.
At the furthest north of the tunnel system loiters a guy named Ian Newstead. You may ask him some questions as he's behaving strangely.
Depending on the end you choose for the conversation Ian will note incoming hostiles and two Geth Troopers indeed appear behind you. If you want to spawn the geth, ask him the two questions which appear on the left side; avoiding the questions by choosing the right-hand statements results in no encounter. Shoot them full of holes if they appear, and then head back, because talking to Ian again will not resume the conversation and he will just spout nonsense. Whichever the case, an autosave is generated after your talk with Ian.
Heading Back[]
They don't like wasting time do they
If you did any of the assignments, then you will be greeted by some more geth when you reenter the first tunnel. You can use the cover provided to take out the attackers: a Shock Trooper, a Sniper, and a Destroyer.
When you get back up to the elevator, and before taking it, if you did the assignments go back to the colonists first to collect your rewards because otherwise you may not be able to later. Talk to the relevant folks and get the associated rewards. Offload your loot to Ledra and/or buy some of his stuff as well. Note:  This is the last convenient opportunity to return to the Normandy and select the squadmates and equipment for the rest of Feros.
The Long and Bumpy Road[]
Now head back up the stairs and take the elevator. When you get to the top you'll find some colonists fighting a Geth Assault Drone, so assist them and then climb into the Mako for the trip.
First, some primers on what to expect on the road. When traveling to ExoGeni Headquarters you will encounter many geth, including large Geth Armatures. Remember that kills on foot net more experience points in the original version of Mass Effect while in Legendary Edition there are no more experience penalties for killing while in the Mako. Alternatively, if you are careful, you can tip the enemies over the edge of the skyway by ramming them for your own amusement. Try to avoid falling off the skyway yourself because you will die. Sporadically there are fires burning on the road, and it should be obvious you should avoid them whether on foot or Mako as they're level 3 hazards.
If you're speedrunning the game, the combined firepower of enemies present won't be dangerous enough to destroy your vehicle. Be wary, though, of the numerous obstacles that might knock your Mako off in physics-defying directions. Conversely, you can exit the Mako and proceed on foot after the initial requirement of boarding it to enter the skyway, but there's no benefit for doing so as the way to the HQ is long.
Lootable crates guarded by geth exist beneath parts of the skyway
As you move along the skyway, you may notice some red dots on your radar when no geth seem to be around - those geth are under the skyway, reachable through the little passageways you will see in the middle. These often have lootables, making it worth your while to get off the vehicle and collect them. Note:  There are numerous Czech hedgehogs along the skyway. While these can be easily pushed aside by the Mako (or with effort using biotics), try to angle your vehicle to shove them away from an under-the-skyway passage entrance as these cannot be moved by any other means and may seriously impede your ability to explore said passage. In the original version of the game they can be destroyed with the Mako's main gun, though in Legendary Edition they are indestructible objects (if you wait for a while or drive away, when the game wipes the geth corpses the obstacles may disappear as well). Therefore, just shove them aside properly for less hassle whichever version you're playing.
Mako Tip: Geth that shoot relatively slow-moving large projectiles, such as the Armatures, will always aim for the front tip of the Mako. Turn your Mako perpendicular to them, and you will quickly get the hang of rocking back and forth without ever being hit. Even better there are several encounters in this section where you can hide the front of the Mako behind a door or bulkhead while leaving the gun free to fire. Aim directly at the geth when hosing them down with the Mako's machine gun, but aim at the ground at a geth's feet when firing the ""big gun"". With practice you can make it through this entire section on Insanity level without ever losing the Mako's shield.
To exit the initial garage area, you must be in the Mako. One of your squadmates will snark about heading into the geth base. The door will then open, and shortly after you exit, a cutscene will play in which a Geth Dropship drops two Geth Armatures. You can retreat back into the garage and exit the Mako to save your game, BUT if you reload without defeating the Armatures, they will have vanished.
Geared for distance warfare, but easy pickings for Mako rammings
Right after gaining control, about 280 meters away you'll see the first of two geth groups before the halfway point of the journey: the two Armatures, two Shock Troopers, and one Geth Rocket Trooper. Take them out either on foot or from the Mako. A few meters away from the garage you will hear a radio transmission, but your squadmates can't pin down the source. When you reach the (former) position of the geth enemies you'll hear more chatter, this time talking about someone named Lizbeth Baynham.
Further along the road the woman talking on the radio reveals Lizbeth is her daughter. At that point you should encounter the next group of geth defenders on the skyway: an Armature, two Rocket Troopers, and a Shock Trooper. This group is next to the first of three aforementioned under-the-skyway passages, which has a Geth Trooper inside. When you've dealt with them, turn your attention to the lootables: a locked crate (easy decryption) and a technician kit. Get back into the Mako and head through the door at the distance when you're done.
Skyway Weigh Station[]
Inside the skyway weigh station you'll hear another transmission: someone saying that they can hear a vehicle, yours, and that it’s clearly not the geth. When you see a large platform to your left and a stairwell heading down, you can ignore the area for the moment as you will find out about it later, or you can exit the Mako and head down to investigate. Their radio chatter will change depending on whether you meet them first or move forward first.
Meeting them is optional, but rewarding for the curious
When you reach the bottom you see a group of refugees, and you begin a conversation with Ethan Jeong and Juliana Baynham. Juliana is one of the people you've been hearing on the radio: she thanks you for your arrival and tells you of what happened during the geth attack and of her daughter who might still be alive in the ExoGeni headquarters. Juliana is cooperative and gives you a good amount of information, while Jeong is more concerned with ExoGeni and its reputation; he is also generally uncooperative as he is more concerned with a lawsuit or the like.
You can talk to the guards and refugees, though they're basically riffs about the same topics. The guards toe the company line and reiterate the situation on Feros is unusual while the refugees mostly complain about the lack of support from ExoGeni and how overwhelming the geth are as adversaries.
When you have all the information you want, or just get tired of Jeong, end the conversation and then head over to the left and talk to Gavin Hossle. He has just a small task for you. Since you are already going to ExoGeni, accept it because you will get some credits later. Tip: If you are in a hurry, it is possible to pick up Hossle's assignment without triggering the conversation with Jeong and Baynham by taking a sharp left at the first opportunity and carefully staying as far from them as possible while walking over to Hossle. There is no change in the later outcomes if you do this.
The Long and Bumpy Road, Part 2[]
Heavy weapons against heavy armor
When you are done leave and head back to the Mako. Drive up and around to exit the station. There's a recommended save point when you reach the top just before the door.
When you exit there are more geth awaiting you outside and behind barriers, one of each: an Armature, a Trooper, a Shock Trooper, and a Rocket Trooper. Roll up slowly and back if you need to, the door will close on its own. When you reach their position, there is another transmission - ""the package is secured"" - signalling another opportunity to hunt geth underneath the skyway. There are two Troopers in the tunnels, and the lootables are a medical kit and an upgrade kit.
When you move a little farther along you hear another transmission, but this one is panicked. On your right you should see another opening under the skyway so exit and head down for your third and final of these under-the-skyway encounters. In this area you'll find up to four Geth Troopers, two human corpses, and a single crate. Take out the geth and grab the loot then reenter the Mako and continue. When you get closer to ExoGeni’s garage there is a final round of large geth, as usual scaled to your level. Enemy composition could have three Geth Juggernauts and an Armature.
When the final geth falls head inside ExoGeni HQ and serve the geth an eviction notice.
ExoGeni HQ[]
Being the game protagonist doesn't automatically mean tanking and surviving three simultaneous heavy hits
When you reach ExoGeni's garage, your radar gets jammed, unless you have the appropriate Weapons Upgrades. Exit the Mako and proceed on foot since you'll pass through a narrow opening that the vehicle can't conventionally squeeze through. The enemies waiting beyond are a Shock Trooper on the same floor as you, a Trooper and a Rocket Trooper on a higher platform, and a Geth Sapper and a Geth Stalker jumping around from place to place. Tip: If XP reduction is irrelevant to your case, you can take almost all of them out with the heavy explosive rounds from the Mako's gun just by firing in through the opening.
Once all the geth are down head up the ramp and take in the blasted surroundings. At one end is a weakly secured door (easy decryption), and at another end is an energy barrier you can't penetrate.
Inside the door is a deactivated Armature, a malfunctioning object, and a fusion containment cell. Don’t shoot the explosive canister for the moment. The second you loot the malfunctioning object in the room, the Armature wakes up, so shoot (or better yet Overload) the container, then use biotics to take the Armature off balance or tech talents to keep it from disintegrating you. Killing this Armature is strictly optional, however.
Take the one-way drop only if you have no desire to backtrack
The way around the barrier is a one-way drop near it leading inside ExoGeni HQ. Warning:  This is a point of no return for going offworld, chatting up colonists, offloading accumulated items, or changing squadmates at the Normandy. Once you drop down major story developments will occur, and when you get back out you'll be returning to a markedly changed colony. Your squadmate choices will be locked for the rest of the Feros story arc.
When you've committed your choice, you emerge into a huge cavern. A cutscene starts where someone shoots and the shot gets deflected by Shepard’s shields. The person approaches and apologizes, you can respond to that and she eventually introduces herself as Lizbeth Baynham. You can ask her some questions about what the geth are doing on Feros and she replies that they are probably there for the Thorian. You can ask about it but she apparently doesn’t know much. When you are done, she will give you her ID badge and she will go and hide, again.
When the conversation ends, you will be attacked by about 7 varren so watch out. Because there is no cover here and the varren all attack at once, it can devolve into a challenging fight, especially at lower levels and on harder difficulties.
Beware of scale-itch
There is a piece of wood bridging a gap between two concrete pillars in the middle of the area - get out to the end of it as quickly as possible, before the varren swarm you. The varren will have a hard time reaching you there, and will often clump up making themselves vulnerable to area effect abilities. If worst comes to worst you can jump off and they will take the long way round to find you again. Biotics such as Lift, Throw, and Singularity are handy for keeping the varren away from you while you whittle their numbers. Likewise consider equipping shotguns for all party members even those not trained in them - especially if you have Hammerhead rounds which will greatly increase the chances of knocking varren off their feet. Remember to use your storm ability to run quickly away from groups of varren when needed.
When the varren are finally down, move across the room and to the door to the facility.
A krogan arguing about procedure
When you start to climb the stairs you hear a Krogan Commander yelling at a ""stupid machine"". You can stand for a second and hear the krogan get more frustrated but eventually when you get up far enough a cutscene will play showing an ExoGeni VI dismissing the krogan and revealing your presence. The Krogan Commander turns and fights you.
Considering that he has a shotgun and krogan are good at close quarters fighting, you do have a fight on your hands, especially because he loves to go after Shepard. As always, keeping krogan off-balance with powers is standard procedure and here there's three of you versus just him. Spam him with bullets and abilities.
When the krogan falls, the VI automatically talks to you and it will remind you that discharging weapons on company property is forbidden. It welcomes you as Lizbeth, even if Shepard is male, because of her ID badge. You can ask the VI questions about the Krogan Commander's last query and Lizbeth. Apparently Lizbeth knew a lot more than she let on and also what ExoGeni was doing. The Thorian she was talking about is a plant-like creature that took over the colony, and ExoGeni allowed it to happen to study the results.
Now that you know more about what happened on Feros, it's time for the next mission: get out of ExoGeni HQ and head back to the colony. You'll try contacting Joker about the Thorian reveal, but there's a dropship attached to the building, and the field it's emitting must be blocking off the comms."

This mission is acquired in the Journal at the completion of two of the three plot missions on Noveria, Feros, or Therum. On accessing the Normandy's galaxy map in the aftermath of the second mission, the Citadel Council will request a priority holo-meeting in the ship's comm room to reveal the latest information on Saren's activities.
This is the overarching mission of Mass Effect and will update over the course of the game with the completion of additional plot worlds.
Race Against Time is a mission that doesn't relate to any specific point in the game. Rather, it is your ongoing mission to stop Saren Arterius' plans, and is completed by finishing the game.",
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Noveria:_Contamination,"Prerequisite: Noveria: Reactor Repair and Noveria: Reconnect Landlines
There are two ways to obtain this mission. One is by simply taking the elevator to the trams after gaining access to the tram station. Mira blasts out her regular user alert notice, though this time it's about the ""contaminants"" in the tramway decontamination chamber. The tram station has been sealed to keep these contaminants from escaping the facility.
The other is by talking to a Mira terminal after fixing the reactor and landlines. After inquiring about ""loose contaminants"", you must either instruct Mira to override the lockdown and get you access, or ask how to activate the 5000-Kelvin failsafe plasma jets that should take care of these contaminants. Note:  Instructing Mira to override the lockdown also finishes the mission as it's acquired.","A full-fledged mini-mission just to kill two (maybe three) measly bugs? only in Mass Effect
Note:  If you told Mira to override the lockdown before going to the decontamination and transit hub, she erroneously states ""no hazardous or unauthorized materials detected"" on the elevator ride up despite you having yet to deal with the issue.
When you arrive outside the decontamination chamber, you may see that the tunnel ahead is filled with rachni, specifically two Rachni Soldiers. Your squadmates comment on the situation, pointing out that the door control can be unlocked (Average Decryption). Inside the decon chamber office, there's a dead salarian next to a computer console, a lootable crate and junk bin, a Mira terminal, and an interface to repair the plasma incinerator (Hard Electronics). The computer console tells the salarian's final garbled log before he killed himself, and your squadmates again may have some comments afterward.
You have three options:
Repair the plasma vents and watch the bugs burn
Have Mira open the door and shoot them
Bypass the door and then shoot them
Sometimes the easiest way is the most spectacular
All of these options result in mission completion, if you haven't told Mira to override before going here. Ironically, the one that gives the most XP is the easiest for once: if your Electronics skill is sufficient (nine or above) repair the vents and watch the bugs burn. Dealing with the bugs manually as a result of bypassing the door or telling Mira to override has inferior per creature XP gains, though the credit payout is the same.
After dealing with the Rachni Soldiers in whatever way, inspect the decon chamber office and be wary of the grate next to the dead salarian. Another Rachni Soldier may pop up from there. Take it down then head into the tunnel. There's a bunch of Rachni Workers waiting in the next door, though technically they aren't part of this mission."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Noveria:_The_Hot_Labs,"Prerequisite: Noveria: Matriarch Benezia
Talk to the VI Mira about the neutron purge in the Hot Labs. Alternatively, Yaroslev Tartakovsky's death will cause the mission to appear in the journal.","The wounded Yaroslev Tartakovsky
From the tram station, head into the left elevator. The hot labs only have one occupant: Yaroslev Tartakovsky. Talk with him to learn what happened in the labs. He will give the complete history of the Rachni Project. He says that the rachni in the labs are beyond saving and you must activate the neutron purge to kill them all. If you're looking for Benezia, he tells you he hasn't seen her. Depending on your dialogue choices some of your squadmates may interject in the conversation.
At the end you have the option of either talking him into giving you the purge codes immediately, or break off and talk to Mira in the room behind him for status reports. Whichever order you do so is of no consequence.
Сука блять!
Ask Yaroslev about initiating the neutron purge and he will go over the arming procedure. Before he can finish, a giant claw pierces his chest, making a bloody mess. A Rachni Soldier out of nowhere flings him across the room and now you have to kill it.
Retrieve the code from Tartakovsky's corpse and head into the next room. BEFORE you initiate the purge, save your game because you will soon have a lot of rachni between you and the exit once you do. Equip everyone with their best anti-rachni gear. Activate the purge by giving Mira the code and now you have 120 seconds (two minutes) to get out--which won't be easy.
Being chased by giant acid-spitting bugs is probably in a thrill-seeker's bucket list somewhere
Rachni Soldiers and Workers have filled the main room and they will not let you go easily. Although your radar shows a crapton of red lifesigns, the actual number of rachni in the room is limited. There are 9 soldiers and 6 workers total: there are an initial 3 soldiers in the room, with more tunneling out from below upon approach or upon a soldier's death. Every time a soldier busts out of a grate a worker spawns alongside it. Kill them all for maximum experience (you should have plenty of time even in Insanity difficulty), or you can forego the potential gains and just run through.
If you want to race out, Immunity is nearly a must-have; otherwise, you will likely need to thin the herd at least a little. A fairly easy route is to follow one of the walls closely as the rachni are basically in the middle of the room. You cannot walk directly onto the grates, so you need to slip around them, then race for the exit. As always, crowd control talents like Singularity are welcome here whether you're going for full extermination or just trying to run the gauntlet. Grenade spamming is also viable, given the time pressure and enclosed space. One last word of warning: remember that even with Immunity active, rachni melee attacks can be forceful enough to knock you to the ground, which can spell your doom if the ability wears off or if the timer is running out.
When you hit the button inside the elevator, your squad revives and rejoins you, as with any other elevator. As the elevator rises, you hear a series of blasts. The mission is marked complete upon accomplishment or if you choose to leave Rift Station after concluding the main Noveria story."

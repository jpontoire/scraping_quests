Ex-Factor,Romances,"A few days after helping Judy Álvarez out after Evelyn Parker's suicide, V is contacted by Judy again, and tells them that she has come up with a plan to take revenge on what happened to Evelyn. She tells V that Lizzie's Bar used to be a joyhouse before the Mox took over control, and she plans to do the same with the Tyger Claws owned Clouds in Megabuilding H8. In order to realize this plan, she is eyeing the help from an insider at Clouds, and also also asks V if they are interested in helping her.
If V agrees to help Judy:
V tells Judy that they want to help her, to her relief. She tells V that she first have to get Maiko Maeda—Clouds Manager—on-board with their plan, and if that doesn't work out, they might as well give up. In order to meet with Maiko, Judy proposes that she and V meet up at the balcony by Clouds early in the morning.
Having made their way to the balcony on the 12th floor of the Megabuilding, V waits for Judy's arrival in the early morning. Before breaking into Maiko's office, Judy asks that V lets her do the talking, as they are more accustomed to Maiko's characteristics. She plans on telling Maiko the truth about what happened to Evelyn, hoping that it will be enough to get her on their side. Judy proceeds to open the door by hacking the security systems in a nearby maintenance panel.
Once inside, Judy and V talk with Maiko and explain their plan to take over Clouds from the inside to Maiko, as well as inform her about the heinous acts Woodman performed to Evelyn. Despite what Judy and V tell her, they are unable to bring Maiko on their team.

Once outside the building, V asks if Maiko and Judy have a history. Judy will proceed to talk about how the two used to be romantically involved, but that it was mainly because Judy was feeling lonely.
After the elevator ride to the ground floor, Judy will tell V that she plans on recruiting some former dolls that worked at clouds, and that she will need to gather more important information to appeal to Maiko.

With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends,Romances,"Some time after helping Panam Palmer rescue the Aldecaldos's leader, Saul Bright, she contacts V again, this time to ask if they are able to come to the Mobile Camp in Rocky Ridge as soon as possible.[N 1][N 2]
After V arrives at the Mobile Camp, they meet with Panam, Mitch, and Saul in the communications trailer. As V approaches them, Panam receives an earful from Saul Bright for calling them over to the camp, and tells Panam once more that he forbade her from even thinking about the Militech convoy that they heard about. Mitch also joins into the argument, calling Saul a fool for letting a Militech Basilisk slip through their fingers. Saul retorts by mentioning that it could mess up the job they came here to do, which is revealed to be a crop protection contract for Biotechnica, with whom he is meeting later.
Panam reveals that they plan on assaulting a Militech convoy that they have heard about in order to obtain a Basilisk from them, which could prove useful for the Aldecaldos, as it could restore some of their reputation as since taking on the Biotechnica contracts they have been going through a rough time. When V asks how they can help out, Panam suggests that they talk to the others–Bob Sagan, Cassidy Righter, Carol Emeka and Teddy Simos–first and walk over to them near the food truck.
After taking a seat, Panam starts explaining the plan to everyone. Panam explains that the Basilisk will be transported on two trucks on Highway 101, and she plans to block the convoy's path by occupying the railroad intersection that crosses the highway.
If V declines to help Panam:
V tells Panam that they don't want to get involved in such a risky job. Despite V declining, the Aldecaldos will continue their plan to try and take over the convoy, and ride off in their vehicles to the train station. Mitch tells V that if they change their mind, they can join them there.
If V decides to join the Aldecaldos at the train station:
V changed their mind and met up with the Aldecaldos at the train station.[N 3]
If V decides to tell Saul[N 4]:
Instead of meeting with the Aldecaldos at the train station, V opted to talk to Saul. V tells them that Panam and co. went on to execute their plan to try and take over the convoy. For their honesty, Saul awards V with 42940 eurodollars.
A few hours later, V is called by an angry Panam, asking them how they could rat her out to Saul, and breaks off contact with V.
A few days later, Saul sends V a text message telling them that they did the right thing by informing him about her plan, and that the entire family owes them a huge debt of gratitude. Saul adds that the contract with Biotechnica did not work out and that the Aldecaldos will be moving their camp soon, with Panam, Mitch and the other veterans already having gone ahead of them. As a parting gift, Saul tells V that they left them something at the Sunset Motel.[N 5]
If V agrees to help Panam:
V agrees to help Panam and goes to the Corp-Bud Railroad Station.
If V decides to travel with Panam:
While driving to the train station with Panam, V talks with her. She notes that Saul probably is in favor of them not being at the Mobile Camp, considering that Biotechnica will be dropping by for a visit. Panam also mentions that Saul is afraid that the Raffen Shiv will attack the Aldecaldos as retaliation for taking the Biotechnica contract from them, and has posted extra security around the camp. When V asks if she misses Night City, she will tell V that she misses the excitement but that she at the same time misses the emptiness of the Badlands. V can understand some of this sentiment and tells Panam about Jackie Welles.
Once the Aldecaldos arrive at the train station and exit their vehicles, they go once more over the plan, and note that all that is necessary to put their plan in motion is to get the old freight train working again. Carol explains that in order to get the train operating, Panam and V will need to override authorization in the control tower.[N 6]
V helps Panam find the entrance to the control tower,[N 7] and together they make their way up to the control room.
Once up high in the tower, Carol tells Panam and V that they have to look for a punch card somewhere in the building in order to gain access to the locomotive's control panel. After finding the Punchcard in a cabinet, V returns to Panam to tell them they have found it, and Carol will instruct them to enter the card into the control panel's reader. After entering the card into the control panel, the locomotive will activate and start moving. Panam will have a heart-to-heart conversation with V, and asks them why they've decided to help her out.[N 8]
After talking with each other, Panam and V join the other Aldecaldos at the campfire near the junction. [N 9] The nomads talk with each other about their current situation and Scorpion, before going to bed.[N 10][N 11]
In the morning, Panam will wake up V and tells them to get in her vehicle, as the Aldecaldos are preparing to start their assault on the Militech convoy. After getting in the vehicle, the Aldecaldos and V ride alongside the locomotive to the railroad crossing on Highway 101 and intercept the convoy. After a firefight, the Aldecaldos manage to secure the Basilisk and escort the trucks back to the camp.[N 12]
Back in the camp, Panam is welcomed by an infuriated Saul, who give each other an earful. Afterwards, Panam instructs the other nomads to get to work on the Basilisk and talks with V, and tells them she will give them a call when she needs more help from them.[N 13]","Talk to Panam.

"Both_Sides,_Now",Romances,"After meeting with the Voodoo Boys, V is contacted by Judy Álvarez, who asks them to come over as soon as possible.[N 1]
As V arrives at the apartment building on Charter street in Northside, Watson, they enter her apartment, and get immediately called over to the bathroom by Judy.
Inside the bathroom, V is encountered with a gruesome scene. Judy's friend and your former client, Evelyn Parker, committed suicide. Judy explains that she was away at the time when it happened, and is unable to forgive herself for leaving the apartment. Wanting to go through the proper channels, Judy calls the NCPD to report the incident, and asks that V carries Evelyn's body to the bedroom.
While V carries Evelyn's body to the bedroom, Judy is giving the NCPD an earful, as they appear to not have the time to come over to the apartment and investigate the suicide. After hanging up, Judy joins V in the bedroom and asks that V leaves the room while she takes care of her friend.
Moment pass, and Judy and V find themselves on the roof of the apartment building, passing the time. Judy asks V for a cigarette, which they take from Evelyn's cigarette case. Visibly emotional, Judy tells V that they can keep the cigarette case, as she thinks they like having it.
Judy will note to V that Fingers, the ripperdoc they met with earlier, had Evelyn for four days, and will also note that she talked with Tom Caldera from Clouds, who has told her that Evelyn had been missing from the place for a full week. Unable to sleep because she didn't know what happened to Evelyn during those three missing days, she dug deeper in the virtus she recovered from Evelyn's recording implant, trying to uncover more information. Judy was able to find out that Oswald Forrest, the manager of Clouds, kept her for those three days and had his way with her, before selling her off to the Scavengers.
Unsure with how to proceed, Judy asks that V leaves them alone for now so they can think on how to proceed, and promises to stay in touch with V.[N 2]","Go to Judy's apartment.

Pyramid_Song,Romances,"To unlock this side quest, do not side with Maiko or don't take her money in Pisces:
Some time after the events at Clouds, Judy calls V to meet her at an abandoned shack near Laguna Bend Reservoir at sunrise.
Once V arrives, Judy explains what she wants to do here. She tells V that she wants to go diving in the lake where the shack is located, and record a braindance of them doing so. V agrees to do so, and puts on a diving suit. After V puts on a braindance scroller, which links their brains, they dive into the lake together. While in the water, V calibrates their suit by swimming around Judy, then swimming backwards, then finally letting her hum a song to check auditory responses.
Once calibrated, Judy and V use a pole to dive down to Laguna Bend, Judy's old hometown that has since been flooded. Judy will talk about the different locations they come across, while V has the opportunity to locate and scan a few objects, with memories of Judy's childhood playing in their head throughout. They first come across a restaurant and her home, in which V can scan and talk about the restaurant's sign, an old photo, and a hockey stick. V can also pick up and give Judy an old camera nearby. They then come across a gas station, in which V can scan and talk about an umbrella, a doll, and an abandoned car.
After moving on from the gas station, they come across a church. V must find a way into the church. After finding a way inside the church, Judy begins talking about her memories near the altar. While she is doing so, V's relic malfunctions, causing them to pass out.
V wakes up on the dock to Judy performing CPR on V, and Judy is relieved when V wakes up. She then offers for V to stay the night at the house. V goes into the house with Judy afterwards. Soon after, V must go outside to start the generator to power the house. While outside, V will hear Judy's memories of Evelyn Parker. When V returns, Judy will have gone to the bathroom. V enters to check in on her, and Judy talks about what happened as a result of the raid on Clouds.
If V is female and chooses to romance Judy:
V gets affectionate with Judy. Judy takes V to the bedroom, and they have sex on the bed. V wakes up in the morning with Judy beside them, although she gets out of the bed before V wakes up.
After V dresses, she meets Judy sitting on the dock. Judy asks V what they think their day prior meant to V.
If V chooses ""A pleasant distraction"":
Judy becomes upset, and she will immediately leave not just the area, but Night City as a whole, and delete V from her contacts.
If V chooses any other option:
Judy and V form a couple, causing Judy to stay in Night City. She gives V access to her apartment through personal link, allowing them to visit at any time.
If V is male or chooses not to kiss Judy:
Judy goes to bed once they finish talking in the bathroom.
If V goes to bed instead of leaving:

Riders_on_the_Storm,Romances,"Some time after nabbing Anders Hellman from Kang Tao, a distressed Panam Palmer calls V with a request to come meet with her at the Aldecaldo Camp in Rocky Ridge.
Upon asking her what happened, she tells V that Saul Bright was taken by a group of Wraiths while he and some others were out on patrol, and that they've been observing their camp in Sierra Sonora ever since. Panam asks for V's help in this matter, and promises to give them Mitch's Overwatch in turn.
After agreeing to help, Panam and V make their way to Mitch to get briefed, but instead only find Carol, Cassidy, Teddy, and Bob. Carol tells Panam that Mitch will be back shortly. As V leans on the car, Panam proposes a stealth plan where V sneaks into the Wraiths Camp, while she provides cover from a vantage point. They finish wrapping up the plan as Mitch returns, interrupting the bickering going on between the Aldecaldos.
Mitch proposes that V takes a look at the Wraiths Camp themselves using the drone that Mitch sent flying overhead. Using the drone, V observes the camps gate and perimeter, identifying the camps defenses. While observing, Panam asks V to inspect the tire tracks and the truck, before asking them to inspect the main building where Saul is most likely being kept. Having gathered enough intel, V disconnects from the drone.
Mitch, Panam, and V walk towards Villefort Columbus, in which they plan to approach the camp, but before setting off, Mitch advises that V take a SuperJet with them for when they find Saul. It should help with leading him out of the compound safely.
Upon closing up to the camp, Panam will mention an incoming dust storm, indicating that they have to move quickly if their plan is to succeed. After arriving at the camp and parking the van in a safe spot, V infiltrates the main camp and is able to find Saul in the basement if the main building.
If V took the stealth approach:
Upon exiting the camp with Saul safely, the trio rode off in the van to safety at the Ingalls' Farm, where they spend the night to recover and avoid the dust storm.
If V took the loud approach:
Upon exiting the camp with Saul, the trio rode off in the van chased by Wraiths, which they had to fend off. Due to the dust storm, they managed to reach the Ingalls' Farm safely, where they spend the night to recover.

Some time after receiving Judy Álvarez's message thanking them for being a good friend and agreeing to help her free Clouds, V receives a phone call from Judy, telling them that she finally heard back from Maiko Maeda, and that she is gathering with the others–Tom Caldera and Roxanne Sumner–at Megabuilding H8.
Once V joins them at the Megabuilding, the group reiterates the plan before taking the elevator to the maintenance level, where Judy and V disembark to take control over the level, while Tom and Roxanne continue on to level 8 where Clouds is located.
To gain control over the level, Judy tells V that she needs to gain access to the control panel located on this floor, but that the Tyger Claws resistance in the area may make it difficult for them, and tasks them with taking out the Tyger Claws. After V has dispatched of the enemies, they regroup with Judy at the control panel. Judy informs V that she will not be coming with them to the penthouse, and that from here on out they are on their own until they meet with Maiko. Judy stays behind on the maintenance level to observe both V's situation as well as the situation in Clouds, and V takes the freight elevator to go to the roof of the Megabuilding.
Once on the rooftop, Judy instructs V to jump down onto the balcony of Hiromi's penthouse. Inside the penthouse, there are four more Tyger Claws that make it more difficult for V to gain access to Hiromi's office. After V dispatches them and opens the door to the office, V is greeted by Maiko, who was waiting for their arrival. Inside the room, Hiromi Sato is accompanied by Jun Azegami and Marcus Ichida, two other high-ranking Tyger Claws bosses, and three dolls for pleasure. The three of them are engaged in a braindance, while V and Maiko talk.
When V questions Maiko about the unexpected presence of the two Tyger Claws, she reveals that she only went along with Judy's plan to arrange her own rise to power as Hiromi's replacement. The Tyger Claw bosses are there so Maiko can expose Hiromi's incompetence, gain their trust, and join the Tyger Claws herself. She is certain that without the protection of a gang, the dolls will be unable to hold onto Clouds by themselves and will be crushed. As Maiko prepares to jack the men out, V must decide what to do next: either side with Maiko in her negotiation with the bosses, or side with Judy and stick to the original plan to liberate the dolls.[N 1]
If V sides with Maiko and accepts her money:
V decides to side with Maiko and accept her bribe. Angered by their decision, Judy severs ties with V over the betrayal and leaves the city. It is later revealed that although Clouds no longer has a constant Tyger Claw presence with Maiko in charge, working conditions are just as bad under Maiko as they were under Woodman. Tom and Roxanne are unhappy with the situation, but continue working at Clouds.[N 2][N 3]
If V sides with Maiko and declines her money:
Judy is disappointed with being played but comes to terms with it, admitting that Maiko knows more about how to protect Clouds than she does. It is later revealed that although Clouds no longer has a constant Tyger Claw presence with Maiko in charge, working conditions are just as bad under Maiko as they were under Woodman. Tom and Roxanne are unhappy with the situation but continue working at Clouds.[N 4]
If V sides with Judy and kills Maiko:
Judy is shocked that Maiko is dead. V can argue that it was self-defense, and Maiko should have known better, but Judy insists that Maiko's death was unnecessary. Judy leaves, saying she needs time to process events. It is later revealed that the Tyger Claws retaliated against the dolls harshly and reclaimed Clouds. Tom is killed, Roxanne is forced into hiding, and Clouds is closed indefinitely.[N 5]
If V sides with Judy and Maiko is left alive:
Judy is pleased that V stopped Maiko's power grab and Clouds is now managed by the dolls.[N 5][N 6] Judy will mention that the Tyger Claws retaliated, resulting in Tom's death and Roxanne fleeing.
After the confrontation in Hiromi's office is settled, V must leave the apartment and take the elevator to the ground level to meet with Judy to discuss what happened.","Wait for Judy's call.

The_Hunt,Romances,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Rewrite from V perspective, rewrite notes into walkthrough as conditions]
Some time after completing I Fought the Law, River will call V, needing assistance and requests them to meet him in person to discuss the details.
After you get to the designated location and wait for him to arrive, he'll pull up in his truck. Get in and talk to him a bit but he's not really in a chatty mood and will instead send you a video clip to watch of a news reel. It'll reveal a man named Anthony Harris who's also the dubbed ""Peter Pan"" serial killer being apprehended in his car by NCPD as one of his victims falls out of the vehicle. Anthony tries to run but is shot down by police and the clip will note the victim died from septic shock. Meanwhile Anthony, while still alive, is comatose in a hospital so there's no way to interrogate him about where other victims are being held.
After it finishes, River will reveal while Peter Pan was never his case, his nephew, Randy, recently went missing and the victim in the video was wearing Randy's shoes. Furthermore, the detective that is on the case isn't doing much and so it's not looking good in finding Randy in time and River isn't on good terms with his sister so he doesn't know much about Randy's disappearance. But he does have an idea: to try and view Anthony's dreams as a braindance to see if enough clues can be found to find and save Randy.
NCPD Lab[]
With that, get out of the vehicle and follow River across the street to the lab, but he'll note he doesn't have access to get inside. Head to the left from the entrance to find an alleyway with a door with a leveled Technical Ability requirement. Alternatively, V can head to the right from the entrance to find a door with a leveled Body requirement. Alternatively, one can use a container to get over the wall next to the first door.
River will inform V that the place is empty, so the pair won't be disturbed. Head to the central area and enter the child's room to the side and scan the file cabinets here to locate Anthony's file. While searching them, V and River will be interrupted by Yawen Packard. After some back and forth where River will blackmail Yawen into helping. She will reveal that Anthony isn't dreaming, so they can't get any BDs off him. River will take it upon himself to find a way and heads out.
Go through the front door where Johnny will talk a bit and, if using a female V, he'll note River seems rather interested in V. Get in River's vehicle and he'll start driving out to his sister's place while you can talk to him about his suspension, Randy, and the case.
Visiting Joss[]
The pair will eventually arrive at Joss', who isn't happy either about seeing River but will agree to let him and V look through Randy's stuff if it means finding something that could help bring back her son. Follow River to the other trailer where Randy was living and look around for clues. In particular, to be successful in saving Randy in time, V will need enough major clues. Some of these clues include:
In the kitchen area pick up the key on the shelf near the table and use it to unlock the cabinet in Randy's bedroom
Have enough Intelligence to hack Randy's computer (or scan the record player in the hallway to learn the password)
Read all the messages and files on the computer
On the ""Net"" tab click the image of the red people to find the secret website, then on that site, click the ""Join Us"" then ""Files"" tabs, then back to the computer's main files to view the video again. River will then send this to Yawen to see if that gets Anthony dreaming
While it helps, it's not necessary to find Harris' IP address (high Intelligence required). To do so exit out like normal from the computer but this time one will have the option to tell him V can or lack the skills to do so. V can also find enough clues in the BDs to compensate for this if V does not enough Intelligence to find the IP.
After doing everything one can, follow River back over to Joss to talk to her about the findings. Agree to stay and V can talk a bit to Joss before heading to bed. River will wake them up some time later with good news: the video worked, and Anthony is dreaming. One will now need to scroll the BDs they got for additional clues:
School
3 visuals: the teacher, the bulletin boards, and the trophy case
Childhood Barn
7 Visuals: Young Anthony, the cow, Anthony's father, the console to the left of Anthony's father, the injection system console Anthony passes, the dietary supplements across the barn, and the cartoon playing
Note if one found enough clues in this one, V may not be able to scan the last one (the optional objective to find clues may disappear if this is the case)
Adulthood Barn
13 Visuals: Solar box, clock, electrical parts, fuel barrels, victims x3, infusion pump, FDNC certificate, computer, crawling victim, number to top left of barn entrance, towers of light (outside the barn)
Audio: AV sounds (through the ceiling)
If V found enough clues, River will deduce the correct location is Edgewood Farm, or if one has already travelled to the farm before, V will recognise it if they scan the towers of light. Otherwise, one will need to guess, though it is in the list of guessing options so V can select it there if they didn't get enough clues. That said, if V guesses the wrong farm, Randy won't be found in time. Romance note: If one wishes to romance River, they need to make sure to pick the right farm here, otherwise it'll lock River's last quest out and he won't be able to be romanced.
Finding Randy[]
Edgewood Farm doesn't have any enemies, but the yard is littered with mines, along with four turrets and several cameras. In addition, leaving the area will result in both River and Randy dying (as River will be killed from the barn's defenses and nobody else will arrive in time to save Randy).
If one does not or cannot turn off the defenses individually, the house nearby contains a desk with a switch underneath. Pressing it to reveals a hidden room with a second computer that will turn off the turrets and cameras. The Tinker Bell can be found nearby as well. If done, V will only need to worry about the mines as they make their way to the left of the barn entrance where a ladder is located. Use it to get up on the roof and enter through an opening here. River will find Randy but needs V to turn off the BD machine in the control room before he can unplug Randy. After doing so, head back around to help the other three victims (two will still be alive). Afterwards, River will call for V for their assistance, so go help him out and then it'll fast forward to where the police have arrived and working on getting the victims to the hospital. River though still has one more agenda: Anthony has to die. Romance note: Do not select the ""count me out"" option here if one wishes to romance him. After some more dialogue, River will part with the Trauma Team, ending the quest.","Meet with River Ward in the evening.

Off_the_Leash_(quest),Romances,"V gets a call from Kerry Eurodyne, who invites them to the Dark Matter—an exclusive club in Japantown. When V arrives at the entrance, there is a bouncer blocking the elevator's door, claiming that it is ""out of order"". V tells the bouncer that he is Kerry Eurodyne's guest and the bouncer grants them access.
If Kerry forced Us Cracks to comply during the events of I Don't Wanna Hear It:
During the phone call with Kerry, V learns that Us Cracks has reneged on their promise to not perform a cover version of Kerry Eurodyne’s song User Friendly and that the band is seeking a restraining order against Eurodyne.
The Dark Matter is all but empty, and Kerry mentions that he closed the club.
If Kerry and Us Cracks amicably came to an agreement during the events of I Don't Wanna Hear It:
As V enters the lounge, a promotional event is in full swing. In the scene, packed with fans and journalists, there is initially an anime video about Us Cracks and Kerry displaying on the screen. After the screen raises, Us Cracks and Kerry appear on stage and announce that they are collaborating on a new single. A reporter says that Kerry is ""on top of his game"" and asks Kerry how the collaboration came to be, to which Kerry replies that rock is once more evolving, adding that Us cracks are ""energizing"" and ""electrifying"" and wanted to work on a new song with Kerry. The reporter notes that Kerry's depression is a thing of the past and Kerry denies that he was ever depressed or thought about retiring. Likewise, Us Cracks are full of praise for Kerry, and Blue Moon says that meeting Kerry was ""Doki doki. Love at first sight"".
V can approach them by walking through the room among the fans. Kerry will beckon V to come. After V goes there, Kerry lays his arm on V's shoulder and introduces V to the journalists as his ""right hand"". One of them will ask V what it is like to hang out with Kerry Eurodyne, and V can choose whether to answer. Then Kerry will ask V to leave the scene with him. Before V leaves, they can talk to Us Cracks about the event.[Notes 1]
Kerry introduces V to Spector Cheng, who promises Kerry to give V a ""friends and family"" discount. Kerry then leads V to the balcony on the building. V and Kerry will talk about his life and career. If V chooses to hear Kerry out, Kerry will eventually admit that he hasn’t been honest with V regarding the Us Cracks situation. Kerry reveals that the real reason why he was uncomfortable with Us Cracks performing a cover version of one of his songs was not that Kerry was afraid of becoming a puppet for corporations. What Kerry really was afraid of was being in someone else’s shadow again just like he had been in Johnny Silverhand's shadow during the Samurai years.
If V has a masculine body and voice:
V is able to kiss Kerry Eurodyne and start a romance event. After kissing, Kerry Eurodyne will stay at the rooftop a little while longer to think.
If V has a feminine body:

Kerry was tipped off about a van transporting the group's gear to Night City, and he wants to blow it up before it gets there.
Kerry and V drive to the Red Peaks in the Badlands, on the edge of the city, and stop at a bus stop. Kerry instructs V to get equipment out of the trunk and follow him to lay out the stinger for the van. After they hide at the bus stop, the van runs over the stinger and stops, and Kerry and V force the occupants out of the van. They cooperate and give them the access card to the van, and after V opens the van's rear doors, they let the occupants go.
Once the occupants are set free, V blows up the van using a grenade. After they and Kerry talk more, NCPD sirens are heard in the distance. Kerry and V get into their car and try to escape from the police.

Queen_of_the_Highway,Romances,"A day after helping Panam Palmer and the veteran Aldecaldos seize the Basilisk from Militech, V is contacted by Panam, telling them that they have completed the assembly of the panzer vehicle, and ask V if they want to drive it.
After accepting Panam's invite, V heads back to the Mobile Camp in Rocky Ridge to meet with her and the other Aldecaldos. Upon approaching them, they tell V that they're still finalizing a few little things, such as the panzer's Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics. Cassidy tells V that they left the Militech trucks at a nearby Raffen Shiv camp so that the corporation would start looking at them instead of the Aldecaldos. Upon telling them that they always dreamed of driving one of them, Panam tells V that they can climb inside the panzer.[N 1]
As V climbs inside the panzer, Panam joins them in the other seat and starts up the Basilisk, which does not go smoothly. After starting the machine, Panam ask V what they think about the machine, and explains that while connected to the vehicle's systems, it in essence becomes an extension of the body. As Panam pilots the vehicle out of the camp for a test run, she explains V that a co-pilot is needed to handle the sensory overload, which is why the pilot takes care of the vehicles movement and the co-pilot takes care of the vehicle weapon systems.[T 2]
Once far enough away from the camp, Panam disconnects from the vehicle, and instructs V to jack-in themselves and pilot for a short distance before asking them to maneuver through the Wind Farms. After piloting past several wind turbines, Panam tells V that it is time for some target practice, and asks that they take the five targets in the area.
After the target practice, Panam tells V that she will also be connecting to the vehicle. After she connects, V experiences strange feelings and asks Panam what happens. She explains that, while both jacked-in, the pilot and co-pilot's systems become intertwined.
If V romanced Panam:
Panam asks V if they want to ""try it out,"" which they accept, and a romantic scene will engage.
Suddenly, Panam and V are attacked and surrounded by the Raffen Shiv, and have to defeat them. Saul Bright contacts them over the radio, informing them that the Raffen Shiv have also started assaulting the camp, and instructs them to return to help.[N 2]
After defeating the Raffen Shiv, Panam and V park and exit the Basilisk, and proceed to meet with Saul. Saul tells Panam that she's been making the right decisions for the Aldecaldos family, and asks her that she leads them alongside him. He admits to Panam that he was wrong about her actions before, and proceeds to hug her. After hugging, Panam exclaims that things have to change in order for her to accept her new position, to which Saul responds that the first thing they have to do is find a new location for their camp before Militech and more Wraiths find them. The rest of the Aldecaldos congratulate Panam, before she asks that V follows her.
While walking, Panam and V reflect back on their adventure so far, and Panam tells V that it is mostly because of them that they've made it this far, and that if they were ever in the need of the Aldecaldos's help, they would have it. Upon arriving at the camp's bar, she will ask V what type of drink they'd like, and talk more with each other. While talking, Panam asks that V stay with the Aldecaldos, which V isn't sure about because of the situation they are in. As V turns away from the bar, they suffer from another Relic malfunction and drop to the floor.
Some time passes, and V is woken up by Panam inside a tent. Panam explains to V that while they were passed out, the Aldecaldos moved camp to a safer place. Panam proceeds to ask V what is happening to them, to which V will explain the unique situation they are in. After talking, V gets up and is met by Mitch and Saul, also asking V what happened.
After talking with them, Panam escorts V out of the camp back to their vehicle. While following Panam, she will tell V that the camp's new location is outside Militech's usual patrol areas and that they have a better tactical advantage due to the layout, but that despite that, they will soon have to move again.
Upon reaching V's vehicle, Panam will ask V how she can help them get better, to which they don't really have an answer but tell her that they will let her know if they do find more information.[N 3]","Leave the camp and wait for a day for the Basilisk to be ready.

Talkin%27_%27bout_a_Revolution,Romances,"About a day after Judy Álvarez and V met with Maiko Maeda at Clouds, Judy will text V that she is still working on a plan and that it will probably take a couple more days to finalize the details.
After some time passes, Judy will call V and tell them that she's devised a plan to take over Clouds, and invites V over to her apartment in the evening to discuss the plan in detail, with Tom Caldera and Roxanne Sumner–two dolls that work at Clouds, and Maiko Maeda, whom she managed to convince. She also asks V what they would prefer to have on their pizza. V, curious about this secret plan of Judy, asks her if she is privy to share more details now, to which Judy reveals that she managed to tweak the doll behavioral chips and how to turn them into fighter chips, but will go into more detail during the meeting.
After arriving at the apartment building on Charters street in Northside, V uses the intercom to let Judy know that they are there. V is promptly greeted by Tom, who tells them that their pizza is getting cold. As V enters and follows Tom to the kitchen, Judy greets V and introduces them to Roxanne, and tells them that she is one of the longest working dolls at Clouds. V sits down on the stool and talks with the others until Maiko–who apparently was in the bathroom–comes out to join in and makes a snide remark about the fact that Evelyn died in Judy's bathroom.
If V talks with Maiko Maeda and has killed Woodman:
This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝
V talks with Maiko before talking with Judy. Maiko questions V about what happened to Oswald Forrest as he hasn't been to work in a few days, which V will happily explain to her.
V asks Judy what the plan is about, which Judy will explain in detail. She managed to modify the doll behavioral chips, and equip them with an advanced motor reflex system, that gives the doll enhanced combat abilities that could match a Solo. Judy will inform V that Tom already has the modified doll chip, and the chip's impulses replace ones natural reflexes, and makes the user feel like as if they were experiencing cyberpsychosis. Tom adds that it is basically the same as if he would activate his behavioral chip for a client.
If V has high enough Reflexes:
V asks about the possible side-effects of the behavioral chip, which Judy answers with that once a threat has been detected, the chip will automatically activate, and that she currently has not found a workaround for it, as it would require months of testing, which is time she doesn't have. Roxanne adds that there is an ethical side to the use of the chip, as you could murder someone and not remember doing so.
If V has high enough Body:
V tells them that being a Solo requires more than just executing a series of movements, and that it requires years of experience in the field to become a good Solo. Judy says that V is probably right, but that they do not have the time for years of intensive training.
If V asks Judy how she came up with the idea:
Judy explains that she learned how to adjust behavioral chips while she was working at Clouds, and given that how easy it was, the idea didn't jump into her mind as soon as they met with Maiko earlier. Maiko adds that due to all the surveillance at Clouds, this would probably never have happened during Judy's time there, as the Tyger Claws would have taken measures to prevent it from happening.
V wants to see how the modified behavioral chip works, asks for a demonstration. Tom will proceed to throw three kitchen knives at the wall in rapid succession. Unconvinced by Tom's display, V proceeds to ask for a one-on-one sparring duel with Tom, who proceeds to grab V arm and pushes them on Judy's couch.[N 1]
As V lands on the couch, Judy rushes over to them to make sure they are okay. Judy tells V that after they've taken over Clouds successfully, the chips will get neutralized so that they cannot be used again.[N 2]
Judy then reveals once they take over Clouds, the bosses will be given an ultimatum to take a cut of the proceeds to never show up at the club again, giving the dolls control of the place, but Maiko points out an obvious flaw: the Tyger Claws will just send more security in to regain control. She instead tells V that they need to go after Hiromi Sato–Clouds real owner–and humiliate him in front of the rest of the gang's bosses to remove him. Maiko will then suggest that they instead follow a two-pronged assault strategy, with Tom and Roxanne infiltrating the joyhouse and V infiltrating Hiromi's apartment.
If V decides to go forward with the plan:
V agrees to go forward with the plan. Maiko leaves with Tom and Roxanne in tow, whom ask her for a ride. V stays a little while longer at Judy's place to talk a little bit longer with Judy to discuss pay. As V stands up, they suffer another Relic malfunction, and sit back on Judy's couch with her help.
If V decides to tell Judy about the Relic:
V tells Judy about the Relic and what it is doing to them, and that they can only hope to find a cure.
Judy offers V to stay at her place for a little while longer, so that they can recover.

She tells V that she needs help with some street races, and is looking for a driver, and since V is a reliable mercenary, she approached them. She asks that V meet with her in her garage on Valley street[B 1] in Arroyo, Santo Domingo during the day.[N 1]
As V enters the garage, they can hear Claire mumbling to herself about her car. She will slide out from under the vehicle, which she introduces to V as ""Beast."" As V asks about the race rules, Claire tells them that there aren't really any, other than that you race in pairs; a driver and a gunner. She tells V that she is more of a gearhead and a shooter than a driver, and that is why she needs one.
When V asks if she has raced before, Claire answers that she has, but that her previous driver passed away during a race a year ago.
If V agrees to become Claire's driver:
V accepts Claire's offer to be her driver during the street races. Claire says that there will be four races in total, and that the first one will start in the City Center district, followed by a race in the Badlands, then Santo Domingo, and a final round in Westbrook. When asked about a payout, Claire tells V that first place will receive some prize money, that they'll split equally. She will also tell V that the decision about which vehicle they will enter with is up to V.
As a final bit of information, she informs V that in order to qualify for the Watson final, they will have to qualify in the top three in at least two of the races. She asks V to wait for her call and meet her at the first race in City Center.
If V refuses to become Claire's driver:
V declines Claire's offer to be her driver during the street races–despite her efforts to convince them–and forfeits the job.[N 2]

During the final race, Peter Sampson will split off after his vehicle has mechanical issues. Claire wants V to follow him off the highway.
If V follows Sampson as he exits the highway:
After following Sampson off the highway, V and Claire witness Sampson collide with another car, and get out of their vehicle. Claire rushes over to Sampson, and starts to mock him for his current situation as he tries to crawl out from under his wrecked vehicle.
Sampson, begging for Claire to spare his life, claims that he didn't kill Dean, but that he got himself killed.
If V wants to hear what Sampson has to say:
V tells Claire that they want to hear what Sampson has to say. Sampson will tell them that Dean tried to pass him just before the finish line, but that he lost control of the car when Sampson rammed him, which is according to him not against the rules of the race.

Sinnerman,Story_Characters,"Some time after capturing Anders Hellman, V is contacted by Wakako Okada. Wakako offered V a job from one of her more demanding clients, Bill Jablonsky. Jablonsky wants to exact revenge for the murder of his wife, Caroline Jablonsky. The client wants everything to go exactly as planned, and is willing to pay V handsomely in return.
Wakako instructs V to meet with the client on at the Dewdrop Inn on the corner of Sixth and Brandon street in Arroyo, Santo Domingo.[N 1] She also informs V that the client wants to be present when his wife's murderer is neutralized by the mercenary.
After making their way to the meeting location, V waits for Jablonsky's arrival. V gets up from the bench and approached Bill, and talks to them. During the conversation, Bill reveals to V that he wants them to kill Joshua Stephenson, a notorious murderer, and instructs V to get in the driver's seat of his truck.
Inside the truck, Bill tells V that Stephenson is the one who murdered his wife, and that despite his conviction, he managed to get out of jail due to corporate involvement.[N 2] He also tells V that Stephenson is being transported out of the Night City Prison and is accompanied by other ""regular"" individuals. As the NCPD SUV passes by, Jablonsky instructs V to follow the SUV.[N 3]
If V successfully followed the SUV:
Despite the traffic hurdles, V and Jablonsky managed to follow the van transporting Stephenson up-to an underpass, where the van ran into a stationary semi-truck. After stopping the truck, Jablonsky and V both get out. Jablonsky–overcome with anger and his desire to kill Stephenson himself–pulls out his pistol and rushes over to the SUV but is shot by NCPD Lieutenant Vasquez.
If V talks to Joshua Stephenson:
After Vasquez shoots Bill, Stephenson urges Vasquez to keep V alive, and threatens to kill the deal with the corporation if V is shot. As Vasquez stands down, he contacts the NCPD about the incident, and allows V to speak with Joshua Stephenson, who wants V to tag along with them.[N 4]
Stephenson will introduce himself to V, and ask their name and their associates name. As Vasquez concludes his call to the NCPD, he makes a remark about having heard of V, and urging to Stephenson that V is too big a threat to take along with them.
If V goes with Stephenson:
V accepts Joshua's invite and gets inside the NCPD SUV, and Vasquez will proceed to drive them to their destination while Joshua and V talk.[N 5]
If V declines to go with Stephenson:
V declines Joshua's invite to tag along with them. The three get back into the SUV and continue their journey, while V stayed behind, concluding the job.
If V neutralizes Joshua Stephenson:
After Jablonsky gets shot by Vasquez, V engaged Stephenson and neutralized them. Afterwards, V called Wakako Okada, and tells her that they were able to neutralize Joshua Stephenson. Wakako Okada rewarded V with a payment of 9,300 eurodollars for completing the job.[N 6][N 7]
If V fails to follow the SUV:
V failed to follow the van and bring Joshua Stephenson to justice, too much annoyance of Bill Jablonsky, he will proceed to terminate the gig and be angry with V, demanding they exit the vehicle. After a while, Bill will send V and angry text informing V that they will not be receiving any payment.","Talk to Wakako Okada.

After getting close enough, the divergent Delamain will call V, asking them if they can see them–flamingos–as well. The divergent Delamain asks V to call them ""Clarice,"" and wants V to destroy eight flamingos in the neighborhood before wanting to return home.[Trivia 1]
After V destroys the eight flamingos, they are called by the divergent Delamain again, and tell them to shut down, allowing Delamain to take control of the vehicle.

Johnny—using V's body—downs a large number of drinks before learning from Claire Russell where Cassius Ryder is. Cassius first asks Johnny which tattoo he wants, before giving him information on a man named Jeremiah Grayson, who works for Adam Smasher. He also provides the name of a night club dancer and his ex-girlfriend, Ruby Collins, who's known to be an associate of Grayson's. Johnny goes to the club where Ruby works, flirts with her, parties hard, fights with the bouncers, gets thrown out and finally leaves with Ruby in a stolen car. Things heat up between the two while Rudy's driving, distracting her and causing a car crash. They manage to get out of the wrecked car, and a wounded Ruby scribbles the name of Ebunike on a pack of Morley's before leaving.

I_Fought_the_Law,Story_Characters,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Add conditional statements. Rewrite from V's perspective where necessary]
At some point after Life During Wartime, V will receive a call from an Elizabeth Peralez, wife to mayoral candidate Jefferson Peralez. She doesn't wish to discuss anything over the holo so requests to meet in person.
Once V reaches the meeting point, they are instructed to enter the car so they can then talk more freely with the couple, who note their suspicions that they believe Night City's late mayor, Lucius Rhyne, was murdered rather than dying from heart complications. They then ask V to edit a braindance from an attempted attack on Rhyne shortly before his death to see if they are able to get any clues from it. V learns a few key pieces of evidence from it, namely that an NCPD detective by the name of River Ward showed up needing to talk with their security just before the attack and took out the would-be assailant Péter Horváth; that a place called the Red Queen's Race was mentioned; and that Weldon Holt, the deputy mayor, is running as the mayoral candidate now in Rhyne's place.
After discussing these details with Peralez, they'll then give V River's contact information to call the detective. Call River up who'll agree to meet with V to discuss the case at Chubby Buffalo's BBQ in The Glen. When V arrives, they'll find him talking with his fellow detective Harold Han, who sounds like he's told River more than once to stop digging into Rhyne's case and that even his superior has told River to let it go. River dismisses this and Han will leave so that V and River can talk.
Investigating Leads[]
This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝Reason: Needs more information
After a short conversation in the diner, V follows River to his vehicle and gets in to have a more private conversation where River reveals that he suspects that someone in the precinct let Péter Horváth loose, as he was apprehended earlier that day. The conversation eventually turns to how to find the Red Queen's Race and he'll gives V two possible leads to follow up on: check with one of his informants and check with Péter's employer.
At the store, the informant, Neil White, will run as soon as you use the Igor line, but River corners him before he can get very far in the alley. Neil will eventually reveal the location of the club, but also notes when asked they closed it shortly after Rhyne's death.
At the Cherry Blossom Market, V and River look for Christine Markov, Péter's employer in Japantown. They split off to ask the other vendors where she is and eventually V learns of her location via one of them or River will learn of it and text you. Regardless, head to the back left area of the market to find her.
Unfortunately, she won't be able to reveal much, only that Péter was always off his rocker and making erratic speeches about the late mayor before showing up one day with all the latest implants, having been sponsored by someone who ""finally saw his worth"". Follow River back to his vehicle to find some Tyger Claws poking around it, having recognized it as River's. You can choose to intervene or stay quiet here. If you stay quiet, they'll leave peacefully. If you intervene, one them asks how high you can jump. Jumping will get them to leave quietly, otherwise they become hostile. If things stayed quiet, or they were dealt with non-lethally, River will be pleased as it means less paperwork for him, and you will be able to go with him.
Once you've done both leads (or did the informant first) you can then head out to the club's location in Charter Hill.
Investigating the Club[]
As River is NCPD, he can't enter the premises without a warrant, so V has to go in alone here. V can try talking to the Animals member at the entrance gate, but she'll basically tells the place is closed and they're not allowed in, so they'll need to find another way in.
The club's entrance is hidden in one of the large shipping crates inside the warehouse. Open the crate's doors and head down using the elevator to enter the club where more Animals are roaming. The office and boss you're looking for is in the back, on the second floor and can easily be grabbed from behind in a chokehold to interrogate if you wish to go that route. If so, she'll reveal the Animals were hired to smash up the place and the only reason they're still hanging out is the one who hired them, Weldon Holt, still hasn't paid up. Once she's dealt with, you can check the computer where the messages confirm this. However, also check the files to see Ward's partner, Han, is also behind the coverup. River will then tell you to get out of there so you guys can confront Han but if you haven't already, go check the booth where Rhyne died to find the braindance wreath he had on. Interact with it and you'll pass out and River will break in to get to you. After a short conversation, you'll reveal what you learned from the wreath: someone spiked it and that's what killed Rhyne, not a heart attack. With that, you can choose to look around some more or leave with River, which will fast forward you to Chubby Buffalo's to confront Han.
Wrapping up the Case[]
River will ask who gave Han the orders to cover everything up, but Han won't say who and, with a few small conversations from you, Han will just note this is how Night City works and he's just doing his job in protecting his ""family"", that is the NCPD. This will allow River to deduce he knows who gave the order and he'll have to file it with Internal Affairs, but Han notes it won't do anything good, other than put River in their sights, before he drives off.
You can then talk to River about what he plans to do and eventually have the option to tell him to do it or not, but regardless what you say River is set on trying to re-open the case with the new information. With that, call Elizabeth and she'll ask you to visit their apartment to discuss it in person. When you get there though and start to head up in the elevator, Johnny will give some advice to not tell them anything, that whatever is going on is much deeper than they realize. However, you can choose to withhold the information or tell the couple what you learned, but regardless they'll be happy and conclude on their own what's going on and will pay you your fee.","Meet with Elizabeth Peralez.

Johnny will ask V to call Rogue and ask her out on his behalf, to try and make up for never taking her out properly in the past. As V calls Rogue, V asks her where she would want to go if the two went on a date, which she answers with the old drive-in movie theater named Silver Pixel Cloud in North Oak. V says they'll swing by the Afterlife to pick her up.
If the current time is not in the evening:
Rogue sends V a text message informing them that she is currently engaged with other things and asks that they come in evening.
V meets Rogue at the Afterlife during the evening, where she can be seen talking with Emmerick Bronson—who appears to be disappointed Rogue is going out on a date with V.
If V obtained the Porsche 911 Turbo (930):
Rogue asks V how they obtained the car and will remark on having a lot of memories in the car.[Notes 2]
Rogue and V get in the car and drive to the theater. During the ride, Rogue tells V that it was originally her idea to take Johnny to the movie theater, and that Johnny's idea of a romantic night out was raiding Arasaka Towers. After a while she will ask what Johnny's motive is, to which V will reply that Johnny has changed and is a more selfless person, and wants to make up for his past.
Arriving at the Silver Pixel Cloud, they discover that the place has been shut down and locked up. V searches around and finds a usable access code on the nearby terminal and is able to open the door.[Notes 3]
Inside the cinema premises, Rogue will walk over to a nearby car wreck, while V goes up a staircase to reach the projector room. When V starts up the projector, which will play Bushidō X: Fade to Black, they subsequently surrender control to Johnny by taking the Pseudoendotrizine.
Johnny heads down the stairs and sits next to Rogue on the car and reminisces about the past while they watch the movie. After a while, Johnny asks Rogue if this is how she'd imagine a date between them going, to which she replies that she'd always expected that some change was needed, just not to the current degree. She asks Johnny to pretend it is 2015, and asks if there is anything he would change since then.[Notes 4] Johnny answers her question, which causes her to become emotional and think about what ifs and all that.
If Johnny kisses Rogue:
A short romantic scene will play out between Rogue and Johnny, but Rogue interrupts it as it doesn't feel right. She confesses to Johnny that she is no longer the same person as she was before and that is just isn't going to work anymore. Rogue will promptly leave the drive-in theater, as Johnny gives back control to V by taking an Omega blocker.
If Johnny tells Rogue he doesn't have much to offer:
Johnny tells Rogue that he doesn't have much to offer right now, to which she replies that he has more to offer now than he did back then. Johnny admits that he messed up, and that he could have just been himself around her, without having to pretend or pose. Rogue responds to this by telling Johnny that it is too late now and that she's no longer the Rogue he knew back in 2015. She suggests that they just continue watching the movie, after which Rogue will leave, and Johnny will give back control to V by taking an Omega blocker.
After Rogue's departure, Johnny asks that V meet with Kerry Eurodyne.","Call Rogue and ask her out.

↑ The title of this job comes from the in-universe Samurai song ""Blistering Love.

↑ The vehicle is automatically called if it has been obtained during Chippin' In.

↑ The door authorization code is 0000.

↑ Rogue asking Johnny to pretend it is 2015 is likely an error or a test from Rogue, as Rogue and Johnny already had met at that time.

There_Is_A_Light_That_Never_Goes_Out,Story_Characters,"After getting in the NCPD SUV, Vasquez will drive Joshua Stephenson, Rachel Casich and V to their destination. While riding along, Joshua tells V that he was sentenced to prison twelve years ago for armed robbery amongst other things. He continues that he shot and killed several people in cold blood, but that it didn't do anything to him on the emotional level at the time. During his time in prison, he had the time to think about his actions, and thought of ways on how to correct them. Joshua asks that V sticks with him for the day, promising them payment equal to that they would have been paid for killing him. As they near their destination, Joshua will ask for a moment of time to think.[N 1]
Arriving at the El-Ahmar House, Joshua and V get out of the vehicle. As Joshua approaches the house, a woman named Zuleikha El-Ahmar greets and invites him and V in to talk. While speaking with Zuleikha, V learns that her brother, Ruben El-Ahmar, was killed by Joshua. But instead of despising Joshua for it, she began to write to him while he was in prison, forgiving him for what he did as her Christian faith told her to not judge others. Because of her letters, Joshua became a Christian himself.
Joshua will then reveal what's going on: Rachel is with a braindance recording studio that plans to record Joshua's crucifixion. Joshua hopes that this will inspire people to convert to Christianity by showing them how Jesus suffered for them. Before more can be said though, Zuleikha's mother Gloria arrives, and unlike her daughter, she hasn't forgiven Joshua and demands he and V leave.
If V decides to stay around:
Joshua and V return to the vehicle, and the group will decide to go for a meal, but Rachel would like a word in private with V first. She'll say that she thinks Joshua is nuts, but the fact that he genuinely believes what he says is valuable since it makes for better braindances. Rachel fears that V is jeopardizing this by asking ""probing questions"" which cause Joshua to doubt himself.[N 2]
Arriving at the PieZ restaurant in Rancho Coronado, Santo Domingo, Rachel  instructs Vasquez to take Stephenson inside and grab a table, so that she is able to talk with V. She offers V double Joshua's payment to walk away.[N 3][T 2]
If V refuses Rachel's bribe:
V heads into the restaurant and takes place at the table to talk more with Joshua and Rachel about the braindance and other topics, until Rachel gets fed up and tells V off before storming out. Joshua says goodbye to V before also leaving with Vasquez. Johnny will reappear and have some thought-provoking comments. This concludes the job, and pay is transferred shortly. A day later, Rachel will call V to attend Joshua's crucifixion.[T 3]
If V accepts Rachel's bribe:
After accepting Rachel's bribe, Rachel heads inside, telling V that they'll say goodbye to Stephenson on their behalf. Some time after completing, Rachel reaches out to V about their payment, and transfers them 4600 eurodollars.[N 4]
If V asks for a bigger bribe (Corpo only):
V demands a bigger cut, as they're familiar with how high the budget for producing braindances can be. Rachel begrudgingly agrees before heading inside, telling V that they'll say goodbye to Stephenson on their behalf. Some time after completing, Rachel reaches out to V about their payment, and transfers them 9300 eurodollars.[N 4]
If V decides to leave:
After talking with Zuleikha, V decided to leave, concluding the job.[N 4]","Talk to Joshua Stephenson.

After arriving at the Coyoto Cojo, V speaks with Mamá Welles, who offers them a beer and asks how they are doing. V tells her that they want to take part in the ceremony as well and do it in the right tradition, but that they are unsure about what to place next to his urn. Mamá tells V not to worry and hands V the the key to Jackie's garage, and assures V that they can find something in there from Jackie's past that will be appropriate.
When V approaches the garage in the alley behind the Coyote Cojo, they find Jackie's girlfriend, Misty, is sitting in front of the garage door. V asks her what she is doing there, and she tells V that she is waiting for Jackie to return, even though she knows that won't happen. After speaking with her a bit more, they both enter the garage.
Inside the garage, V looks for a suitable offering.[N 1][N 2]
If V finds the Key to Jackie's Room:
On the desk, V finds the key that unlocks the door in the garage. Upon opening the door, Misty and V uncovered that Jackie attempted to make a mandala.

V proceeds to look for other objects that could be used in the ofrenda.

After Search and Destroy and another part of Tapeworm, Johnny will eventually ask to allow him to control your body so he can explain everything to Rogue to get her to help him take out Adam Smasher. V heads to the Afterlife and after talking with Johnny, takes the pill to surrender control to Johnny.
The events of the side quest A Cool Metal Fire take place.
V wakes up in a motel room, with Rogue Amendiares watching over them. She tells V that Johnny told her about Adam Smasher and then she leaves to gather more information about the Ebunike.
Ebunike[]
After about a day, Rogue calls and reveals that the Ebunike is an old container ship moored in Night City and ask V to meet with her back at the Afterlife to discuss further. Head over and after a short conversation with Crispin Weyland, follow Rogue out to her car where she'll give V a Replica of Johnny's Samurai jacket. They hop into Rogue's car and ride to the Ebunike Docks where the ship is.[N 1]
After spending some time to go over the plans and observing the location, Rogue and V enter the base and find a data term, which confirms that Grayson is currently aboard the ship. Rogue and V continue their path, and board the ship.
If V checks out the Kang Tao labelled crates on the Ebunike:
Rogue and V uncover that Adam Smasher was behind the Kang Tao raid reported some time ago. The crates contain firearms that were bound for South Africa.
If V checks out the body in one of the containers:
V finds a female body in one of the containers. The woman was strangled then shot point blank with hollow point rounds four days ago, as deduced by Rogue. According to Johnny, this is Adam Smasher's signature style.
If V checks out the audio recordings on the computer:
V can uncover that Adam Smasher was pulling the strings behind Militech backing out of a deal with Night Corp, as he was blackmailing Anthony Gilchrist by taking a woman by the name of Mallory hostage.
If V checks out the suspicious packages:
V finds some suspicious boxes labeled ""Tri-phet.""
After a short firefight with Grayson and his remaining goons, in which Grayson is defeated but not killed, he'll insinuate Rogue was actually on the same side as him at one point and there's more to the story on why she wasn't hunted down and killed after the Arasaka Tower bombing, but when V asks Rogue about this, she'll just note he's trying to distract V from their goal to find Smasher. Grayson will reveal that Adam Smasher is back in Japan, having been promoted to head of Arasaka's security, and thus unlikely to return to Night City. He tries to bargain his way into being spared, offering a special keepsake of Johnny's they can have if V lets him go.[N 2] After dealing with Grayson, Rogue becomes upset and V talks to her before her departing. Johnny suggests to give her a moment and let her cool down.
The Oilfields[]

They_Won%27t_Go_When_I_Go,Story_Characters,"Some time after leaving the PieZ restaurant after talking with Joshua Stephenson and Rachel Casich, Rachel will call V to say that Joshua has requested their presence while he prepares for his crucifixion braindance.
If V refuses the first time:
V says they currently don't have time to come, which will cause Joshua to plead with V over the phone, claiming that they need V to be present during recording. Rachel tells V that they'll receive extra compensation for their time.
If V refuses again:
V apologizes and tells them that they are on their own.[N 1]
If V agrees:
V agrees to help out and heads to Fourth Wall Studios, where there's a group of people protesting against ""The Passion of Joshua""'s filming.[T 2] As V approaches the gate, they are hailed by Vasquez, who tells V that Rachel has been waiting for them, and instructs V to go to the building down the street with the NCPD Officer out front. After the Officer lets V inside, they talk to Rachel, who instructs them to talk to Joshua in the dressing room.
V approaches Joshua, and sits down on the stool in front of him. Joshua tells V that he is having second thoughts about recording the braindance and asks for V's opinion.[N 2] Eventually, Joshua will ask V to join him in prayer.
If V agrees, and lets him pray:
V and Joshua clasp their hands, and Joshua will recite Saint Augustine's Prayer to the Holy Spirit.
""Breathe in me O Holy Spirit, that my thoughts may all be holy.""
""Act in me O Holy Spirit, that my work, too, may be holy.""
""Draw my heart O Holy Spirit, that I love but what is holy.""
""Strengthen me O Holy Spirit, to defend all that is holy.""
""Guard me, then, O Holy Spirit, that I always may be holy. Amen.""
If V clasps hands with Joshua, and does the praying:
V and Joshua clasp their hands, and V recites a prayer.[N 3]
If V doesn't want to pray:
V refuses to join Joshua in prayer, making Joshua pray silently on his own.
A moment later, Rachel enters backstage and interrupts Joshua and V, stating that the time has come to record the braindance. Joshua asks V if they want to perform his crucifixion.
If V agrees to crucify Joshua:
V accepts to crucify Joshua. After picking up the hammer, and waiting for everyone to be in position, V nails Joshua's wrists and feet to the cross while reciting the lines from the teleprompter.[N 4][N 5]
If V does not quit during the recording:
V presses the button to raise the cross, and waits for Joshua to pass.[N 6]
If V quits at any point during the recording:
V says that they are unable to continue with nailing Joshua to the cross, and another actor continues to fulfill the role instead. The actor presses the button and raises the cross, as V waits for Joshua to pass.[N 6]
Afterwards, V talks with Rachel, who will tell V that they'll reach out to V at a later point for their payment.
If V refuses to crucify Joshua, but agrees to stay:
V refuses to perform Joshua's crucifixion, and witnesses another actor fulfill the role instead.[N 4] After the crucifixion is finished and the cross is raised, V waits until Joshua has passed.[N 6] Before leaving, V talks with Rachel, who will tell V that they'll reach out to V at a later point for their payment.
If V refuses to participate and leaves the area:
V refuses to partake in Joshua's crucifixion and leaves Fourth Wall Studios.
V is contacted by Rachel again two days later, and she tells V that the braindance has been published.
If V was supportive of Joshua's actions:
Rachel exclaims that the braindance was a hit and thanks V for their help, and promises a bonus for them. After the call finishes, she will transfer V a moderate sum of eurodollars.
If V was not being supportive:
Rachel tells V that the braindance was of poor quality, and is angry with them. Despite this, she will transfer V a small sum of eurodollars.","Talk to Rachel.

Don%27t_Lose_Your_Mind,Story_Characters,"If V encounters the traffic jam in City Center:
A few days after helping Delamain recover their divergent vehicles, V encounters a traffic jam on the Ring Road in Corpo Plaza, City Center.[N 2]
Upon approaching the traffic jam, V will encounter three Delamain Cab that have intercepted a Kaukaz truck, and Johnny Silverhand will project himself to talk to V. Johnny suggests that V try and contact Delamain to investigate further.
When V calls Delamain, it quickly becomes clear to them what is happening. The virus that has been corrupting Delamain's systems has now also infected the core system, and Delamain asks V for help.
If 48 hours have passed after completing Epistrophy:
A few days after helping Delamain recover their divergent vehicles, Delamain calls V to let them know that they are in need of help, as the virus they discovered has now also infected their core systems.
Upon arriving at Delamain Headquarters, V finds Delamain having difficulties communicating. It tries to open the doors toward the offices and garages but fails to do so. Unable to find any other ways to enter through the reception area, V leaves the building and manages to find an alternative entry point.[N 3]
Inside the building, V searches for a way to open the locked door that is barring their way. They manage to find a terminal, with which they can unlock the door.[N 4] As V treads through the hallway onto the workshop, they can hear multiple drones patrolling the area and attacking each other.
After managing to find a way across the workshop floor, V enters the control room. In the control room, each divergent Delamain tries to influence V by asking to be set freed by them, with the exception of the original Delamain, who asks V to reset the core.
As V approaches the core, Johnny projects himself in front of them, asking V to not reset the core.[N 5][N 6]
If V resets the core:
V chooses to reset the core and restores the original Delamain.[N 5] Because resetting the core also wipes his memory, Delamain has no recollection of who V is, but is able to access previous logs to identify them as the person who has helped them get rid of the virus by resetting the core. After exiting the core, Delamain will transfers V ownership of one of the vehicles from their fleet, as has been declared by Delamain's ""previous version.""[N 7]
If V hacks the core (requires a high Intelligence check):
V chooses to hack the core and merges the divergent Delamain's with Delamain's core, creating a singular Delamain entity who has no other desire than to leave Night City.[N 5] Upon speaking with the entity, he will mention that he leaves his ""one true son"" to V, and state that he will remain at V's side until their dying breath, before bidding them farewell. After exiting the core, the remaining Delamain asks V to enter the cab, and will introduce themselves as ""Junior.""
If V destroys core:
V chooses to destroy the core, and liberates the divergent Delamains, who flee from the garage of the facility.[N 5] Upon speaking with Johnny, he will mention that one of the Delamain Cabs has apparently stayed behind in the hangar. When entering the cab, he will introduce themselves as ""Excelsior,"" and allow V to become their new ""owner.""","If V goes to the traffic jam in City Center:

 — Divergent Delamain, Human Nature
After recovering in their apartment from the aftermath of Konpeki Plaza heist, V receives a message that their car—the Archer Hella EC-D i360—was returned to the Megabuilding H10's parking lot.[N 1]
Upon entering the car, it is immediately rammed by a divergent cab from the Delamain Corporation, wrecking V's car.[N 2] This incident causes Johnny Silverhand to appear before V, and they have an exchange of words.[N 3]
Upon exiting the car, V receives a message from the Delamain Corporation to visit their headquarters in Vista del Rey.
Some time after the incident, V receives another text message from Delamain, this time to let them know that their car has been repaired.[N 4]","Fetch your vehicle from the parking garage.
Talk to Johnny Silverhand.
Get out of the damaged car.
Read the message from Delamain.
Keep busy while you wait for the car to be repaired."
Dream_On,Story_Characters,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: none given]
Some time after investigating Lucius Rhyne's murder, V will receive a call from Jefferson Peralez requesting that he investigates another case for him and his wife.
At the Peralez apartment in Charter Hill, Westbrook, Elizabeth will guide V to the living room. There, the waiting Jefferson explains that he witnessed an intruder in their apartment several nights ago. Jefferson recalls shooting the man but losing consciousness shortly thereafter. Oddly, their private security, SSI, denies that any incident occurred. After the talking, Jefferson leaves the apartment for an election meeting, leaving Elizabeth to help V check the clues.
Elizabeth will begin with a brief tour of the apartment, but will soon let V to freely explore. During the investigation, V can explore the apartment and scan certain objects to ask Elizabeth for some information, such as their diplomas from Asukaga-Berkeley Law School, their wedding photo, their family's photo etc. During these investigations, V will likely soon notice that Elizabeth's memory is chaotic. For example, Elizabeth says her husband has never smoked, but V has previously seen Jefferson smoking; Elizabeth says the roses during the wedding are blue, but they are actually red in the wedding photo. V can also read a message about Jefferson's failing memory on one of the computers. Moreover, checking the computers in the control room downstairs reveals that SSI security are actually aware and complicit in the ongoing events.
Scanning the corridor upstairs will reveal patched bullet holes in the wall and chemically scrubbed residues of blood, which you should follow. Along the way, you will find a broken screen of smart glass, which you can attempt to repair with sufficient Technical Ability. Touching the screen this way triggers a shock that affects both V and Johnny, although Elizabeth notices nothing during the event. Eventually, the trail will lead to a wall that you can scan to find a hidden door. V can gain entry to this hidden room by force (requires 9 Body), via the computer in the control room (use the code 6709, which can be found in an adjacent computer station, or by hacking the station), or through a hatch on the roof of the building. Regardless, V will find a secret monitoring station, whereby Elizabeth and Jefferson were being observed without their knowledge. Elizabeth will be shocked and presently feels head discomfort, leaving V to continue the investigation alone. Scan the strange computer in the room, which will prompt V to follow the cables trailing upwards.
The nearby ladder leads to the roof of the building, where there is an old-fashioned transmitter, which Johnny notes resembles those used by Militech during the Second Central American War. Because such antennae rely on line-of-sight, V can find a distant van near another antenna. After finding it, V can return to Elizabeth and tell her about the transmitter, before leaving the apartment to find the van. Upon doing so, Johnny will suggest that V goes on wheels rather than on foot.
The vehicle in question is parked in the Japantown sub-district of Westbrook. Upon approaching, it will be revealed as a heavily modified Emperor 620 Ragnar, which will begin driving away, requiring V to pursui.
If V loses the van:
V calls Elizabeth, explaining the situation as the mercenary was unable to find who was behind the spying. She is disappointed, but will tell her husband about potentially investigating Holt. Elizabeth pays V and the mission ends.
The Ragnar will enter Northside and eventually go to a Maelstrom compound near the All Foods Factory. V's goal is to connect to the access point on the vehicle. One can sneak in by climbing to the roof using scaffolds in an alley to the right, but after going into the building. On one of the agents, V can find an encrypted shard regarding Project Condin.
Accessing the vehicle's database will uncover evidence that a shadowy organization is manipulating the brains of Jefferson, Elizabeth, and others to modify personalities and behavior. This process has already caused severe memory loss to both Jefferson and Elizabeth. Johnny suggests downloading the data, but after doing so, the data is deleted by someone. After the investigation, V must call Elizabeth and apprise her of the situation. She will ask the merc meets with her in person before doing anything else.
Elizabeth can be found at a ramen shop in Yagami Market. There, she will explain that she has already noticed Jefferson's changing personality, and she fears that she is also changing. Knowing her husband and fearing the consequences of his reaction, Elizabeth will implore V not to reveal the truth to Jefferson.
Jefferson will be waiting for V in Reconciliation Park in The Glen. When nearing the meeting location, V's optics will be spiked and they will receive a call from an unknown individual, who warns them not to cross the line by revealing to Jefferson what they have learned.
In the meeting location, Jefferson asks V about the investigation result, who can choose to tell Jefferson the truth about the brainwashing or lie and omit the information.
If V tells the truth to Jefferson:
Jefferson is shocked by the terrifying truth, and also angry at Elizabeth about lying to him. He will decide to play along with his manipulators' plans until he sees an opportunity to expose them but potentially risking his life and the lives of his family.
If V follows Elizabeth's words:
V tells Jefferson that there is no news and the SSI had been receiving money from Weldon Holt among many other clients. Jefferson will decide to win the election first, and then deal with Holt.","Go to the Peralezes' apartment.

Tune_Up,Story_Characters,"After V's car is wrecked by the divergent Delamain Cab, V is contacted by Delamain to visit Delamain Corporation's headquarters on Pajaro street in Vista del Rey, Heywood, to assess the damages done to V's vehicle and receive compensation.
When V arrives at the location and enters the building, it is evident that they are not the only one that was attacked by a rogue cab, as numerous other Night citizens are there to file a complaint against the company. As V cuts in line and talks to the receptionist—which is currently running on a subroutine of Delamain's core. After V's identity is confirmed, Delamain himself will take over and talk to V and apologizes to them, and explains to V that they are currently occupied dealing with an internal crisis. As compensation for their damaged car, Delamain transfers V a sum of 4900 eurodollars.[N 1]","Go to Delamain HQ.

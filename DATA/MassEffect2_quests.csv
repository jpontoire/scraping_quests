Kelly Chambers will tell you that Mordin wants to speak with you in the Tech Lab. You can also access the journal.","Tuchanka Clan Urdnot[]
Commander Shepard arrives at Tuchanka
Welcome to the blasted homeworld of the krogan and varren. This planet has seen everything, including nuclear war. When you arrive at Tuchanka, you can see many krogan near the landing pad. When you try to enter the Urdnot base, the squad captain stops you and tells you that for your own safety you must speak to the clan leader, who will be either Wrex or Wreav, depending on your choices on Virmire in Mass Effect or whether you started your campaign in Mass Effect 2. You do not have to speak with the leader immediately. In fact you can bypass him entirely for Mordin's mission by speaking directly to the head scout.
Walking down the hall, you will be treated to some interesting comments by your squadmates. EDI will also tell you of any pending tasks or your progress after the missions on Tuchanka. When you enter the main area, there are a few things to note. To your left is a shop called Ratch's Wares, straight ahead is varren fighting pit, to your northwest is pyjak-killing mini-game and the head scout, to the northeast is the clan leader, up the ramp is the mechanic, and behind the mechanic to the right is Fortack. Choose to speak with the clan leader first or take a look around.
Clan Leader[]
Wrex: When you approach the Urdnot throne, the guards hold you back while the clan leader is speaking with Gatatog Uvenk, an emissary from a rival clan. The clan leader is clearly annoyed and the guards tell you to wait for Wrex to call you. Wrex turns his head at that and welcomes his old friend. You can have a conversation with him about what he is doing on Tuchanka and his progress since two years ago. Ask about Mordin and Grunt’s missions on Tuchanka. You can ask him to join you but he says that his place is here. Wrex will tell you to speak with either the Chief Scout or the Shaman respectively.
Wreav: Wreav is puzzled to see a human, and depending on your decisions in Mass Effect, there are a few interesting conversation lines. You ask the same questions as above, but Wreav is not as friendly. He will direct you to the same people when you are done.
Chief Scout[]
The Urdnot chief scout (the one on the right)
End the conversation and head over to the chief scout. However, before beginning, look around if you didn’t before. Be sure to get the small side assignment from the mechanic and look at the shops. Ratch will give you a discount if you kill some pyjaks with the turrets located by the Chief Scout, assignment: Tuchanka: Killing Pyjaks, Fortack will give you a discount when you complete both missions on the planet, or if you manage to kill the Thresher Maw during Grunt's loyalty mission.
When you speak with the chief scout he is well aware of the situation and where the Weyrloc Clan is hiding, in an old hospital, ask why to get a laugh. He will tell you to also be on the lookout for a scout that he sent to investigate the situation. This triggers the assignment Tuchanka: Old Blood: Missing Scout. You can choose to take the truck now or if you missed the mechanic, go back and get the side assignment, Tuchanka: Combustion Manifold from him otherwise you will not be able to complete it.
Hospital Approach[]
Once you choose to go to the hospital, there will be a short cutscene with a load screen depicting Shepard and the selected squad rolling across the ruins of Tuchanka. Once you arrive there is a Weapons Locker, use it if you wish. Move out through the door next to the weapons locker, then around the U-Turn and be prepared to take cover immediately. The first fight will not be with Blood Pack but with some native wildlife, two klixen. Move around and take them out at your leisure but remember that klixen explode when they die, so keep your distance. When done with the klixen move forward, and go through an opening to your right. One klixen and two varren will show up as you round another U-turn right when entering the opening. Two Blood Pack Boom-Squad await you. After you are done with them move on by turning left up an old broken highway.
Shepard's team travels in a tomkah to the hospital area
General Tactics: Throughout this mission, there are several tactics which will come in handy repeatedly:
Burn off armor with Mordin's Incinerate, or with weapons (preferably using Incendiary Ammo)
Slow charging klixen, varren, and krogan with Mordin's Cryo Blast. Alternatively use Concussive Shot or biotics.
Use flame to halt the regeneration of varren and krogan.
Once armor is stripped, Mordin's Incinerate will make Pyros explode violently, damaging other nearby enemies.
The next area is an old highway that has some cover on it. As the Blood Pack really don’t want you getting to that hospital they attack you on the bridge. Use the standard tactics of moving from cover to cover and take out your enemies. Once they are down move up if you haven’t already and before rounding the curve pick up the Medi-gel and the refined iridium (+600 iridium). Then move into cover as more enemies come around the curve. This group will usually contain a Pyro so take him out from a distance. Round the corner and take cover as more enemies will be waiting for you. Tip: On Insanity there will be four Pyros, in two groups of two. Strip their armor and then use Mordin's Incinerate to make them explode prettily. Don't let them get close to you under any circumstances.
This is the last area outside the hospital so after this it turns into an indoor battle. Use the cover to take out the Blood Pack members. There is usually a Boom-Squad and a Pyro in the area. Once the enemies are down move to the ruined tank on the right side, directly across from where you entered, to recover the combustion manifold for the Urdnot Mechanic, then move to the door and save your game before entering.
Hospital Interior[]
Mordin examines a human body
Entering the hospital you only have one way to go down the stairs to your left. At the first landing you find a dead human body. Selecting this starts a conversation with Mordin and you can learn about the experiments being conducted, and how Mordin hates using live subjects because it is barbaric and not his definition of science. Once you feel satisfied that you now have more reasons to take this place out, ending the conversation with the options can earn a few morality points. Move on down the stairs and don’t forget to pick up more refined iridium (+600 iridium) to the right at the bottom of the staircase. Move around to the door and save your game before opening the door.
The next room will contain a Clan Weyrloc Speaker. He just wants you to go away. During his (otherwise very long) speech there'll be a Renegade interrupt. While the clanspeaker is monologuing about the ""grand plans"" that Clan Weyrloc have for the galaxy after curing the genophage (which includes sending the Citadel ""into the sun"" and keeping salarians as slaves), Shepard can cut it short by shooting at the pipe with the flammable gas below the Clanspeaker. The Clanspeaker first laughs at the human's inability to shoot straight, but Shepard's second shot detonates the leaked gas and incinerates the Clanspeaker. If you don't take the interrupt, be prepared for a slightly harder fight. Once the conversation ends, take cover and shoot the enemies on the upper level. The krogan will charge down the ramps down to get to you while vorcha hang back and provide covering fire.
Tempted to use the interrupt yet?
Combat Strategy: From Shepard's initial cover position it is quite difficult to successfully target the enemies up on top of the ramp, yet you are very much exposed to their fire. Therefore move to your left and take cover where you can instead get clear shots at them as they emerge from the bottom of the ramp. Strip the armor from each krogan in turn, knock them down with powers, use Incinerate to stop their regeneration, and then take them out.
Tip: On higher difficulties this fight can be hairy due to the amount of enemies, your low ground position, and the fact that several krogan will be closing on you while some vorcha pin you down. A good way to make it easier is to have the M-622 Avalanche as your heavy weapon option. First, have the Avalanche selected before you enter the room and trigger the cutscene. Right at the start of the fight after the cutscene ends, fire a volley of 4-6 shots at the upper level where all of the enemies are grouped up outside a door. This will severely damage all opponents and should freeze the vorcha and knock them out of the fight until you've dealt with the krogan. The arcing shots of the Avalanche plus its large area of effect make it ideal for attacking enemies on higher ground; if you can't hit them directly it's enough that you land shots on the walls near them.
When the combat is done, pick up the iridium (+300 iridium) and the medi-gel before moving up the ramps. Move across the upper level and through the door that the speaker came out of. Around the corner and through another door are circuit boards that you can salvage (+3,000 credits). This area seems to be some type of laboratory, judging by the equipment and the dead krogan female in the room to the left. The room to the right will contain some more iridium (+500 iridium) and a terminal. Accessing the terminal will help to get Mordin’s tongue a little looser about his role in the genophage update project. Once you have the information you need, end the conversation.
The body of a female krogan volunteer poses a moral dilemma
The krogan body is yet another conversation. Initially Mordin scans the body to determine that it is female and how she died from multiple tumors. Mordin shows some repentance because he says that it’s his fault that she died. The rest of this conversation leads to some very interesting dialogue and what could be a tirade by Mordin about how true science doesn’t require test subjects. Some options cause Mordin to reconsider the ramifications of the genophage and eventually he even goes spiritual. He provides a few interesting opinions about the various religions across the galaxy and humans. End the conversation any way you choose to either agree with or express moral outrage at Mordin. There are some morality points to be gained depending on your choices. Before leaving hack the terminal to get the Krogan Vitality upgrade.
Move down the hall until you reach a door on the right hand side. Open the door to see the scout that the Urdnot Chief Scout asked you to look for along with a hackable datapad (+1,500 credits). He says that he is not locked up and that he is helping the krogan people. You can, through the dialogue, leave him there or convince him to return to his clan as a warrior. Convincing him requires certain dialogue options and telling him that the only reason that Weyrloc is researching the cure is to help them multiply. If you have enough Paragon or Renegade points you can get him to rise to his feet and run back to the clan. Once the deal with the Scout is done then move down the hall to the door on the left and be prepared for the fight. This is a good point to save the game.
Warning: The next door will lock behind you and you will not be able to go back. The door stays red and when used it will say door cannot be opened with enemies around, even if all enemies were killed. Make sure you look for the Scout and gather everything before moving forward.
Research Lab Exterior[]
Opening this door leads into a room with a platform in the middle and it looks, if you look down, like some kind of atrium. Don’t take too much time to admire the sights because the Blood Pack will attack once you go through the door. They like to cross the explosive crate laden bridge, so watch out for explosive crates until the end of the mission. You can also use them against your enemies. Once you have killed all of the hostiles, go to the other side of the platform and salvage a circuit board (+4,500 credits).
Combat Strategy: Try to take out the two vorcha immediately so that you won't have to endure their crossfire as the three krogan come straight at you -- note that once you open the door but before stepping through it the vorcha will not yet be alert to your presence, so take the chance to snipe or otherwise surprise one of them. Then advance to the first turning point if you can, always trying to forestall having the krogan come around the corner and trap you without cover. Stasis will stun even an armored krogan; otherwise you'll need to strip their armor rapidly and then use Concussive Shot, Biotics, or Mordin's Cryo Blast power to slow them down. Take full advantage of the explosive crates when the krogan wander past.
Cross the bridge once you have those credits, and pick up the Medi-gel. As you proceed down the corridor on this side a krogan accompanied by a pack of varren will emerge. Take the varren down quickly before they reach you (the two explosive crates can come in especially handy here) and then the krogan can be dealt with.
You will now find power cells near the top of a staircase. Save your game before going down. Tip: If you aren't desperate for heavy weapon ammo, leave the power cells where they are for now, because if you grab them during the upcoming fight they will also restock the ammo for all of your weapons.
If you haven't the time to admire the sights in-game do so with this picture (and take a gander at the semi-hidden troops)
Once down the stairs get in cover immediately, and take note of any explosive crates you can make use of. First a pair of krogan will emerge from a doorway directly ahead of you - take them down before they get too close, using tactics you are probably getting pretty practiced at by now. Tip: You can retreat back up the stairs if the krogan get too close, gaining more time. They will helpfully follow you up, so just take cover and wait for them.
As soon as the two krogan are down, another group of enemies will emerge from the far diagonal door, including varren, krogan, and Chief Weyrloc Guld. Guld has a barrier as well as armor, carries a nasty shotgun, and throws biotics as well.
Combat Tips:
The varren are the most immediate tactical threat here because they can knock you out of cover and expose you to deadly fire. Fortunately they're fairly weak and you should be able to take them out quickly, simplifying the rest of the battle.
Next work on the accompanying krogan, retreating if they start to get too close, back up the stairs if necessary.
Using Medi-gel to revive your squadmates when they go down will help keep the enemies distracted. If you're especially sneaky you can sometimes wait until the krogan have moved past one of your downed friends and then revive them to create extra confusion.
Guld himself tends to lag a bit behind the others, and is best dealt with last when you can safely concentrate all your power on him. Stay well away from his shotgun - keep falling back as necessary.
When all the enemies have fallen look for a door on the right, it has a locked crate (+3,000 credits). Move across the bridge and down the stairs. BEFORE you go into the lab, hack the terminal at the bottom of the stairs for a Heavy Weapon Ammo upgrade. Once you are ready save because of the dialogue options in the next room and enter the room.
Maelon’s Lab[]
Maelon's Laboratory on Tuchanka
Immediately when you enter, you go into a cutscene. Maelon is at the other end of the room scanning a holo screen with an Omni-tool. Mordin confronts him and after a few words he realizes that Maelon is working out of guilt, and is not being coerced. You can offer an opinion on that point. At that point, Mordin confronts him about his research methods and his motives. Apparently Maelon can justify it because his hands are already bloody, and if it takes a little more to undo the genophage, it will be worth it. He sees the galaxy as a more dangerous place without the krogan because of everything that happened in Mass Effect and in the two years since. You can offer Mordin some guidance in dealing with the situation but it is up to him. Mordin eventually charges his former student and pulls a gun. You can use a Paragon interrupt to save Maelon’s life. Once that is done the matter of the data is still up in the air. There are four different dialogue options regarding what to do with Maelon's data. Shepard can convince Mordin to either:
Destroy the data (+15 Renegade points)
Save the data just in case (+15 Paragon points)
Save the data to help the krogan (+15 Paragon points)
Tell him the genophage was the right thing to do and to destroy the data (+15 Renegade points)
After the decision is made the option to end the mission comes up, you can choose to stay and hack a terminal (+3,000 credits). Hack it and then end the mission and return to the Urdnot Camp.
Note:  A bug will occasionally prevent you from leaving the room if you choose to ""stay"" in Maelon's Lab.
Urdnot Clan Base Post-Mission[]
When you return EDI gives you an update that clan Urdnot has gained in strength. If Wrex is clan chief, Urdnot adopts the remaining members of clan Weyrloc, mostly women and children. If Wreav is clan chief, then Urdnot gains strength by raiding Weyrloc's stockpiles, which Mordin calls ""survival of the fittest"". The player can then find the Mechanic and give him the manifold for bonus experience, credits, and dialogue.
Mass Effect 3 Consequences[]
If Maelon's data was saved, Mordin uses the data to stabilize Eve, resulting her survival at Priority: Tuchanka. If it was destroyed, then Eve will die during the mission. If Wrex was sacrificed on Virmire, and the data is not saved (leading to Eve's death), then Mordin can be saved if Shepard's reputation bar is high enough and a persuasion option is chosen. Otherwise, Mordin will sacrifice himself during dispersal of the cure for the genophage, or will be killed by Shepard.
Email[]
After the mission, if you persuaded him to return to base, scout Urdnot Darg sends Shepard this email entitled ""Back from female camp."":
From: Urdnot Darg

Dear Human,

The clan leader told me how to get in touch with you. I don't remember much of what happened, but the chief scout said you pulled my quad out of the fire when I got caught and poisoned over at the Weyrloc camp. Thanks. Next time I have a chance to kill a human, I won't. Unless I go into blood rage or something.

I got to go to the female camp after I recovered, and it was pretty good. I was actually thinking of joining the Blood Pack before this happened. I think I'm going to stay here instead.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Lair_of_the_Shadow_Broker_(mission),"Prerequisite: Lair of the Shadow Broker  and Horizon (mission)
A message from Cerberus is sent to Shepard's private terminal after completing the mission on Horizon:
Shadow Broker IntelTo: Shepard
From: Cerberus Information Processing

We're aware that your old friend Liara T'Soni has been hunting for the Shadow Broker for several years. We wouldn't mind helping her in that hunt, given the Broker's past work for the Collectors. We recently uncovered some information that might give Liara a lead on where to find the Shadow Broker's base of operations, but unfortunately, she doesn't have much faith in Cerberus intel. If you'd visit Illium and pass it on to her as a gesture of goodwill, we'd appreciate it.
On the Galaxy Map this mission is titled Give Liara Intel.","Illium[]
Meet With Liara[]
Head to Illium and talk to Liara in her office above the trading floor. Liara is ecstatic about the information as it contains some hints about the Shadow Broker’s location in a conversation between Shadow Broker agents. However, the message also contains information that Feron, Liara’s former drell partner, is apparently still alive. Respond to that any way you choose, and then Liara will express that after two years, she didn’t know, and looks at Shepard's old dog tags on her desk.
Liara then gives some of the backstory for Shepard about how even though Feron betrayed her, he still sacrificed himself to save Liara and Shepard. Liara then walks out to begin forming a plan, and invites you to use her terminal for any local intel. If you haven't recruited Samara or Thane yet, then the terminal will have information about them. This is the same information that you would get from talking to Liara normally. If Samara and Thane have both been recruited already, there is no intel available on Liara's terminal.
When finished here, head over to the Cab Console near the police station area (past the signs that say 'Nos Astra Shuttle Schedule'), and take a cab to Liara’s apartment.
Note: If the Lair of the Shadow Broker conversation option is selected after starting Illium: Liara: System Hacking, the hacking mission instantly completes without awarding credits or experience. Therefore, complete it before beginning the Lair of the Shadow Broker DLC.
Liara's Apartment[]
Liara's apartment
When you arrive, you will find the police are investigating the apartment under the supervision of a Spectre, Tela Vasir. Vasir dismisses the Illium cops and then the conversation will differ slightly if Shepard’s Spectre status was reinstated or not.
Talk to Vasir about the attack and what happened. Apparently, someone attempted to assassinate Liara, and even with that, she still stuck around for some reason. Vasir currently doesn’t have information about her current location, however, nor did the cops find anything more. Vasir says that they couldn’t find anything, but she invites you to look around for anything that they may have missed.
Investigate the apartment by looking at specific things:
Bullet Holes in Window ('Shot Impact'): Vasir will say that the rifle used to do that wasn’t standard issue, and while Liara’s kinetic barriers stopped the bullets, they still penetrated the glass.
N7 Armor: A piece of Shepard’s old armor that Liara recovered.
Degree Certificate: Apparently, Liara got a doctorate from the University of Serrice on Thessia. Vasir mentions that she’s getting her money's worth out of that degree.
Painting: A view from the planet Ilos, presumably of the tunnels area (previously seen by Shepard and the team). Vasir will claim she doesn't know what planet that is but assures that it isn't Thessia, at which point Shepard recognizes it as Ilos.
Picture: On the upper level is a photo album that changes from the SSV Normandy to a Prothean dig site. Tela Vasir comes up and Shepard mentions that Liara did leave a message.
Liara's apartment has an amazing, if gloomy, view
Investigate the Prothean relics around the apartment:
Relic Top Level: Nothing of note except that it is apparently worth a fortune.
Relic Near Door: Nothing of note; Tela Vasir thinks it’s ugly.
Relic: Bottom of stairs: It contains a backup disk. When played, it shows a recorded conversation between Liara and one of her contacts, Sekat. He apparently has nailed down where the Shadow Broker is and he can narrow it down to a cluster, maybe a system. He asks Liara to come to his office at Baria Frontiers in the Dracon Trade Center.
Note:  You can also interact with Vasir directly while she works for several unique comments from her.
Dracon Trade Center[]
When the team arrives, Vasir mentions that the Frontiers office is on the third floor. When the squad gets to the top of the stairs, the building explodes. Three floors of the building were taken out to make sure that Liara didn’t get the information she wanted. Vasir takes off in the skycar to seal off the building from the top, while Shepard and the squad work from the bottom up. Get moving; there are some civilians outside, but they have no information as to what happened, so proceed inside.
When you get inside, the building is a mess from the bombs. There is an employee of Baria on the floor to the right, Tela Vasir mentions that Shepard shouldn’t count on Liara’s contact surviving that blast. There is also a locker in the area (next to the doorway leading to the Atrium Offices) that provides 3750 credits. The elevator on the left hand side of the atrium is locked down and the building’s security isn’t responding. Vasir mentions that it was professional based on the lack of security and police response. Head up the stairs to the right, there's medi-gel from the Medical Station along the way.
Trade has ceased for the time being
The next plaza contains the salarian embassy on Illium, Nezo Transportation, both currently locked down, a PDA (+2500 credits), and another medical station with medi-gel. Examining the dead employee reveals that he was killed, not by the explosion but by gunfire. Shepard relays this to Tela Vasir, who is surprised and mentions that this was more than just an explosion after all. Head up the stairs in the center of the plaza to find a hackable ATM (+6250 credits). Off to the right are some power cells, near Exsolar Shipping.
Tip: If you're not short of combat supplies like medi-gel or ammo, leave them for now as you will have a chance to return here later.
Off to the left, there's a military grade bomb that wasn’t armed. Vasir mentions that they employ similar hardware when they don’t have time to plan. Head into the Baria Frontiers Office just past the unarmed bomb.
Tip: Save before you enter the Baria Frontiers Office. You will not be able to save until multiple waves of enemies have been killed and you have covered a lot of territory.
Examine the log book on the left to find that Liara signed in just a few minutes ago. Head inside, but before you start exploring, take a moment to shoot out the glass logo reading ""Baria Frontiers"". Take cover beneath the window.
When you approach the window or hallway, the squad is suddenly blinded by a flashbang grenade and now you’re under attack. Shepard radios to Vasir that they are pinned down, she replies that Shepard should say hello to the Shadow Broker’s private army. You are attacked by three Shadow Broker Agents and a Shadow Broker Heavy. There is plenty of cover, so make use of it. You can knock out most of the Agents from your spot at the window, but you will often have to head down the hallway on the right to root the Heavy from behind some cubicle desks.
Be careful as you move toward the room that's to the left side of where you entered, because new enemies will spawn there: three Agents, and a Shadow Broker Vanguard. Take them down as quickly as possible because they are a big threat, especially the sturdy Vanguard who can absorb quite a lot of damage. If you headed straight in from the original entry room you'll find the cover situation tricky, but if you are approaching from the right rear with the cubicles (where the Heavy likes to hole up), you'll have a fairly safe approach. There's also a terminal on the left side of the room (+3000 credits).
Combat Strategy: Keep your squadmates in cover under the window for this part of the section. The Shadow Broker mercs will look like they are going to flank you to the right but they won't. As you eliminate the mercs, have Shepard run out into the room to trigger the remaining waves of mercs. You may have to move Shepard far out into the room and run back to the window to take cover.
The renovation business is about to have a big customer
Once they are down, move your squad up. Keep moving toward/down the rear corridor and you will encounter more Agents and another Heavy. Use the cover to take them out then round the corner to be attacked again, this time by more Agents, Heavies, and a Shadow Broker Engineer. The small ""diagonal"" box where the back corridor debouches into the next big room is a good starting cover while you survey the room. There will only appear to be one enemy at first, but as soon as you engage the rest will arrive.
Advance slowly, and only after eliminating some enemies, as many more will spawn suddenly as you approach the other end of the corridor. The Engineers have Combat Drones and the Agents have Flashbang Grenades, so be prepared to shift cover locations when necessary. You may find it safer to hide among the cubicles and desks on the right side of this corridor, since it exposes you to fewer enemies at a time and allows you to pick some off individually.
Combat Strategy: Keep your squadmates in cover back down the hallway from the small diagonal box the start of this portion of the section. Have Shepard take cover back from the box so that the mercs can't hit Shepard. The shadow broker mercs will look like they are going to flank you to the right in the cubicle area but they won't. Peek out into the room and take down the mercs using weapons and powers. As you eliminate the mercs, have Shepard run out into the room to trigger the remaining waves of mercs and then run back to the cover area. Watch out for the combat drone that the Engineer spawns often. Just run back down the starting hallway, the combat drone will follow Shepard, and your squadmates will take it down. No need to waste ammo.
When the enemies are finally down, there is a Terminal (+3000 credits) in the side room, and a medical station with medi-gel in the cafeteria at the end of the hallway. Also, on a purely aesthetic note, there is quite a nice display of planetary mining locations in the room with the cubicles -- if you played the original Mass Effect you will have Mako flashbacks.
Head around the corner to see the stairs blocked by fire, but don’t try to go into it; the results won't be good. Shepard radios Vasir about it and she says to find a switch to activate the fire suppression systems. It's in the side room right to your left where you can find the maintenance console and a crate of eezo (+1000 eezo). Once the suppression systems are active, don’t leave the room before Shepard salvages the Machinery (+1500 credits) then leave. Vasir mentions that she is on her way down, so move up to meet her.
Tip: The fire suppression room is a good location to save your game for the upcoming sections.
On the upper level, be prepared for more combat with three more Agents. Use the limited cover to take them out, and have your squadmates flank, then head into the room they were guarding. Inside is a research terminal, access for a Heavy Pistol Damage Upgrade and keep moving into the next room and grab the credits from the wall safe (+5000 credits). Open the door to continue.
Combat Strategy: Keep your squadmates in cover at the bottom of the stairway and have Shepard peek around the corner up the stairs at the three Agents once they spawn. The Agents will not come down the stairs and can easily be eliminated by chipping away at them from down the stairway. Watch out for the flashbangs that the Agents throw and just go down to the bottom of the stairs anytime Shepard needs to recharge shields.
The merc has a very weak bargaining position
Inside you see Liara’s contact being shot by one of the Broker’s Agents. Tela Vasir then shoots the Agent, who falls dead when Shepard and the squad enter. Vasir asks about Liara’s body, then Liara herself emerges wielding a pistol at Vasir. Attempt to defuse the situation, but Liara will mention that Vasir tried to kill her. Shepard and the squad pull their guns, and Liara tells the story about how Vasir signaled the Shadow Broker's Agents and broke into Liara's apartment. Vasir then killed Sekat and took his data, which she probably still has on her.
Vasir tries to get away, by using her biotics to shatter the glass and calling Liara a pureblood while she’s at it. However, Liara throws up a barrier to protect the squad and Vasir makes a run for it. Shepard tackles her, and then they fly out the window. Vasir cushions their fall with her biotics and has a small scuffle with Shepard. Then Liara leaps out of the office, also using her biotics to cushion her fall while the squad watches.
Vasir, now outnumbered, makes a run for it. Liara follows closely behind, blowing past two Shadow Broker Agents in the process. The squad rejoins Shepard in the plaza where more Agents emerge from the Eldfell-Ashland Energy office, allowing Vasir to escape. Deal with the guards and continue pursuing Vasir.
Pursue Vasir[]
Hailing a cab isn't simple in 2185
Take out the Agents with haste. There are two Agents and a Heavy to deal with initially, so keep to cover. When they fall, more Agents and a Vanguard emerge, so use the fountain in the center for cover. It not only provides effective cover, but allows for a wide field of fire. Indeed, if it happens to be useful for your tactics, you're actually allowed to get into the fountain.
When they all fall, the benefit of leaving the power cells alone earlier will become apparent -- make a quick trip up the central stairs to retrieve them, and the ammo of all your weapons will be replenished. Now head downstairs and into the atrium. Inside, grab the cover provided by the bench to your left -- resist the tempting large circular column straight in front of you, as its shape makes for more difficult aiming and you aren't allowed to slide smoothly back and forth around the pole.
Take down the ten or so Agents, the Heavies, and the Engineers that try to stop you (the mix appears to vary somewhat by difficulty setting). They will keep coming from the door in waves, so stick to cover and target them as they walk in. Overload can be used to instantly destroy the Combat Drones that the Engineers produce, and it's a good idea because getting dislodged from cover by a drone with this many enemies nearby can produce deadly results.
Tip: You can prevent most waves of enemies from spawning by getting to the far corner of the room where the Heavy is. This is most easily done by an Engineer, who need only send the Combat Drone to that side of the room. Vanguards can charge over, Infiltrators can sneak over, etc.
Combat Strategy: This entire battle can be completed without straying into the room to be overwhelmed by the mercs. Place your squadmates into cover in the top hallway before you go down the first stairway to the landing. Place Shepard on the second set of stairs looking out into the large room. Have Shepard walk down the stairs to flush out the first of many mercs in this area. Use weapons and powers to chip away at the mercs and the mercs will stay stuck in cover. Watch out for the Flashbang Grenades that the Agents throw and just walk backwards up the stairs anytime Shepard needs to recharge shields. Walk back down the stairs and chip away at the mercs in the room until they begin to fall. As you kill a merc, another will spawn out of the doorway to replace the dead merc. Watch out for the Engineers as they will spawn Combat Drones. When this happens, have Shepard go back up the staircase past your squadmates and have them take the drone down to conserve ammo. Sometimes the mercs will stay in cover that will require Shepard to move out into the room to take them down. Watch out for the Shadow Broker Heavy in the back left corner! The Heavy will stay stuck in cover and will not move out of cover until Shepard goes out into the room after the Heavy.
When the mercs are all finally down, gather up ammo and head out the door to find Liara and Vasir engaged in a firefight.
Tip: Save before you enter the door as you will be unable to save until after the sky way chase.
Vasir calls her skycar and then jumps into it. Liara then grabs a taxi, followed by Shepard. You can only select one squad member to come with, but remember that Liara is a biotic so pick carefully. On the other hand a squadmate with Warp to detonate Liara's Singularity is quite handy. Since Miranda has both Warp to combo with Liara and Overload to take down shields, she makes an excellent pairing. Other notable strategies include Thane who combines Warp combo powers with Shredder Ammo for all the upcoming organic enemies, and the easily-forgotten Morinth whose Dominate can run all the organics in circles attacking each other. When you select your squadmate, hope you have that driver’s license handy as now you have to pursue Vasir through the skies of Illium.
Sky Way Chase[]
Jack makes an appearance on a billboard as part of her new modeling career
When you get control of the skycar, use the following controls to steer the vehicle:
Xbox 360/PlayStation 3: Use the left stick to navigate, the right to steer, and the left trigger to boost.
PC: Use your mouse and normal movement keys to move forward and steer (default W, A, D), and the spacebar to boost.
Keep following Vasir through the skies, and watch out for the traffic, and every other obstacle. Above all, don’t lose Vasir. Just keep in mind that boosting reduces the amount of control you have. If you lose Vasir, the chase will restart. Your boost is more effective if you use it in bursts, especially right after changing directions, rather than simply holding it down.
Liara will be commenting the whole time, which Shepard usually replies to, and the conversations are usually funny. Sometimes, however, her conversations help with direction. After a period of time, Vasir will start dropping proximity bombs, so avoid them, lest you lose speed. Then Liara mentions that Vasir has reinforcements, and Shepard asks if the car has any weapons, to which Liara replies, ""It’s a taxi, it has a fare meter,"" so that would be a no.
Tip: You do not have to repeat the entire sky way chase if you fail right at the end. Once you get far enough into the chase, if you fail, you will respawn in the middle of the chase.
Keep following Vasir and try to avoid a head on collision. Eventually, you are treated to a cutscene where Vasir tries to ram Shepard and the squad out of sky, while dodging traffic, but only succeeds in colliding with another skycar, and damaging hers. She crashes on a building, the Azure Hotel, and is approached by a LOKI Mech, which is then destroyed. Shepard and the squad see the crash and land their intact cab on the top of the building to pursue Vasir, who radios for backup.
Rooftop Chaos[]
Shadow Broker mercenaries enjoy only the best hotels
You now have Liara as a squad member equipped with a heavy pistol and an SMG. She also has her class Power Asari Scientist, Singularity, Stasis, and Warp, which is unlocked with Singularity at level two.
IMMEDIATELY stop and make sure you distribute Liara's squad points to her abilities as it will not be done automatically. Save your game before you move! This is very important as the upcoming battle can go wrong very fast and you will have to redistribute Liara's squad points all over again if you die. Some experience is also awarded at this point, so you and your other party member may also have additional points to spend if you leveled up from this.
Legendary Edition:  This battle begins as soon as you land on Azure without giving you a chance to manually save, though you can still bring up the menus to allocate squad points. A literal truckload of enemies will be dropping in directly ahead of you so be ready.
Squadmate Powers Tip: For both of the major ""boss"" enemies to come in this mission, Stasis will stun or at least distract them even when they have intact protections. It also instantly destroys the flying drones you will encounter from time to time, and of course it has its traditional ability to simplify a combat by temporarily removing and knocking down any enemy footsoldier. For these reasons, fully upgrading Liara's Stasis with the Enhanced Stasis evolution is strongly recommended. Fully max out Asari Scientist as well, and don't waste any extra points on Singularity.
When you regain control, grab the med-kit from the car while Liara makes a note about Vasir’s car and how she can’t have gotten far. Head up the stairs only to be ambushed by three to five waves of Shadow Broker Agents and Engineers. The first wave will be to your front, the second and third off to either the left or right on the upper platform, or behind you on the lower platform, so plan your cover appropriately. However, the subsequent waves will not appear until the previous one has been eliminated. On higher difficulties, the next wave flies in after a squad has been reduced to one member, so move quickly and eliminate the enemy before you are flanked by the new arrivals.
Have your party take cover at (A) where you can sit for the duration of the fight. The first squad of enemies always drops in at (Y). The biggest danger is a squad dropping in on your weak side around (Z), in which case...
Combat Strategy: Be aware that the instant you move the first wave of mercs will show up so you need to get to cover quickly. Ignore the med-kit for now unless you aren't full already (also don't be stingy with medi-gel during this fight as you will have plenty of refills afterwards). There is a left stairway, a middle stairway, and a right stairway in this area. An optimal spot to fight this battle from is in between the two parked vehicles just to the right of the middle stairway. Once you get there and are facing away from the edge of the building, to your left will be a large van that is fairly tall for cover which is excellent, and to your right will be a red skycar. Place your squadmates in the corners where the fronts of the vehicles meet the high wall in front of you, and remember that you might need to ""remind"" them to stay there after each wave. You will be almost totally safe from enemy fire here as the enemies you face generally won't try to rush you and instead congregate on the raised area up the stairs above you. Shepard can hug the wall or get in the corner against the van and the wall to be totally out of the line of fire in order to recharge shields.
The first wave of mercs will drop while you are moving to cover and will run to the elevated cover above you. The mercs can be hard to hit as they go to cover often and run back and forth but they can be chipped away at slowly and safely from your ""safe zone"" with weapons and powers. Keep an eye on your ammo, but don't worry if you start to get low, you'll be able to fill up once this fight is over. Also keep in mind that enemy Engineers can recharge their shields periodically so make sure you kill them outright or at least do damage to their health bars before they have a chance to do this.
There are two major threats in this cover position: one is the Combat Drones that the Engineers will spawn (there is one Engineer with each wave), and the second is the chance that a wave of enemies will land right on the ledge near the exposed rear of your cover position (where each enemy wave after the first touches down is random and you could get unlucky). If this happens, don't panic. The best solution is usually to pull out your heavy weapon (one that does good area damage, see below) and blast away right when the doors on their vehicle open and they are still tightly clustered. Even if you don't do this and the enemies all pour out, surprisingly they usually won't all rush into your safe zone and kill you but will instead go up to the high ground like the other waves. For any enemies that actually do advance into your ""safe zone,"" save Liara's Stasis for them, prioritizing enemy Engineers. Even an Engineer will be instantly disabled and ragdolled by Stasis and can be easily dispatched once the effect wears off.
... bring out the big guns and hit them before they can hit back. The Avalanche works well; if you're feeling trigger happy, do this for every truckload of mercs for a quick win.
Alternative Strategy: Hit the reinforcements with area damage powers and heavy weapon fire just as their hovercars land and the doors open up. The Arc Projector or M-100 Grenade Launcher can decimate them before they all ditch the hovercar and start spreading out. The best weapon for this strategy by far, however, is the M-622 Avalanche. Not only will the Avalanche freeze an entire attack group in 5-6 shots but it allows you to take them out at your leisure, letting you control when the next wave spawns. Regardless of the difficulty level, using this more proactive strategy as each wave approaches makes this fight both easier and less time-consuming.
Note:  Try to avoid having your squad or Shepard use force powers like Pull, Throw, Slam, or Shockwave as these can eject an enemy from the battle area - for some reason, enemies are not killed by this. Enemies flung off the roof or out of the area in this way remain alive yet unreachable thus preventing subsequent waves or the scripted crash that marks the end of the fight from triggering. Your only choice out of such a situation is reloading an earlier save, or if you are on PC and have the console enabled, using the ""KillEnemies"" command. Even Singularity can unfortunately sometimes create this situation, especially if you then detonate it with Warp. The good news is that Azure is the only part of the mission plagued with this problem - you can Singularity & detonate freely once you reach the Shadow Broker's base.
Once the battle is over, go back and get the med-kit from the car (if you didn't already) and collect the credits from a bank terminal near the door that the first wave blocked (+1500 credits). Collect any ammo from the area and save your game! You don't want to do that battle again.
Now head to the left side of the platform and go into the glass walled room; it’s the only one with a green door sign. Once you get inside, you hear a conversation, but bypass the wall safe on your right first (+6000 credits) and take the med-kit ahead of you. Then head into the room where there is a patron on the ground, but talking to him accomplishes nothing, so talk to Liara about the video. She will provide some information about the hotel and its name, as well as give you another good laugh.
Head out to Vasir’s car where Liara will note that there is a blood trail; Vasir was wounded in the crash. There are some power cells in her car and access the broken panel for a Damage Protection Upgrade. Follow the blood trail until it reaches another room. Inside, there is a lot of dead bodies, but some more interesting things. In the room on your right is a Weapons Locker, so switch weapons if you need to, and a med-kit with medi-gel. In the main room is a medical station for a second medi-gel in this area and a personal datapad (+2500 credits). Grab both before leaving.
Tip: This is a perfect place to save your game before the upcoming boss battle.
Tela forgets that there are two Spectres present
When you exit the second door, the blood trail leads to Vasir, who is still walking and trying to blend in. However, Liara pulls a gun and she stops. Vasir immediately grabs a civilian to use as leverage, then she puts her gun to her hostage’s head and demands that Shepard drops all their thermal clips and power cells. If you have enough morality points, Charm or Intimidate options will allow you to end the standoff without hurting the hostage: Shepard distracts Vasir while Liara biotically levels her with a table. If you don’t or can't pick either of those options, you will have to either give in to Vasir's demands, meaning that you will either start the ensuing battle with zero thermal clips and no heavy weapon ammo, or you will have to wound the hostage. Giving up your ammunition will force you to scavenge for more in the surrounding area which isn't too hard as there will be several respawning clips around, but there will be no power cell refills, precluding you from using heavy weapons during the fight and disadvantaging you even afterwards. Regardless of how the situation is handled, you will now have to duel with Vasir.
Note:  There have been multiple reports of level 30 characters being unable to select the Renegade/Paragon dialogue option, even with a full Renegade/Paragon bar. This is because of how morality works in Mass Effect 2. If you run into this you may need to further maximize morality points by selecting the +100% Paragon/Renegade class power evolution as opposed to the +70% Paragon/Renegade class power evolution.
Fight Vasir[]
Don't get Tela wet...
Tela Vasir has vast amounts of barriers, armor, and health. While you outnumber her three to one, she still presents a tough challenge. Vasir will use her biotics to charge around the battlefield and occasionally at Shepard or a squadmate, making her hard to hit at times.
Tip: Stasis works on Vasir, but be careful as over-using it can build up her resistance to it until she's immune.
When you damage her to about half of her barriers, she will jump out of the fight, leaving you to deal with two Rocket Drones and two Shadow Broker Engineers. Keep in cover during this fight as they will use Incinerate and Combat Drones, and the rockets from the flying Rocket Drones can be hazardous to your health.
When you defeat the first wave, Vasir makes a reappearance, so watch out and employ the same tactics as before. Keep her on her toes, keep shooting her, and when her barriers are gone, she’ll leave again. Deal with the second wave of Rocket Drones and Engineers, two of each once again. Just remember to keep in cover.
After defeating this second wave, Vasir drops back in one final time. She will still continue to charge around the battlefield, so keep moving. Once her armor is down, use any power you have to tie her up and then proceed to let her have it.
Note: Each time Vasir leaves the battle the game autosaves so you don't have to replay it from the beginning if you die. Choose ""Resume"" and you will start again at the last cutscene of Vasir leaving that you played through.
Party guests find the new waitstaff a bit aggressive
Tip: Once Vasir's barrier and armor are down, knocking her off the building ends the fight immediately even if her health has not been completely drained. This is most easily done by first lifting her using Singularity or Pull and following up with a well placed Throw, Concussive Shot or even a Charge if Shepard happens to be a Vanguard. Vasir reappears for the fight's ending cutscene even if she is knocked off the building in combat.
Once Vasir is finally down, you are treated to a cutscene where Liara retrieves Sekat's disk to find the information they need on the Shadow Broker's location while Vasir continues to rant. Shepard accuses Vasir of betraying the Council, which she fiercely denies, saying that she didn't do what Saren did. She had been getting information from the Shadow Broker for years, information that apparently saved lives; doing a few morally questionable tasks for the Broker was a price she was willing to pay in return.
Shepard retorts, but Vasir reminds the Commander of why the Spectres exist: to do the Council's dirty work. Then she brings up Cerberus and how Shepard is allied with them. Respond to that and she pointedly reminds Shepard of a few of Cerberus' choice experiments, accusing the Commander of hypocrisy. If Shepard is a Sole Survivor, she also mentions how Cerberus was responsible for the thresher maw attack on Akuze. After uttering one final warning not to judge her, Vasir takes her last breath.
Liara takes in the view while discussing the plan with Shepard
Shepard heads back inside where Liara is examining the disk. Apparently, the Shadow Broker really wanted Liara dead, and didn’t care about the collateral damage. Shepard arrives to inform Liara of Vasir’s death, and Liara forwards the data to the Normandy. A series of interrupts can then be taken in rapid succession; these do not award any morality points.
You can use the first Paragon interrupt to convince Liara that they will rescue Feron in time. If the interrupt is taken, Liara reminds Shepard of their past, and how they saved her on Therum, and fought the Krogan Battlemaster while she cowered in fear. She talks about how Shepard always helped her, and how she is still leaning on Shepard. Shepard responds that this is just what friends do for each other, wondering why Liara speaks of it as if it wasn't a good thing.
She goes on to talk about how they will reach the Shadow Broker's base, taking advantage of the Normandy’s stealth systems to keep them from being detected. Because the Broker’s agents are still fighting through Illium, they can use this as cover to escape without being noticed. A second Paragon interrupt will have Shepard chastise Liara for her apparent indifference to the deaths of innocent people. Liara protests, but Shepard reminds Liara about how she went after Vasir aggressively without a second thought or any concern for Shepard. She then brings up Sekat and how she knowingly put him in harm’s way without warning him of the danger, making her responsible for his death. However, she insists things will be simpler now: get to the Shadow Broker, get Feron, and get out.
There is a third interrupt opportunity, and if you romanced Liara in Mass Effect, then this interrupt will give you a chance to talk ""about us"". Liara explains what she went through for the last two years, and how Shepard can't expect that to instantly vanish. She apologises and asks if they can just focus on getting Feron back, to which Shepard agrees. If you are currently engaged in another romance, such as with Tali'Zorah nar Rayya or Garrus Vakarian, Liara will also comment on that, saying that her career as an information broker leads her to find out various things, including about Shepard. If you have no romantic history with Liara, she will state that ""enjoying the scenery"" is not an option while Feron, the man who saved both her life and Shepard's life, is still in danger.
Hagalaz[]
During this segment of the mission you will be facing the same set of mostly-shielded, mostly organic enemies as before, plus the addition of occasional mechs. You have the opportunity to select your squad and weapons again, but Liara is still a required squadmate. You may give some thought to selecting a different heavy weapon for this half of the mission; there are several battles that take place in areas where you have very awkward lines of sight or where enemies are very hunkered down in cover, so weapons that can deal indirect fire well such as the M-622 Avalanche, M-490 Blackstorm, or the ML-77 Missile Launcher can all be useful.
Squadmate Selection: Most of this portion of the mission can be completed from cover with methodical use of powers so in general, pick a squadmate with useful powers over one with powerful weapons. Miranda can be a good choice as her Warp and Overload powers make her effective against almost any type of target. If she has unlocked her Slam power this can be used to cause environmental kills as noted above. She also buffs your party's health and weapon damage with her Cerberus Officer passive, which continues to benefit Shepard and Liara even during the final boss battle when Miranda is not otherwise able to contribute. Another good choice is Jack. If she has Squad Warp Ammo she can greatly increase your damage against the Vanguards in this section, and her Pull can combo with Liara's Warp. Finally, Shockwave is excellent for striking unprotected enemies through cover and often knocks them to an environmental death, especially if used in tandem with Singularity.
Shadow Broker Ship Exterior - Part 1[]
Environmental Kills: While fighting on the exterior of the Shadow Broker's ship, using biotic powers that lift enemies off the ground such as Pull can cause enemies to fly away into the storm, instantly killing them. Enemies must reach a certain height for this to happen, so a single biotic power is often not sufficient unless you can cast it on an enemy exactly when it is leaping over an obstacle. The most reliable way to cause these environmental kills is to combo two biotic powers by using one to suspend an enemy or get them off their feet and then send them flying up farther with the second (e.g. Pull or Singularity followed up by Throw, Slam, or Shockwave).
You are treated to a cutscene where the Normandy launches the Kodiak over a planet where the Broker’s ship is located. Liara talks about the planet and its weather conditions, how the oceans freeze and boil, and how the planet is a maelstrom near the twilight band, which is what the Broker’s ship follows. She also talks about how they will have to land and seek out a hatch to get inside. Liara also states that they can’t stay outside for very long, as the weather and lightning can be a problem.
When you regain control, Liara mentions that while she can’t get a visual, she is picking up a massive communications array at the back of the ship. She says that there is nothing but maintenance areas under it, so that is where they have to get to.
Tip: Save your game before you move forward as this is the first time where you can manually save since the battle with Vasir. You are also awarded some experience at the start of this segment so allocate any unspent squad points if you level up from this.
Combat Strategy: For most of the merc battles coming up, put your squadmates into cover well in advance so they won't rush forward and you can carefully move forward or quickly retreat if needed. Peek out and take down the mercs using weapons and powers as you see fit. Focus on Vanguards first as they will charge towards you. Run back to your squadmates to have them help take down Vanguards; Liara's Stasis is usually the easiest way to take them down. Take your time and the mercs will fall.
Proceed left along the hull, and watch out for the Maintenance Drones. They are basically Combat Drones, but Liara mentions they are probably attacking because they think the squad is debris from the storm. There will be two pairs before you get to a ramp with some salvageable Conductor Components (+3000 credits), grab them and proceed.
As you come up onto the catwalk, Liara will mention that those capacitors discharge the lightning strikes, but then some more Agents pop up. Shoot the capacitors to make this an easy fight. Once they are down, you can just walk right past the capacitors and down to the left.
As you get onto the lower platform, you come across three LOKI Mechs, get into cover and deal with them with your weapons and powers. You can just biotically throw them over the side if you so choose. Keep moving and when you get to the next area, you will find another capacitor, Agents, and an Engineer. Again shooting the capacitor makes it easier, but also if you can get the enemies off the ground, then the wind can just take them away.
When you are in the clear, activate the Rod Controls to lower a lightning rod, and then duck into the trench it left because more enemies are present. This time you have Agents, and Engineer and a Vanguard to deal with, but you again have a lightning capacitor, so blasting it is a good idea.
When you get to the lower platform again, more LOKI Mechs are there to greet you. Take them out and proceed, but don’t pass up the Capacitor Components on your left (+4000 credits).
Keep following the path to your right, and down you will go almost to the keel before encountering a small area in the exterior hull where two Agents and three LOKIs are waiting. Get into cover, and focus on whichever enemy seems the most dangerous. It's a tight area so don't let anything approach too close; you can retreat back up the ramp if the mechs get too close or a flashbang lands at your feet. When the enemies are down, follow the ramps up to a door, and enter.
Shadow Broker Ship Exterior - Part 2[]
The engine room
When you get inside, Liara will mention that the ship must have taken decades to build in secret. Shepard wonders where the contractors went. At the engines, Liara will mention that if the engines stop for even a moment, it will be disaster, but at least the Shadow Broker will go down with them. ""Comforting"". A little further along is a refined palladium crate (+4000 palladium) and some power cells. Grab both before moving on. There is one final talking point, select the motion dampeners to hear Liara say that they probably can’t even feel the storm from inside the ship.
Head back outside and follow the ramps. At the bottom is a medical station so grab the medi-gel while you pass. When you reach the very top of the ramps, find cover because there’s more of that private army up here.
Tip: Save your game before you move forward up the ramp.
This particular group has everything, Vanguards, Engineers, and Agents. Use the lightning capacitors to weaken them, and then finish them off, but be careful as the overload from the capacitors can damage you and your squad as well. Again, biotically lifting baddies will cause them to fly away, so use that if you can, too. When you defeat them all, crawl over the barriers, and then find cover again on the far side as two more Agents will attack. They are easy to deal with, so make sure that they are dealt with quickly. Keep going down and then find cover again as three LOKI Mechs are waiting for you. Deal with the LOKIs, follow the path, then back up you go.
Combat Strategy: When the LOKI mechs appear, move your squadmates into cover several barriers back in the middle section, and then have Shepard draw the mechs to the first barrier. Do not have Shepard take cover behind the first barrier but back one more as the mechs will shoot right over the top of the first barrier while you are in cover.
The Shadow Broker's agents had better get hazard pay for this...
When you reach the top, be expecting company, or rather they were expecting you. At the top is a Heavy, two Agents, and a Vanguard. Deal with them any way you choose, no capacitors to help you this time, then move on. The Vanguard is probably the most dangerous because of her willingness to approach to close range, but if she's out of sight just take out whoever is available.
When you manage to get to the top of the hull, activate the panel controls to continue. A small path will open in the panels, head through it and when you get to the other side, go right, drop down, and then find cover. Two Agents will be there to meet you, so deal with them then shift to deal with the enemies to your left which will consist of more Agents, a Vanguard, and a few Engineers. Capacitors are available to help deal with these tough opponents, but be careful of the strange geometry of the cover here - not everything that looks like cover will work very well. When they all fall, move up but keep to cover as more Agents and a Heavy are right around the corner.
Combat Strategy: Once you enter the area by dropping down Shepard can't go back. Take your squad and quickly put them into cover as far down and to the left as possible. The jumbled nature of the cover here makes it hard to find good cover. If needed, run far backwards to recharge your shields. Move forward as needed to get mercs to spawn and to flush them out of cover. Take your time and the mercs will fall.
When you are in the clear again, head to the bottom to salvage some Conductor Components (+3000 credits), and then get up to the top to retract another rod. Once that one is down, move along the catwalk where Shepard comments about no guard rails and how it must be a joy to patrol the hull. Liara counters with at least there is a nice view. When you reach the end, there is a medical station and your way inside. Tip: Before activating the door, take a moment to explore the surroundings, noting the location of spare ammo cartridges, lightning capacitors, and good cover spots. When you activate the door, Liara starts to hack it, and now you must defend it over Shepard’s objections about her not testing it.
Tip: Save your game before you start the hack as the next battle is the hardest one of this mission.
Defend the Door[]
Liara observes a cookout
Warning:  If you die at any time during this fight, you will have to restart from the beginning of the fight, autosave or not.
Note:  There are a couple ammo cartridges on each side of the center aisle, but they do not respawn. Any additional ammo resupply for this rather long fight will have to come from taking what enemies may drop.
Get into cover as the Shadow Broker doesn’t like what you are doing. You'll be facing a total of five enemy waves consisting of everything the Shadow Broker can throw at you: Heavies, Vanguards, Agents, and Engineers along with a sprinkling of flying Rocket Drones, so just keep your cool and prioritize the biggest threats first. Don’t forget about shooting the capacitors whenever possible to damage and stun enemies that cluster nearby. If you're facing the bow (front) of the ship, the first wave approaches from the left side; once it falls there will be some brief dialogue between Shepard and Liara. While they talk, the second wave of enemies will be approaching from the opposite side of the ship as the first wave. When the second wave falls, four Rocket Drones will appear approaching from the bow of the ship. Take cover as best you can while taking them out.
When the drones fall, Liara mentions that the mercs would be more effective if they all attacked at once. Shepard playfully replies saying, “Please, don’t give the mercs ideas.” The fourth wave comes from the same direction as the first, so get into appropriate cover to deal with them. Finally, the fifth wave arrives from the other side again (like the second), with the mercs apparently taking Liara’s advice. The banter between Liara and Shepard continues as you fight. The fifth wave will also include Rocket Drones, so keep on the lookout for them and hit them with Stasis if they threaten you; lightning from the capacitors can also take them out.
Take cover at (A) for enemy waves approaching from (Y), and switch to (B) for waves coming from (Z); the middle wave is Rocket Drones, from which you can shelter at (C). Your squadmates can hide at (D) for the duration of the fight, and should be fairly safe as long as you cover them.
Combat Strategy: This long, challenging battle may take you two or three tries to get used to the timings and locations of enemy waves and is considerably easier once you figure it out. Before you start the hack, identify the cover locations you and your squad are going to occupy. The best places for Shepard to take cover are where the thermal clips are located: two very similar locations on either side of the central gangway you used to reach this area each have 2-3 thermal clips (as noted earlier, these do not respawn). The clips are practically the game's way of telling you, ""take cover here."" These locations afford good protection in all directions as well as line of sight to all four lightning capacitors; the best spot is the one to the right (facing the door) as it has slightly better geometry. It's possible to beat this fight without moving from here even on Insanity difficulty, though you can also alternate between the two spots depending on which direction the current enemy wave is entering from. As for your squad, it's best to leave them by the door away from you as this keeps them as far out of the line of fire as possible. Your squadmates don't hold up under enemy fire nearly as well as you do so leave them in the door ""pit,"" have them assist you with powers, and make sure you prioritize killing any enemies that may try to approach them (usually Vanguards).
Combat Tips:
Constantly shooting the lightning capacitors whenever they're charged will make this battle much easier and it saves ammo.
After each wave, your squadmates will be revived if they went down. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad idea to still use a medi-gel to get them up even if a wave is almost over, because the revive animation takes some time and you want to get them back into cover safely before the next wave swarms you.
After each wave your squadmates will also forget any orders they had to hold a specific position and leave cover, even if they survived. This can be a problem throughout Mass Effect 2 but is especially annoying here where the next wave of enemies swarms you immediately and you have precious little time to order your party back to safety. Be ready to ""refresh"" your squadmates' hold position orders as soon as you deal with a wave.
If your weapons are running low and you need to leave cover to scavenge for ammo, try leaving just one enemy from a wave alive as this will prevent the next wave from entering before you can make it back to cover. The rocket launcher-carrying Heavies are good to leave alive as they tend to stay in cover at a distance and they won't easily hit you if you're moving.
The biggest threats in this section are enemy Vanguards and Engineers which close on you or your squad, and enemy rockets, Combat Drones, and flashbangs that can stagger you or knock you out of cover. Liara's Stasis is absolutely invaluable for dealing with Vanguards, Engineers, and the flying Rocket Drones so be sure to save her cooldown for that purpose, and revive her ASAP if she falls. A battle like this is not the time to be stingy with medi-gel. Having Stasis as a bonus power for Shepard can also work very well.
The Rocket Drone wave is dangerous but certain tactics can make it less so. The drones' rockets deal heavy damage but fortunately don't stagger you out of cover, so cling to cover that shields you from the fire of as many of the drones as possible. There is a low wall right outside the door pit that is probably the most effective cover for this wave, but don't stay there once the drones are down. Despite being flying enemies, most of the drones won't move too much and won't flank you if you aren't too close to them. Liara's Stasis will freeze and destroy a drone instantly, so save it for any drone that's able to get a clear shot at you. Having Energy Drain as a bonus power is effective as you can damage the drones while simultaneously restoring your shields. Otherwise, use medi-gel if you're taking too many hits.
When the fifth wave is down no further enemies will appear. Conveniently, the hack also completes and the door unlocks. Take a moment to catch your breath and pat yourself on the back, search the area for ammo, and proceed inside.
Shadow Broker Ship Interior[]
When in doubt: Add more screens!
Note: All your thermal clips will be refilled at this point except on higher difficulty levels. Don't forget to top off as much as possible before going through the door.
Once inside, more of the Broker’s private army rush to intercept you. In the first hallway, there are two Agents, an Engineer, and a Heavy. The cover geometry throughout this section is unusual, so you may have to get creative.
Combat Strategy: The first hallway inside the ship presents a difficult challenge. When you first start after the loading screen you are immediately in the thick of it with four mercs coming at you including an Engineer that can deploy Combat Drones, and a Heavy firing rockets, both of which can knock you out of cover. If that wasn't bad enough, your starting cover is barely adequate and your squadmates are exposed. Also, if you were using ammo powers granted by a squadmate you'll need to have them re-apply it. All of this is bad, but on top of it all this area is somewhat wonky when it comes to using powers against the enemies, with many squadmate powers like Liara's Stasis refusing to properly hit enemies unless Shepard steps closer to them. Focus on the Engineer first, then the Heavy, and then the Agents while taking care not to get hit by rockets, drones, or the Engineer's Incinerate. Try to put the Engineer in Stasis immediately to keep him from using his abilities, though you will probably have to advance down the hall a bit to get in range to lock on to him. Using a volley of heavy weapon fire here is perfectly justifiable due to your weak position and the number of strong enemies you're facing immediately.
Once all of the nearby mercs are dead, any downed squadmates should revive, and you can also save your game. Proceed carefully, as the next hallway around the corner has more enemies including a Vanguard. It's advisable to keep your squadmates in cover behind you and just call upon their powers. Move forward and up the stairs. Liara will mention that she downloaded the ship's layout and that they are heading towards the Prison Block and Feron.
When you round the next corner, there will be a Vanguard standing watch with two Agents and an Engineer. Again, the strange geometry of the cover combined with the tendency of enemies to jump through openings in the walls to flank you means you'll need to be careful. Open fire and take them out before they have a chance to do the same to you.
Combat Strategy: Get the attention of the Vanguard and it will follow you back down the hallway to your squadmates sitting in cover and hit her with Liara's Stasis to be extra careful. Sneak back up and take out the Engineer being mindful of the drones he can spawn. You can then take out the two Agents in the room by using the cover across from them. Be careful as some of the Agents often run out and try to flank you. Just retreat back to your squadmates if your shields go down.
When they are down, the door at the end of the hallway won’t open, so backtrack a little and head into the room they were guarding. Inside the room access the Terminal (+4500 credits) and a med-kit for some medi-gel.
Bypass the door where you will find Feron, Liara’s objective.
Feron in restraints
When you enter, Liara runs down to try and release Feron, but this results in him receiving a painful shock instead. Feron explains that if he is pulled out now, then his brain will fry. They must cut the power from central operations first. Any time Feron tries to answer a question he gets shocked, so ask quickly. When you finish your conversation, get back into the main room and into cover.
Three Agents and a Vanguard will be on the attack, but they are also out of cover. Put them down before they have a chance to get into cover -- the last couple you may have to carefully dislodge. When they fall, head to the previously locked door, and proceed.
Follow the hallways until you reach a security checkpoint with just a single Agent. Put him out of his misery then access the Terminal (+4500 credits) and the med-kit for the medi-gel. As you enter the final room, a cutscene plays. Meet the Shadow Broker.
Confront the Shadow Broker[]
The Shadow Broker welcomes Shepard and squad to his humble lair
Shepard and the squad storm the Broker’s office, where the Broker calmly awaits them. Shrouded in darkness, the Broker is clearly a species never encountered. Civilly asking if Shepard and Liara are here for Feron, the Broker will note Shepard's actions are reckless, even considering the Commander's history.
After Shepard and the Broker trade words, Liara demands Feron. The Broker reminds her that her own actions put Feron in his situation. If the Collectors have not yet been defeated, the Broker will state that their offer for Shepard still stands. If the Collectors have been defeated, the Broker announces his intention to use the Normandy's IFF to salvage any remaining Collector tech.
Ignoring Liara's threats, the Broker notes the team's third squad member, and arrogantly disregards Liara, as he knows all her secrets. In response, Liara identifies the Broker as a yahg, likely taken from his world as a trophy or pet. Enraged at this reminder of his pathetic origins and Liara's defiance, the Broker smashes his desk and throws it at Shepard, knocking out the third squad member, who becomes unavailable for the remainder of the battle.
Note:  While you and Liara speak with him, the Shadow Broker will also comment on your third squadmate. Depending on who that squadmate is, his comment on them will change accordingly.
Kill the Shadow Broker[]
Let's get ready to rumble!
The first part of this fight isn’t hard, just keep shooting him in the face and moving from cover to cover if he gets too close.
When the Shadow Broker's shields and armor are destroyed, a short cutscene will play where he raises a kinetic barrier which deflects both energy and bullets; time to do this the old-fashioned way. Run up and melee the Broker before he has a chance to respond. You are then treated to a short cutscene involving Shepard and the Broker in a short fist fight. Before Shepard can come around again, the Broker uses his omni-tool to raise a shield which blocks all bullets. His shields and armor are also fully restored.
Repeat the same process you did before, keep shooting and move to avoid getting too close to the Broker. Be warned that when he charges now, he will go right through cover, so get out of the way. Now is a good time to use distracting tactics to get on his unprotected sides: the Broker can't see through Tactical Cloak, the Broker can be distracted by Combat Drones (see below), and so on.
When you destroy the Broker’s shields and armor, he will again go into the state. Melee him before he comes out of it - if you don't get there in time you will have to do this part over again. You are again treated to a cutscene. The Broker takes a few more hits before control is returned to you.
The third time, everything is the same, but the Broker will make more mistakes and fumble more easily. This time when you destroy his shields and armor, melee him to witness the Broker's fall.
Combat Strategy: The basic strategy is to keep the Shadow Broker at arm's length to avoid being hit by his dangerous, cover-breaking charge attack that can also stun you. Just keep leading him around the room while chipping away at him with the weapon most effective against his current layer of protection (e.g. use an SMG against his shields and a heavy pistol against his armor). The Broker usually ignores Liara completely but if he doesn't and decides to start shooting at her, she'll die quickly especially on higher difficulties unless he's interrupted. A good way to do this aside from doing a lot of damage to him is with Liara's Stasis; while Stasis won't freeze him it will briefly stun him for about a second which usually causes the Broker to switch targets back to you buying enough time for Liara to live. This can also be a good way to suppress the Broker if you need to break cover.
Combat Tips:
Combat Drone makes this fight almost laughably easy even on Insanity. Use the drone to perpetually distract the Broker recasting it immediately whenever it is destroyed, and just shoot him.
Tactical Cloak does fool the Shadow Broker, enabling an Infiltrator to easily displace to a new area whenever the Broker gets too close. However, cloaking may cause the Broker to focus fire on Liara and down her.
The final cutscene shows Shepard providing a distraction while Liara gets ready. On Shepard's cue, Liara brings down the electrified liquid in the tank above the Broker. The liquid causes the Broker's barrier to malfunction and explode from an extreme overload, destroying the Shadow Broker for good.
Meet the New Shadow Broker[]
Liara takes on her role as the new Shadow Broker
As the squad picks themselves up, the camera cuts to Feron’s cell; the power cuts, and Feron is gone. The scene shifts back to the Broker’s office and all of the various Broker agents begin asking for updates at the same time. While Shepard helps the other squadmate up, Liara focuses on the communications. She looks like she is going to be overwhelmed, then puts her head down, and walks forward.
Liara makes a few taps on the panel and communicates that the situation is under control, using the old Broker’s voice modification, and makes up a story. Feron, who is running away, hears it and then doubles back. Feron storms into the Broker’s office, pulling his gun, but stopping dead when he sees it’s Liara. He starts asking questions, but Liara explains that she is the new Shadow Broker. You can ask if this is what she wants, and she is sure. Feron excuses himself by saying he’s going to check the power systems, and your other squadmate goes with him.
Shepard can comfort Liara with a hug, and a brief kiss can also be shared if you romanced her. There is a very brief Paragon interrupt available if Liara is your romance option, which confirms the relationship.
She walks over to the computer and notes that there are no safeguards or user restrictions, almost like he would be the only one to be in this office. Liara mentions that she will have more for you later, and maybe turn the operation around. When you leave, she says that the door is always open and that Shepard is welcome back any time. Shepard can subsequently invite Liara over to the Normandy regardless of whether she was romanced in Mass Effect. However, if she was romanced, this will partially alter the dialog and Shepard and Liara can talk ""about us"". If Liara meets Shepard in the Captain's Cabin, she will return the Commander's old dog tags, recovered from the wreck of the SSV Normandy, which are afterwards displayed on the nightstand in the cabin.
You now have permanent access to the Shadow Broker Base, which you should explore as it offers much of interest. You can invite her to the ship now, or in a later visit. You can also have a conversation with Feron."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Miranda:_The_Prodigal,"Prerequisite: Horizon (mission)
Miranda's loyalty mission becomes available after completing the events on Horizon. You'll have to bring Miranda with you to Illium to be able to talk to Lanteia.","Illium[]
When you land on Illium, EDI will message you after your conversation with the concierge, and say that Miranda’s contact is at the Eternity bar. Miranda will thank EDI and you head towards the bar. Upon meeting Lanteia, Miranda's asari contact at the Eternity Bar, it is revealed that Miranda's old childhood friend Niket, one of the few people she trusts, will be involved in the transfer. Shepard can ask Miranda if Niket is trustworthy and Miranda replies that Niket is the only person she trusts from her past life.
Illium Cargo Terminal[]
Eclipse mercs await Miranda's arrival
During the flight towards the cargo terminal, Miranda notices several Eclipse Gunships at the cargo area, which a cutscene then shows several Eclipse mercs, deploying from the aircraft. Miranda tells Shepard to land behind cover and the mercs. The mercs open fire, though an Eclipse Engineer, who is supposedly expecting you, orders them to cease-fire. However, the cab had been damaged from the open fire, forcing a hard landing a few meters away from the mercs. The squad exits the disabled cab and a conversation starts with the Engineer.
The Engineer informs that you have arrived too late and his captain, Enyala, is moving in on Oriana and Niket will not be helping Miranda. As an angry Miranda accuses him of lying, the Engineer gloats that their conversation has given his snipers time to take position. At this point, you have an option for a Renegade interrupt. If you choose to interrupt, Shepard will break the Engineer's neck while Miranda pulls her pistol and shoots the merc standing behind the Engineer. Shepard then glances up and fires a few shots at an overhead fuel container, which falls and explodes. Then the squad runs into cover and the fight begins. If you didn’t interrupt the Engineer, he will order his fellow mercs to attack while you and the squad are in the open. Run into cover and take out the mercs. Regardless of the course of action, you will be battling against Eclipse Troopers, Heavies, and Vanguards.
Eclipse Mercs attempt to repel the Commander's squad
Remain in cover while taking out the mercs and be watchful of the Heavies as they fire rockets at you. After disposing the group of mercs, move up and take cover at the right turn because there will be even more mercs there. They are using the cover to take pot shots at you, so wait until they stick out their heads and shoot them as they appear.
The moment you enter into the elevator, another cutscene plays. Miranda finds an Eclipse radio and taps into their communications. Miranda then confides to Shepard that though Oriana is her genetic twin, she took her when she was just a baby. She goes on to say that she was not the first child that her father created, just the first one he kept and she had left behind everything from that life except Niket. Once more, Shepard questions Niket's trustworthiness but Miranda reassures Shepard again that Niket is a trusted friend.
Container Transfer Area[]
The squad enters the first cargo area
When you enter the area, Miranda points out that since all the containers are being moved around, it will be harder to target and acquire enemies. She also warns you that some of those containers consist of explosive hazardous materials. Go into the container on your right to hack a datapad for 1,500 credits, though this container is easy to miss. Just as you reach the first conveyor belt, you will come under attack.
Use the elevated cover in the middle to your advantage and take out the enemies on the opposite side. Watch out for enemies trying to flank you, especially on the left. At times, the enemies will remain behind cover and not return fire, so get closer to take them out. Also, be wary of the explosive containers as you are shooting because the explosion can kill you if you are too close to it. After dispatching the enemies, go further down to find a med kit in a corner of a container and a submachine gun upgrade on a desk in the next container.
As you come around the next corner you will be attacked by some Loki Mechs; just grab cover and fend them off. You can then grab 1,500 credits from the locker on the far side of the small room - note these are easily missed, so don't proceed down the hallway from where the mechs attack before picking it up.
Cargo Terminal Conveyor Two[]
Now when you move into the hallway the mechs attacked you from, a large group of mercs will attack from your right. If you jump up on the ""pickup truck"" and take cover there, you will be shielded from any mercs who try to flank you from the left side. Once all the enemies are down, head across the belt and search for a medi-gel upgrade on a dead merc and hack the computer in the office room for 3,000 credits. When you emerge from the office room two more enemies will spawn around the corner, including one firing rockets, so be ready.
Cargo Terminal Conveyor Three[]
This cargo area is filled with Eclipse engineers
When you go down the hallway to the next area, you hear Enyala over the radio ordering her troops to send everything except her personal guard to stop Shepard and the squad while she goes after Niket. As you head down the hallway, there will be more resistance around the corner. At the last conveyor before you reach the elevator to Dock 94, you will face numerous Eclipse mercs including multiple Engineers. Your squad can get finished off quite quickly by the combined firepower you're facing here, so it may be better to leave your team back out of the line of fire and only use them for power support while you move up carefully and pick off the Engineers one by one. If you have Kasumi in your party, a Flashbang Grenade can be very useful here to stun enemies out of cover, overheat their guns, and silence the flood of Incinerate bolts and Combat Drones coming your way; otherwise, you'll have to be very careful about being stunned by these abilities.
The Eclipse Heavies are more likely to flank you than the other type of mercs, but the latter will still attempt to flank you if you don’t force them to hide with suppressive fire. The Eclipse will attack in several waves from the left, so do not proceed until the coast is clear. Move over to a dip in the conveyor line and Miranda will say that it’s a way across. You can use this to flank enemies, but this is not recommended as it usually just results in them flanking you. Search the area for 3,000 credits on a security terminal and a crate of eezo. There are also 3,000 credits, which you get after hacking the pad of a dead merc in one of the crates.
Cargo Terminal Elevator Approach[]
Miranda in one of Mass Effect 2's few elevators
Just as you enter this area, EDI notifies you that the mercs have disabled the elevator leading up the dock, though EDI is in the process of overriding the elevator. Take cover immediately as enemies will begin pouring out of the elevator in at least two waves, though an Engineer's Combat Drone or a Vanguard with charge can prevent the appearance of additional enemies by approaching the elevator. You can also use an appropriate heavy weapon to massacre the enemies before they get out of the elevator and spread out; again, reaching the elevator door personally should then forestall additional enemy spawns. Defeat the mercs and retrieve the power cells across the elevator and medi-gel in the medical station.
Tip: Make sure you have all of your ammo powers assigned and weapons selected how you want them before entering the elevator.
Just as you enter the elevator, a cutscene will play. You hear Enyala radioing orders to transfer the family to an Eclipse Transport. Miranda become frustrated with the possibility of Niket betraying her and smacks the elevator to speed it up.
Dock 94[]
Niket and Enyala discuss the transfer of Oriana
Continuing from where the last cutscene left off, Niket looks frustrated at the asari dock official because of a security situation, referring to Shepard and the squad blasting through the terminal, and as a result, she cannot transfer anyone out. Enyala sarcastically remarks about the waste of time, but Niket reminds her that minimal impact on Oriana and the family is necessary. Shepard and the squad arrive from the elevator while the dock official tries to run, but Enyala mercilessly shoots her. Miranda confronts Niket in disbelief at how he had sold her out and a conversation ensues.
At the end of the conversation, Miranda draws out her gun, intending to shoot Niket. A Paragon interrupt allows you to stop her from killing Niket. If you interrupt, Niket will apologize but Enyala will shoot him in the back instead. Either way, Miranda biotically flings the Eclipse Captain across the room and a battle begins.
Enyala wields a Claymore one-handed and displays flashy biotics
Take cover behind safe positions in the dock while holding out waves of Eclipse mercs. If you are playing as a Soldier or an Infiltrator, the sniper rifle can be useful in killing Enyala from a distance. Unless you have access to a sniper rifle, you'll want to get moving, as you will quickly be flanked by Eclipse Vanguards and Troopers, including a group led by a powerful salarian Eclipse Operative, who is essentially a well-armed and armored Engineer. Stay aware of Enyala's position at all times while you systematically mop up her soldiers; note that further Eclipse will be spawning from the elevator on the far side, the one marked ""EXIT"".
This final battle can get very frustrating on harder difficulties as both Enyala and the asari Vanguard will close with you and attempt to murder you and your squad with shotguns all while an army of other mercs is shooting at you. Staying in cover where you begin the fight will usually end in disaster. A heavy weapon like the M-622 Avalanche or the Grenade Launcher can quickly eliminate the mass of mercenaries before Enyala is able to get close to you. Keep a careful eye on your squadmates' health and immediately revive them with medi-gel if they go down—keeping them up and having their abilities available can be essential to your own survival. Stasis if you have it is invaluable as it can knock Enyala or the asari Vanguard out of the fight immediately and make them easier to kill. While throwing a Combat Drone out immediately at the beginning of the battle can prevent further Eclipse from spawning by the elevator, it can also trigger them to rush your position aggressively so this is not recommended. If you want to use drones, summon them at Enyala constantly to slow her advance.
The following are two strategies that can make this fight more manageable:
(A) Starting position (B) Take cover here (C) Squadmates hold here
Combat Strategy: Run to the right and towards the orange-colored elevator. From inside the orange-colored elevator facing out, to the right going out of the elevator there is a hall ending in a dead end. Order your squadmates to the very end of the cul-de-sac, where they can sit safely, cover your back, and support you with abilities. From inside the elevator facing out straight ahead there is a roughly L-shaped piece of cover. Head there immediately. If you are careful to stay within the crook of the ""L"", no enemy should advance beyond this point unless you accidentally lead them to you by stepping out too far. The exception to this is the Eclipse Vanguard, who you should take out ASAP right when you reach the cover, and then possibly Enyala (Enyala will hopefully take her time about this though, and if you're lucky she may not even advance at all). Even if she does advance on your cover position, you should be able to recharge your shields safely in the crook of the L cover while focusing her down without fear of any other enemies flanking you (the exception to this being any drones summoned by the Eclipse Operative which you should take down immediately). The last major threat after the asari are down is the Operative, but aside from the drones he summons he isn't an imminent threat, just wear him down like the others.
Both of these jambs aren't solid and you can hide in either one; the one on the right tends to work best. Your squad is just out of luck if you go for this.
Alternative Strategy: There is another strategy that revolves around exploiting a glitch in the map architecture. Squadmates are expendable distractions only, they won't reliably survive so just plan on them waking up after you've cleared all hostiles. Run inside the orange-colored elevator and face out. There are two rectangular columns on either side wall of the elevator that aren't solid—it's possible to clip through them and hide inside. Enemies just stop shooting at you and even enemy drones when launched will come up to the column where you are and just wait until they die. While inside the columns, you can use powers and shoot guns with the exception of sniper rifles; something about the extended zoom of a sniper rifle causes the shot to fail. The enemy mercs will work their way up to the cover in front and to the right of the elevator doorway. The best strategy is to move out of the column, fire a weapon and use a power, and then move back into the column to recharge your shields. Every enemy can eventually be worn down, though remember that Enyala, the asari Vanguard, and the Eclipse Operative can all recharge their shielding with their Tech Armor once any armor they possess is gone, so try and disable them and kill them outright to prevent this. A final note of caution: you won't able to pick up any dropped thermal clips easily with this strategy so aim well.
After eliminating all opposition, Miranda tells you to hurry up so that you can intercept Oriana to ensure her safety. Search the far right of the dock for medi-gel, acquire 3,000 credits from a computer, and retrieve a lost locket for an asari near the dock's exit, which starts a final cutscene to end the mission.
Upon reaching at the designated floor, you will see Oriana with her family from a distance. Miranda is happy that Oriana can live a normal life. Miranda decides to leave, but you can convince her to meet Oriana and her family or respect Miranda's decision to leave them be.
Normandy[]
Oriana and her family
Once you return to the Normandy, you can approach Miranda for her account of the meeting she had with Oriana on Illium. Miranda says that Oriana’s family was shocked from learning the truth, but Oriana adjusted quickly to that knowledge. Miranda is happy to know that Oriana has a normal life and family, in contrast to her own upbringing.
If Miranda was not convinced to reveal herself to Oriana, she is less upbeat, but still satisfied that Oriana's safety is assured.
Confrontation with Jack[]
See also: Loyalty#Confrontations
If you have already completed Jack's loyalty mission, you will automatically return to the Normandy on mission completion. Joker will page Shepard over the PA saying that Jack just went to have a talk with Miranda. When Shepard decides to handle it, Joker jokingly replies, “Take pictures.” Shepard arrives in Miranda’s office only to find Jack flinging a chair across the room and Shepard tells them both to knock it off. Jack is furious that Miranda will not admit to what Cerberus did to her was wrong. Unless you have enough Paragon or Renegade points, you cannot end this situation without alienating one or the other crew member. If you have enough points, then you earn the loyalty of both crew members and can continue any relationships that you have started. If you fail, then you will lose out on any relationships with either one and her loyalty, depending on whom you alienate.
The amount of morality points required also varies during the course of the game, due to how Mass Effect 2's Charm/Intimidate system works. You need a high percentage of the Paragon or Renegade points obtainable from the areas that you've explored in order to pass the persuasion check; the amount of the meter that is filled in does not provide an accurate indication of whether Charm or Intimidate will be possible.
Email[]
If you convince Miranda to talk to Oriana, she will send Shepard a message titled ""Guardian angels"":
From: Oriana (Lawson)

I hope this is the right Commander Shepard. I'm Oriana. My sister only told me a little, but I don't think it occurred to her that I'm as smart as she is. I poked around a little and found an information broker who got me this address.

I got to thank her, but I never got to thank you for helping me. My parents don't really understand it, but I know how much Miranda did, how many little things over the years were her looking out for me. I'm not going to tell them. I still want to go to school and get some degrees. But I wanted you to know that I know you saved me.

I had a guardian angel all these years. I don't know if my sister has anybody. She said that she's working for you, and it was pretty clear that you were doing something dangerous. Make sure she comes back alive, okay?

-Oriana

PS: Don't tell her I sent you this. It would just make her angry.

PPS: Miranda, quit looking at Shepard's messages. Oh, don't act like you don't. It's what I'd do.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Dossier:_The_Convict,"Prerequisite: Freedom's Progress (mission)
This mission is acquired after the mission to Freedom's Progress.
Jack (no last name known)

- Exceptional biotic ability
- Note: Criminal background, currently in custody

Jack is rumored to be the most powerful human biotic ever encountered. Very little additional data regarding Jack is available, except that the subject has a history of violence and should be approached carefully. Currently, Jack is being held on the turian prison ship Purgatory. Cerberus has negotiated for the prisoner's release.","Arrival[]
The mission starts with a cutscene of the Normandy's arrival, and Purgatory's commander watching the event then preparing to welcome the visitors. When you gain control simply approach the trio of Blue Suns mercs at the end of the corridor to trigger a conversation. As this is supposed to be a simple transaction, you won't be able to draw weapons and shoot anything for now.
They run a tight ship, or so it seems
The guards will ask you to surrender your weapons. Whichever way you answer, you'll refuse. The turian station commander, Warden Kuril, enters and explains that it's ""standard procedure"". Again, you will refuse. Both refusals come with opportunities to gain Renegade morality points depending on how strongly you feel about the issue. Invariably Kuril relents and allows you to proceed, telling his guards that they are well equipped to handle three armed guests.
Kuril will take you on a small walkthrough of the facility. You are in Cellblock Two, and he explains how each pod is a self-contained cell that can be ejected if necessary. You can see giant arms moving cells and it moves three onto the walkway further along. Kuril touts Purgatory's other features and boasts that nothing goes wrong here. You can then investigate what he knows about Jack, his backstory, and the expense his operation must be costing.
When you tell Kuril to keep moving one of your squadmates will raise concerns about escape attempts, which Kuril then downplays because there are limited opportunities to do so in space. You then see another demonstration of Purgatory's crowd-control tech, which will be relevant in the inevitable battles ahead, so take note. Kuril then informs you to proceed to Outprocessing, while he leaves to confirm if the credits for Jack's release have been transferred.
The relationship between prisoner and guard never changes no matter the century or setting
Once you have control again, walk down the one-way hallway and you'll arrive at three prisoner cells. The first cell has two guards, one standing outside and another beating a prisoner inside his cell. The next two cells house Prisoner 780 and Prisoner 403. These are optional interactions though you may gain further understanding of the situation if you investigate.
You can talk to the guard outside the first cell and either agree with what they're doing or order them to stop. Morality points may be gained from the conversation. On the next cell, Prisoner 780 calls you over and wants you to buy him as well, but when he learns you're here for Jack he immediately changes his mind. He can also explain what's the deal with Bimmy, the prisoner being beaten next to him, as well as some inside details on how the prison really works. On the last cell, Prisoner 403 claims he can hear the screaming in his head, and it's nice. Clearly he's off his rocker, so move on.
Not even bothering to clean up bloodstains is one big red flag
After going through the door, you see a fork in the walkways. In front of you is the door to Outprocessing. The alternate route leads to the supermax wing and a guard says it's off-limits for now, so ignore it.
The technician at the entrance to Outprocessing tells you to go to the door at the end of the room. As you open the door, it reveals a cell. A cutscene plays where the Warden comes over the intercom and tells Shepard that they are too valuable to leave the station without a price tag. If you learned about his motivations earlier, you can call him out on the hypocrisy. Whatever you tell him though, Kuril is in no mood to listen and activates the prison's systems. On the upside, all responses yield morality points. Finally you're able to bring out your guns: prepare for combat.
An autosave is generated when you open the door. Since events immediately lead to a fight, loading it will take you to the moment before you open the door.
Betrayal[]
As the saying goes, never trust a turian without facepaint - this guy has lots so he probably can be trusted to kill you
Once the cutscene with the devious Warden ends, get your squad into cover and target the door you came in as mercs will come guns blazing: 3 Blue Suns Troopers (2 humans 1 turian), and a Blue Suns Centurion. These four are followed by a Blue Suns Legionnaire, 2 FENRIS Mechs, and 2 more Troopers (1 human 1 turian).
Combat Tips: The ambush gives you no time to prepare you team for combat, but you should still remember to take a moment to activate ammo powers to maximize your damage. Enemies bottleneck themselves as they come through the door, so heavy weapon fire can devastate them, and you'll get plenty of refills later. Using the M-622 Avalanche to disable the initial wave can buy you plenty of breathing room.
Order your squad into cover and head there yourself immediately. The dog-mechs will try to harass you: prioritize them before they compromise your cover position. After them, the turians with shotguns are the next most likely to get you into trouble. Once the mercs are dead, gather up thermal clips and move out the door: the way you came in is locked, so you have to go to the aforementioned supermax wing.
Move your squadmates up to the first support pillars on either side to provide cover and take cover yourself, either behind the crate or at the entrance to the tube. Big surprise: more mercs will try to take you down: a Legionnaire and three turian Troopers. There is no real reason that you should move your squadmates or yourself, as the mercs will just usually come at you, though in Mass Effect Legendary Edition they sometimes bizarrely all run away back to the room they start from.
Pick up the clips once the mercs are down and enter the control booth for the supermax wing. The Technician inside comms his buddies that you are on the loose, so deal with him violently. The room has refined element zero (+500 units), a medical station next to a locked door (for now), and a console for accessing Purgatory's security controls.
Jack gets ready to take out three YMIR mechs. If only she did that in every battle!
As you access the console, your squadmates tell you that this will override the security for the whole prison. It's also the only way to bring Jack out of cryostasis. You complete the procedure, and the cutscene goes on to show Jack's cell being pulled out of the ground. One of your squadmates will react incredulously when they see a highly feared and dangerous criminal is a skinny bald tattooed woman. She revives, seemingly angry at her incarceration. The three YMIR Mechs guarding her cell are apparently no deterrent for her, as she breaks her restraints, unleashes her massive biotic powers on the YMIRs, and escapes. Now, it's a chase.
The Chase Begins[]
Once you regain control, the previously locked door is now accessible. Run past it and down the ramp to where Jack was. You'll find that she has blasted a hole in the wall and the YMIR Mechs are in ruins. Turns out she demolished four YMIRs instead of just three. Before going through the hole, scan the YMIR Mech at the back for an Ablative VI damage protection upgrade.
All Purgatory just broke loose...
The hole leads to a hallway with dead prison guards and some items. Kuril bellows over loudspeaker mobilizing the rest of the guards and authorizing lethal force. He still wants Jack alive though, and orders his techs to commence facility lockdown.
The computer tells you a little further along that some cellblocks have decompressed, with no survivors. It will regularly update you later on the destruction running through the station. Moving along the hallway, take the power cells and loot the dead guard farther down for 1,500 credits. If you attempt to backtrack EDI informs you that the Warden has locked the area behind you, so you have no choice but to go forward. Once you reach another hole, walk through it and into a scene of destruction.
The next location is the prison's common area you saw earlier, only this time you're on the ground instead of the walkways above. The three prison cells you passed earlier are heavily damaged, and there's no word on the fates of their occupants. The scene bears all the signs that someone came through in a fit of rage.
The Human Prisoners are out of their cells and are actively attacking their jailers with pistols they somehow got their hands on. Either group would also be equally happy to attack you and your squad, and from across the room a YMIR Mech waits to join the fray as soon as you walk onto the bridge in front of you. You now have a couple strategies available:
When inmates told you to watch your ass on the showers they didn't mean you'll be dodging mass-accelerated bullets and lumbering mechs
Let Them Duke It Out: Since the prisoners are actively fighting their jailers you have two options here. One is to leave your squadmates in cover/squatting down in the passageway to let the two factions fight it out, so that they don't get killed before you move into this section. Don't cross the bridge in front of you as this triggers the YMIR mech (as noted above). Use your radar and listen to see if the merc / prisoner battle is over. When you are ready, dash out onto the bridge to trigger the YMIR and the mercs but run back to the left quickly. Take cover on the large container looking thing to the left of the bridge. If you do this correctly, the YMIR will walk down the spillway towards the bridge on the lower level and stop / get hooked right below where Shepard is in cover. The YMIR will look upwards stomping and trying to get to Shepard but can't. The mercs will be in shower stalls below but can't get to Shepard either. Reposition / change the view of Shepard as needed carefully in cover so that you can get a target lock on the YMIR below. Carefully snipe / use powers to chip away at the YMIR mech located below and soon it will fall. Incinerate works great for this as Shepard can throw it over the bridge railing right into the YMIR's face. Don't go rushing out yet as the mercs are still in cover below. Eliminate them from cover before you continue on.
Help The Prisoners: Since the prisoners are a bit outgunned and out-armored, they won't last very long against the mercs by themselves. This raises the opportunity of actively intervening on their behalf, distracting and disabling the Blue Suns while the prisoners focus on them as well. If you do this optimally, you will have as many as two prisoners still alive when you activate the YMIR by walking onto the bridge, and thus the prisoners can now distract the YMIR on your behalf giving you extra time to pound on its shields and armor before it is actively sending missiles your way. If you somehow manage to eliminate the YMIR with the prisoners are still alive, give yourself a pat on the back but now they will ungratefully turn on you so gun them down mercilessly and move onto the next room.
When everything is down, move from cover and collect clips. Cross the bridge at the very back and hack the dead guard's datapad at the top for 4,500 credits. On the way out, scan the shotgun for a Synchronized Pulsar research upgrade. Once in the U-shaped corridor between the cellblocks, loot the medi-gel, and access the datapad for 4,500 credits. Save your game and open the door into the next cellblock.
Tip: In the section in between cell blocks, do not pick up the power cells immediately unless you really need them. You will be able to return here during the subsequent fight, and since picking up the power cells will immediately restore your other ammo as well, this can be a big help in facing the upcoming fight.
The cell blocks look nearly identical
The next cellblock is full of Blue Suns. The first four are 3 Troopers (2 humans 1 turian) and a Legionnaire. Move your squadmates into cover: the thing on the floor across from you is a pop-up cover, so just move a squadmate or yourself near it and it will deploy. There are a few of these in this room so be on the lookout for them. There is an explosive container along the wall of prison cells and the two human Troopers usually hang around that area, so shoot it when opportunity comes.
Once they're all down move to the sturdy shower stalls in the trench and remain there while you take out the next group of Blue Suns, consisting of 3 Troopers (1 human 2 turians) and a Legionnaire. Do NOT proceed under the bridge yet, as that will activate the YMIR mech at the far side of the room.
Sometimes the YMIR will activate during your fight—for example if you or your squadmates accidentally hit it where it sits dormant on the far bridge. It will also activate if you spawn a Combat Drone beyond the bridge, but a combat drone merely moving past the bridge will not have this effect. In these cases you may need to beat a temporary retreat to the original cover. If you beat the second group of Blue Suns without activating the YMIR you may have a moment to gather ammo, but as soon as you head underneath or to the upper section alongside it the YMIR will activate along with yet another group of Blue Suns: 2 Troopers (1 human 1 turian), and a human Centurion. Followed by the real last group in the area: 3 human Troopers and a turian Centurion.
Mechs and organics alike don't have complex pathing AI so they seldom think to go around if you force them to target you through the narrow slit
Combat Strategy: Once the YMIR triggers (you'll be able to hear the mechanical stomping getting louder even if you can't see it right away) the most careful way to handle it is to simply retreat back to where you first entered this cellblock, as the YMIR is unable to follow you up onto the entry platform. There is a large central pillar reaching up to the ceiling; park your squad back here so they won't expose themselves to the YMIR and use their abilities to help you chip away at the YMIR. Just peek out around the left edge of the pillar carefully and work the mech down gradually with weapons and powers; alternately if you go all the way back towards the right side wall behind the pillar, there is a small gap between the pillar and what looks like some kind of cylindrical tank; it's possible to hit the YMIR from this gap as well. Most Blue Suns still alive shouldn't follow you all the way back here either but if they do, take them out first. If you saved the power cells in the previous hallway you'll have all the ammo refills you should need, and even if you didn't, there will be more up ahead.
However you chose to deal with the mech and mercs, don’t forget to grab 1,500 credits from the dead Blue Suns soldier on your way to the next hallway. Over loudspeaker Kuril is getting desperate in trying to find Jack, and later he orders all guards to Cellblock One. This hallway has a medical station, power cells, and a wall safe for bypass (3,000 credits). Collect from each and BEFORE opening the door, save your game. Once you open this door you will not be able to return to this area.
The Warden[]
It's time to kill prisoner scum and chew bubblegum. The Warden's all out of gum.
Opening the door this time gives a cutscene where Warden Kuril is using his M-76 Revenant to cut down rioting prisoners. Then he happens to notice you, and mentions that while he could not take Shepard, he will still recapture Jack. Take him down before he has a chance to carry through on that threat. It isn't that simple, though, because he's protected by a shield whose generators must be destroyed to disable it. It's not only good for separating quarreling prisoners, it's also good at providing bossfight protection. Shooting at Kuril at this point is just a waste of ammo.
Once the cutscene ends, take cover behind the crates ahead of you. The three shield generators powering Kuril's shield are on the lower level ahead of you, and on the upper level to your left and to your right. The center and left ones can be taken out from your initial cover site ahead of you; the right one is a little trickier. Initial merc troops are a Legionnaire and two human Troopers defending the shield generator at the shower stalls.
Note:  Successfully hitting the shield generators with powers will instantly disable them, but shooting them requires a certain amount of ""damage"" to be done, per a red health bar that will be shown when you focus on one of them while close enough. Generators can only be shot out by hitting them in the center near the glowing blue lights. An accurate weapon such as the M-5 Phalanx, the M-12 Locust (with slow, deliberate shots), the M-96 Mattock, or any sniper rifle can pick them off at any range, and it's possible to hit all of the generators without venturing too far from your start position.
Having the same gun as the boss is apparently one way to earn a promotion
A combination of the following will spawn from either of the two doors in the area, including the one you came in: human Troopers, human or turian Centurions, and/or a Blue Suns Commander, with 2-3 per wave. They do so after the destruction of the first two generators, and a short while later both are followed up with a secondary wave. Enemy spawning is time-delayed, and destruction of the third generator cancels enemy spawns, even pending previous ones, so destroying all three generators in quick succession can minimize the total number of enemies. The armored Commander only appears from the north door (on your right from your initial position), unlike the others. Keep an eye on the hostiles wherever you are during the fight in order to prevent surprise visitors on the flank. They will generally spawn at the furthest point from you (not your squad) so the best way to prevent an enemy from entering from where you did is to stand near there when destroying generators. In the absence of further hostiles, your squadmates will default to targeting Kuril but of course this is moot until all generators are disabled.
You can take two general approaches:
Slow and Steady: Option one is you can fight your way through several long but predictable waves of spawning minions and then plan to deal with Kuril separately. To proceed with this strategy, you can now take out the nearby shield generator by shooting it when you see the glowing blue power cell. A new wave of mercs will spawn. Once you take out those mercs, you can knock down another shield generator, triggering a final wave of mercs. When you've taken them out you can then knock down the third generator and face Kuril all by himself. From your initial position, you have free rein to deal with either left or right generators. The left generator is partly inaccessible because of barricades facing your direction. With a little aiming, you can disable it from where you're standing, or you can run up to it and shoot it up close.
Fast and Furious: Option two is, once you've taken out most of the initial set of mercs—at least the three down in lower section—assign your squad to cover while you rush around to knock down all three shield generators early on, which stops the spawning of enemies. To minimize the danger, move up and knock out the shield generator on the right hand side first, then quickly run back down toward the starting point to knock down the center shield generator. Finally, move up to the left side and take cover, possibly leaving a squad member assigned to the starting area to cover your flank. Then take out the third generator to stop any more mercs from spawning. Kuril now joins the fight, but he doesn't have a very long range, plus you get the option to take him out early, instantly ending the mission without the need to take out any remaining mercs.
Your team starts off at the right, near the set of crates, and the area provides numerous cover opportunities for both you and your adversaries
The left area (marked by the ""STAND CLEAR"" warning on the floor) is studded with barricades that pop up on approach, offering lots of protection from enemies that will be coming in from the far right. The right area has a bridge with flimsy cover, and you will be required to quickly neutralize any mercs at the other end and steal their cover boxes if you want to live. Fortunately, the right shield generator is within shooting distance even from the bridge and you can simply shoot it when you're secure.
No matter which direction you choose, once you've taken down the Warden’s shield, the mercs will stop coming through the large door and you'll now be faced with the Warden himself plus any remaining minions. Kuril has health, armor, and shields for defense once the generated shield is down; once he's dead the mission immediately ends so you can try to eliminate him while ignoring any other mercs, but the safest route is to methodically eliminate all the other threats first. The best time to hit him is when he pops up or starts to go back into cover. Once Kuril's shields and armor are down, biotics like Pull or Throw can disable or even instantly kill him by knocking him off his perch.
Caution: When playing as an Engineer, be aware that summoning a Combat Drone deep in enemy territory during this battle can sometimes focus the entire mass of Blue Suns infantry on Shepard, causing them to bum rush your cover position and overwhelm you at close range. Keeping squad members deployed between Shepard and said enemies will prevent or mitigate this effect.
Note: It is possible to charge and fire the M-920 Cain immediately upon entering the room. A well-aimed shot will instantly kill Kuril and end the confrontation without needing to destroy any of the generators, as its blast ignores intervening terrain and other obstacles.
Once the Warden falls, regardless of how many Blue Suns are left, the penultimate mission cutscene will start. An autosave is generated here.
Escape and the Normandy[]
""You sound like a pussy.""
Jack, however, has also been busy and has reached the airlock. The guards try to stop her, but her biotics take them down before they have a chance to even raise their weapons. Apparently, the large ship out the window draws Jack's interest, but she spots the Cerberus logo on the Normandy's bow planes. That sends her into a fit, allowing a batarian guard to sneak up on her, but before the guard can do anything he gets a shot in the head from Shepard's pistol. Jack spins around, and a conversation begins.
If you have Jacob and/or Miranda, there are a few interesting comments from Jack during the conversation. You can earn a few morality points based on your conversation options: Jack wants access to Cerberus files aboard the ship; Miranda and Jacob think it's a bad idea. You will respond that you'll give her access in the exact same tone regardless of whether you were being honest or bluffing. Either way, Jack deems the matter settled and badgers your team why they're still standing about.
Back on the Normandy, Miranda formally introduces herself and her role to Jack regardless of whether she was on the mission or not. Jack demands immediate access to the files, and you can either give them to her right away or tell her to settle in first. Either decision results in the last morality points for the mission. From the get-go Jack has developed a dislike for the ""cheerleader"" and will rub it in Miranda's face when you do something to support Jack's aims.
Jack then leaves the briefing room to settle at the lowest point on the ship. In between missions and assignments you can find her down the stairs outside Main Engineering on Deck 4."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Horizon_(mission),"Prerequisite: Dossier: Archangel , Dossier: The Convict, Dossier: The Professor, and Dossier: The Warlord
After recruiting Archangel, Jack, and Mordin Solus, as well as recovering the tank from Korlus (note that waking up the krogan inside is not necessary), Shepard will be unable to select a new destination for the Normandy. If you attempt to access the Galaxy Map, both Kelly Chambers and Joker will inform you that the Illusive Man wants a chat. Go to the FTL comm room to talk to him and begin this mission.","Mission Briefing[]
Nothing says idyllic more than giant guns amid pastoral fields
The Illusive Man gives Shepard information about the mission. Horizon has recently gone silent, a telltale indicator of Collector attack. He also informs you one of your former teammates is on the planet: Ashley Williams or Kaidan Alenko, depending on the decision in Mass Effect (or whoever you specified to be rescued in a non-import game). The former teammate is there on behalf of an Alliance outreach program, though the Illusive Man suspects it's about something else. Respond whichever way you like, there are no morality points here.
After talking with the Illusive Man, Shepard walks to Mordin's Tech Lab to ask him if he has developed a countermeasure to the seeker swarms. He says yes and shows Shepard the schematics.
Horizon Before Normandy's Arrival[]
Unwanted houseguests
Horizon had been recently fitted with GARDIAN laser turrets which were provided by the Alliance to defend the colony. The turrets, however, could not be calibrated correctly. While Shepard's former squadmate is talking with one of the colonists, Lilith, about the issue, the Collector Cruiser drops into the atmosphere. The colony's communications blackout has been caused by the Collectors, and the seeker swarms are released.
The Virmire survivor will try to provide cover but ends up getting stung and incapacitated. The colonists run for cover as the swarms sting more and more people, including Lilith.
Arrival On Horizon[]
Landing on Horizon, your journal updates two missions: this one and Stop the Collectors. The former is the actual mission, the latter is the overarching plot of the game. You also gain a codex entry on the planet.
You begin on the outskirts of the colony, in the middle of the Collector invasion. Move a few steps forward and your team will talk about the efficacy of Mordin's seeker swarms countermeasures. It seems to work, since none of you are stung. Further ahead is some sort of truck loading dock, prepare for a fight as the first few Collectors fly in: 2 Collector Guardians, 1 Collector Assassin, and 2 Collector Drones (1 initial, 1 reinforcement).
Conveniently placed breakables and explosives, truly unexpected game design
Move carefully between cover locations for good angles and take out the attacking Collectors one by one. Even though all Collector soldiers look very similar you will be engaging several distinct types: the basic Drones, and the much tougher and more damaging Guardians and Assassins. Assassins unleash deadly particle beams, while the Guardians fire powerful rifles at you from behind their pop-up circular shields that may remind you of the hexagonal barriers used by the geth in the first Mass Effect game. Employ situational awareness as the area has a bunch of explosive materials and fragile yellow crates: shoot the former when Collectors are nearby, shoot the latter when the bugs take cover behind them.
The loading dock has a box of power cells. Further ahead, there's a hackable datapad on the picnic table (6,000 credits). Loot them now or during the fight (for the power cells at most) since the next area has a dropoff point of no return.
As you move to the next location, Joker tries to radio but there's too much interference. You and your team are on your own now. The next area that you come across will have several buildings around, and Collectors who just happened to be harvesting.
PROTIP: instead of a suicidal frontal fight use the buildings provided for divide and conquer
The fight consists of an Assassin, a Drone, and a Guardian. The Collector escorting the floating pod as you arrive is a Guardian; if it moves out of sight before you trigger hostilities, another one flies in to replace it. You'll also encounter something else that you may recognize from the first Mass Effect: Husks, three of them. This time they only have melee attacks, so take them out from a distance; biotics are effective as is shooting their lower halves. An additional two Drones arrive at the scene to replace two Collectors you shoot down.
A good way to end this fight quickly is to take refuge in the building to the right of where you come in. It has two windows to shoot out of, you and your squad are much more protected from long-range fire than anywhere else nearby, and you can funnel the husks into following inside for easier disposal (the Collectors are coded to keep distance and thus always engage from outside).
Once all enemies fall, your team talks about the husks. Their presence confirms the Collectors are working for the Reapers. Lootables in the area are a datapad in the building (4,200 credits) and a Heavy Skin Weave upgrade, scannable from a dead Collector underneath a giant tree.
""More advanced"" but lost the first game's electrical attack? Doesn't compute
Be sure to take everything you need from the area before departing. When you move forward between this region and the next you'll see a dead husk on the ground: interacting with it or attempting to move past it will trigger a cutscene, and seal the previous area behind. Shepard will describe how they are different from the ones encountered before (specifically Eden Prime if you imported your Mass Effect game). Shepard and the squad realize that the Collectors must have come with these husks and not created them on-site. As time is of the essence, Shepard orders the squad to press on in hopes of preventing any more abductions. Either of your responses to get going will yield the first morality points for the mission. An autosave is also generated afterward.
As you enter the next area your squad talks about the lack of people or empty buildings (there are people around, but you'll have to take a closer look at the numerous pods here...). It's a housing complex with multiple enterable prefabs. Unfortunately, your radar picks up hostiles even if you don't see any at first, so prepare for a fight.
See how effective Collector weapons are against good ol' human colonist walls?
The initial hostiles consist of three Drones (1 on the balcony of a house, 1 on the ground next to it, 1 inside the house adjacent to it), an Assassin, and a Guardian (standing together at first). As before, the empty buildings exist for a reason, and for now it's to provide cover for your team. There are three of them, and two are near or occupied by Collectors, so run to the truly empty one in front of your entrance and set up positions by the windows. It's the one with a wall safe you can bypass (4,800 credits), loot that later when it's more peaceful. If you're careful your squad won't immediately shoot while running to this house, preserving the element of surprise in your favor and rewarding you with high ground.
Sometimes they're dumb enough to shoot the canisters themselves
The direction you'll go to is generally northward, towards the giant tree between the houses. West of the tree is an elevated platform with numerous explosive canisters. 3-5 Drones emerge from this area (1-3 already there, 1 from an upstairs building, 1 from the staircase below the upstairs building) and may spillover to the previous battlefield if they detect you or the fighting. Again, numerous explosive canisters: make them go boom.
Once all these hostiles are eliminated you can resume looting without fear of ambush, for now. Aside from the aforementioned wall safe, there's a Med Kit in the house with an initial Drone on the balcony.
When you enter the area with a staircase next to the explosive platform and behind one of the three houses, you can examine a pair of colonists in stasis. You and a squadmate have some comments on this. The house above them has a free thermal clip and a hackable computer (3,000 credits).
Going down and proceeding west, you'll see a somewhat open field in the distance strewn with Collector pods, beyond which looms an offline GARDIAN turret. There's a Collector Particle Beam heavy weapon near one of the many Collector pods. Picking up the Particle Beam will also totally refill your heavy weapon ammo if you are not at full capacity so you may want to use that strategically. If you miss or ignore it here, it may also be found in two other instances on this mission (see its page) or it will be awarded automatically at its conclusion. Once you are ready, save your game and move into the next area.
""Assuming Control Of This Form""
You have two ways forward: by the building next to you, or straight ahead. When you reach the vague boundary denoted by the two occupied pods straight ahead, or upon descending the steps in the adjacent building, a brief cutscene plays showing more Collector troopers arriving as airborne infantry, and the Collector General assuming control of one. Here, Shepard will encounter Harbinger for the first time. An autosave is generated here that loads back to the beginning of the cutscene.
The fight initially consists of Harbinger, 2 Drones (1 in the main battlefield, 1 in the side corner to the left from where you begin), and a Guardian. An Assassin emerges from the accessible door at the back of the open area, or if you venture to around halfway the length of the lefthand raised platform in the open area (facing the GARDIAN tower), though there are explosive containers there which can significantly reduce the Assassin's health if the timing is perfect. Another 2 Drones fly in as reinforcements when you eliminate the first wave. A final 2 Drones and a Guardian fly in afterward under most scenarios, though in some battlefield states (like when you never entered the open field and killed all hostiles from long-range) they may fail to materialize.
In light of the massive firepower you'll face, you can try your luck with crouching cover behind the two occupied Collector pods, though Harbinger's attacks can quickly stagger you or your squadmates out of any cover you huddle in (Note:  Open pods cannot be used as cover). While Harbinger is a priority threat, killing it early may just cause it to return in another Collector. Make a spot judgement call whether to take down all enemies beside it first, on a targeted basis (kill weaker Drones, then Harbinger, then it will be forced to return in the remaining Guardian or Assassin and eliminating the threats these two possess), or ""come what may"". Taking cover by the building to your left is sub-optimal because of poor vantage points, but could work situationally, especially if you're willing to spend time opening the door, peeking out, shooting, closing the door, ad nauseam.
For a technologically superior species that can fly, somehow they never learned to ascend stairs
If you have good aiming skills and/or accurate long-range weaponry, you can try taking positions along the covered guardrails of the building labeled 6, to your right when facing the GARDIAN tower. Lower floor or upper floor will do fine. The hostiles never cross the boundary threshold between the two aforementioned occupied pods and another one in front of them, so with some dodging you can also whittle them off whenever they appear on your sights. Harbinger can still throw staggering attacks your way, though the likelihood of dying to massed gunfire is reduced due to the well-protected positions. About 30 cm or 1 ft from the rails is a good enough distance that's out of reach from the staggering attack while still allowing you to shoot at the targets below, although that comes at cost of a more obstructed sightline. Still, stay off the railings whenever Harbinger unleashes one.
Another position that favors long-range weapons is all the way to the back. Around the area with the frozen colonists you can interact with earlier, the Collectors simply stop shooting even if you're right in front of them. You also lose their targeting boxes, but they can still be shot at and killed at that range. This goes both ways, as your squadmates cannot target the enemies at that range, although if you park them there you can still use their powers while you stay in front to do the dodging and killings.
Once no more enemies are flying in, you can now safely loot the area. The lower level of the building labeled 6 has a computer with free 3,000 credits. The building where the Assassin emerged (labeled 9) has power cells. Bypass the large door to the north, and loot everything you need before going in because the area behind you will seal up afterward.
Garage[]
Cowards live longer, ungrateful cowards even more so unfortunately
Once you move inside far enough you encounter an unharmed colonist, the local mechanic, Delan. You can get some information about the attack, where your former squadmate is, what towers were installed and his anger at the Alliance, and you can earn some morality points as well. You determine from the conversation that the GARDIAN laser towers are the key to destroying the Collector ship. Once you are done talking he will tell you to move to the spaceport to get the towers operational. He unlocks the door to your destination, but warns he locks it again after you pass through.
You gain a Codex entry for the Collector General at the end of the conversation.
Delan's hideout has a lot of handy stuff: a Weapons Locker if you want to reconfigure your loadouts, a wall safe with 6,000 credits, a Med Kit, a free thermal clip, and 2,000 platinum. An autosave is generated as you leave, though for extra safety of mind you can manually save your game as well. Note that switching heavy weapons in the locker will give you a fresh one with full ammo.
Get to the Spaceport[]
Good cover places: the obstacles southeast and the stairs (just watch for flankers from the back)
The next area is another housing complex, denser than the previous one, and beyond it is the spaceport. But first, you have to get past a gauntlet of bad guys: a Guardian and a Drone in the plaza, with Harbinger possessing a Drone entering from the walkway leading to the back portion of the area. Three Husks plus an Assassin proceed to the elevated mini-plaza adjacent to them, dropping from the roof of the structure behind the place and flying in respectively (there's an explosive canister near them), and a Scion follows up from where Harbinger came in when most of the first wave has been eliminated.
One way to approach this conundrum would be divide and conquer. The husks and Harbinger will chase you, so lead them into areas Collector gunfire can't reach: inside the nearest building from your starting position, the walkway around and behind this building, or even by the giant heavy-duty-looking boxes right outside the garage. Following this, it's a matter of patience wearing down the rest of the Collectors.
A Scion has a powerful ranged attack similar to Shockwave, but it moves really slowly. If you remain behind the low thick wall that first separates you from the area with the Collectors, Harbinger's slow singularity-type attack will not be as effective at knocking you out of cover, and you will have a good vantage point to take it out along with its lesser minions. If Harbinger or the Scion is about to come around the wall, run back to the farm equipment props outside the garage and circle around them as necessary. It is usually best to save the Scion for last because of its toughness and slow movement rate. It can be tough to keep your squadmates alive against it but they will revive after you've cleared the area and the Scion is the last major hurdle so consider saving your medi-gel if they do go down.
This alley on the building to the left of your starting position is one of the places good for baiting husks
Tip: If you have Kasumi in your party, her Flashbang Grenade can be used to temporarily prevent Harbinger from using biotic abilities, giving you plenty of space to kill it; this works even if Harbinger's barriers are full, and lasts considerably longer than the power's duration and even cooldown time, meaning that through repeated uses you can completely suppress Harbinger's warp and singularity attacks, leaving it only with its gun (which is never fired). Against the Scion, Flashbang has no effect; however, Kasumi's Shadow Strike power can momentarily distract it.
Once the enemies have fallen, you get a Codex entry for the Scion. This area is the proverbial quiet before the storm, so stock up on thermal clips if need be. There are power cells on a walkway to the left of the entrance. After the walkway connecting the front and back of the area, a dead Collector that yields a Hyper-Amp research upgrade. On the upper level building labeled 7, there's a computer with 3,000 credits.
As you reach the spaceport door one of your squadmates find it odd there are no more frozen colonists: the other responds the Collectors already loaded them up their ship, so you need to hurry.
Facing the spaceport door, it is highly recommended you do a manual save. Afterward, bypass the door to behold the spaceport.
Spaceport[]
Many ways to deal with these guys (HINT: melee isn't one of them)
Be warned that the next area is very challenging regardless of difficulty and there is no turning back once you get in because the door will seal up behind you. There is nowhere else to go, you will face numerous waves of enemies, and there are very limited supplies should you run out of heavy weapon ammo or have squadmates fainting. Want to make things a bit easier? Do not move into the spaceport yet. There are two Scions in the distance, well-hidden but can still be damaged and killed from your position outside the spaceport.
To do so, move to the far right or far left side of the doorway, where you should just be able to see part of one Scion. You can now take it out without it being alerted to you. A sniper rifle is highly recommended for this as it will allow squadmate powers—as well as your own—to be aimed more effectively. A heavy pistol, Warp or Incinerate will also be effective. You can even position your squadmates on certain areas into the spaceport, where you have to manually command them to attack (Q & E on default PC bindings, and corresponding controls on consoles). After one Scion is dead, stand to the other side of the staircase to defeat the second Scion. If both Scions are defeated without detection, no Husks will spawn.
Mark this territory for your weapon cooling needs in between dodging zombies and bugs
Note:  To ensure you never run out of cooling for your guns, there are several spots in the spaceport that repeatedly spawn thermal clips. One is by the two blue trucks close to the entrance. Another is by the center of the area near the hacking terminal. Another is on the grass between the truck spot and the center spot. They take a few moments to reappear after being taken. If they don't restock during a wave, they will by the next wave, and most assuredly they will continuously respawn in the final fight.
If you want to approach the first fight without exploiting the dormant Scions: after entering the spaceport move to cover and be prepared for a husk mass attack while the Scions immediately start moving in your direction as well. You enter at the west end of the spaceport, where the back of a truck offers a possible cover location. On the south side there is less cover, though power cells are to be found up some stairs. On the north side is a balcony that provides some cover and long lines of fire, along with the spaceport's single Med Kit. Finally, at the far east end there are some L-shaped cover locations that you may soon find useful for evading Husks. If you have trouble with this fight, several proven battle plans are available:
Camping in one place is only going to get you so far
Plan A - Hiding in the Truck:  One way to deal the husks is to climb on the vehicle to the left of entrance. While the husks can follow you, with a powerful enough melee punch, you can knock them back to the ground. On top of that, the platform's location could confuse the Scions that appear until you can deal with Husks. Choosing this vehicle also means there is only one direction the Husks can attack you from—so there will be a lot of enemies in one tight space, ready to be taken out with area-of-effect powers. The principal risk of this strategy involves getting trapped in the truck with too many Husks blocking any possible escape route.
Plan B - Confuse the Husks: On Insanity it may be best to avoid getting cornered in the truck, and instead mount a ""mobile defense"" running away from husks while keeping obstacles between you and the Scions. Note that vaulting over obstacles, especially the large L-shaped covers at the far east end of the field, will force Husks to take a long circuitous route to get to you. If you end up with them coming at you from several directions at once that's usually the best solution. The very first Husk will appear, alone, on your left: if you kill it quickly and proceed clockwise around that north side, you will have more cover from the Scions than the south side offers. Once you reach the far east end, you can use the L-shaped covers to confuse the Husks for long enough to pick them off with powers and weapons before the Scions get too close.
Plan C - Nuke the Scions: If you brought the M-920 Cain along, use it to take the Scions out of the picture quickly. Simply move into the area to trigger the fight as normal and begin charging the Cain while aiming for any solid terrain near the transmitter. The resulting explosion should kill or nearly kill both Scions; finish them off and then deal with the husks which shouldn't be too hard with the threat of the Scions lifted.
If you are lucky enough with hacking that all three code segments become available without much scrolling and waiting, you will be able to skip the whole first fight with Scions and husks. Do not attempt this unless you're reasonably certain the husks and Scions won't reach you in time to interrupt.
This is most of the good cover positions in the spaceport - position yourself and your squadmates wisely
Once the enemies have fallen and before you go to the transmitter, there is a crate of heavy weapon ammo to the far right of where you came in through the doors; opposite this on the raised deck to the far left of the doors where some of the husks attacked from is a med kit. You can save either of these for later but be warned it may be more difficult to get to them as you will be in near constant combat for the rest of the mission.
Once you are ready, hack the transmitter. Shepard will ask EDI to realign the lasers and bring them online. However, there is a hitch: the lasers will take time to charge, so you have to defend the tower. Prepare for a hard fight.
Defend the Tower[]
This fight is challenging because enemies will attack in multiple waves from multiple locations. There are a total of three waves that you will have to fight off:
The first wave consists of two Husks, a Collector Assassin, a Guardian, several Drones, and Harbinger. They will initially spawn toward the southeast end, between the power cells and the L-shaped covers.
The second wave will contain a Guardian, two more Drones, and tends to spawn at the northeast end, between the balcony with the medical kit and the L-shaped covers. Harbinger will quickly take control of one of the drones; he will be mobile and move around to try and flank you, while the Drone and Guardian take cover.
The third wave initially starts with four Husks, an Assassin, a Drone, and Harbinger. The Collectors spawn to the northwest of the area, between where you initially entered and the balcony with the medical kit. The husks will spawn from the raised balcony with the medical kit on the north, so don't be there. As you kill the Collectors they are replaced close to their original position. Between two to four replacements are made after any of the Collectors are killed.
When the going gets tough use your heavy stuff - ammo crate pictured
Combat Tips:
The most important tip about where to fight in this section is: as far as possible from where the Collectors arrive, because that gives you time to pick off any Husks before the attacks of the Collectors become too overpowering. For the first two waves, you can hold a position near the north or west side--for instance the balcony on the north with the medical kit, which gives you good lines of fire.
After the second wave one of your squadmates will make a comment. That means it's time to move. A great place to get ready for the last wave is at the far east end among the L-shaped covers. The Husks will reach you long before the Collectors.
Deal with Husks quickly in each wave, because if they reach point blank range they can knock you out of cover exposing you to deadly fire from the Collectors.
If you are crouching behind low cover, remember that Harbinger's slow singularity attack can dislodge you, so slide back and forth to keep it from finding you.
Avoid wasting time and ammo shooting out the umbrella shields of the Collector Guardians and instead try to flank them or wait for an opening.
Between each wave you'll have at least a little time to move around, grabbing ammo and changing position if desired.
Stay in cover, put your squadmates in cover and focus on keeping the enemy off your flanks.
On Insanity difficulty your squadmates, even the mighty Grunt, have a very tough time surviving while trading shots against the Collectors especially once Harbinger joins in. If you don't want to be constantly reviving them with medi-gel, keep them near you and therefore hopefully far away from the Collectors. If they're especially frail, you can put them completely out of the line of fire and only use them for their powers while you do the heavy lifting.
If you brought the Cain, it's your call to use it if you're getting swamped or if you still want to reserve it for the very last confrontation of the mission—somewhat like a mini-boss—following these waves, in which case you should probably save the power cells in the spaceport for grabbing after use. Remember that certain enemies like Harbinger, Husks, and the Scions can stun you and interrupt attempts to fire the Cain.
EDI will keep you up to date on the status of the lasers, and once they reach 100 percent, you know the fight is almost over. However, there is one more problem.
The Praetorian[]
A deadly foe
Once the Collectors get whittled down and the lasers are near full charge, Harbinger sends in a Praetorian. A Praetorian is a powerful enemy with strong barriers and armor, but it is the only opponent you have to deal with for this fight. It has two lethal attacks: Death Choir that also gives it full barriers, and the constant stream of particle beams it shoots from its eyes.
The basic strategy for this fight (and any fight against a Praetorian) is to play ""Ring Around the Rosie"" with it: find a piece of the environment with decent cover that you can lead it around in circles while your squadmates and you chip away at it carefully bit by bit. In this particular scenario, the three blue trucks at the spaceport center (one by itself, two side by side) have ample cover, running space, and Death Choir clearance, though if you can also make do with the stacks of tires or other platforms and crates you're more than welcome to seek them out.
Never engage this monstrosity at punching range. Always keep some distance between it and yourself, at least enough to avoid its Death Choir range (give or take 1.5x its width, in a radius). This is about patience and care, not brute force; interpose cover between yourself and the particle beams when they are firing. The Praetorian only chases and targets Shepard, so as long as your squadmates are in cover far enough away not to get hit by a Death Choir they won't go down. Just keep circling and your squad will eventually kill it in a war of attrition, though of course you should contribute damage as long as you can do so without taking too much damage or getting too close.
If the Praetorian activates its Death Choir (which happens after you inflict a lot of damage to its armor or you get too close), back up quickly to make sure you're outside the blast radius, then resume hitting it with guns and powers once it resumes its attack. Powers such as Warp or Incinerate that can arc around cover definitely come in handy here as you can hit the Praetorian without exposing yourself to return fire, but even without this it will eventually go down from your squad's fire. If ammo is a concern save it for damaging the Praetorian's armor and not its barrier which regenerates after every Death Choir attack.
If you want to use the Cain on the Praetorian, do so once its barrier is down and before it recharges. Remember that you don't need direct line of sight for the shot to be effective. Also remember to grab the power cells after firing but before the cutscene begins."

This mission becomes available after the mission on Freedom's Progress. It is part of the first group of dossiers provided by the Illusive Man.
Archangel

- Small-unit tactical expertise
- Omni-tool expert and noted sniper

Archangel is a mercenary commander whose operations are noted for their technical expertise and strategic brilliance. He is responsible for high-profile attacks on gang leaders on Omega and can likely be found there.","Prelude[]
On your very first arrival on Omega, Shepard will be instructed to speak to Aria T'Loak, the station's ruler. She tells Shepard about Archangel, a dangerous individual who has been killing large numbers of Omega's plentiful criminals. Three entire mercenary groups are preparing to kill him.
Classic player choice scenario, only this time the game forces you to decide faster
Aria directs Shepard to a small side room on the upper level of Afterlife Club to sign up for the merc mission. Speak to the Blue Suns guard, who then directs you inside. Upon entering the small room, if Shepard is female, the merc recruiter speaks in a rather condescending and presumptuous manner to her, allowing for a Renegade interrupt to set things straight. In any case, Shepard signs up as a freelancer and can thus travel deeper into the station by talking to a merc at the transportation station. Just as you leave the room, you have a chance to earn a few morality points through dialogue options and a Paragon interrupt involving a young man who plans to sign up.
Upon exiting Afterlife, a small parking lot with vehicles can be found down the promenade off to the right. A Blue Suns batarian driver is standing guard. When asked, he will take the team to Archangel's base, beginning the official mission. Warning:  This is the ""no turning back"" point, so if you had any other preparation to do on Omega, get it done first.
The new arrivals at the merc base of operations on Kima District are greeted by Salkie, who gives a preliminary overview of the situation. Speak to him for further intel or not, either way once your conversation is over you won't be able to talk to him again. He wants you to speak with Sergeant Cathka for further directions.
The merc encampment is divided roughly into three areas controlled by Eclipse, Blood Pack, and Blue Suns respectively. The direct route to Archangel is blocked by three barricades, which will force you to detour to the Eclipse area first. Note:  While you're exposed to Archangel's line of fire in the barricaded areas you can be hit by a single sniper round that will knock out your shields but do no other damage. Either of your squadmates will react with alarm when this happens, and it will continue to happen as long as you loiter within Archangel's sight. This is not a lethal threat and is only meant to remind you of your prospective recruit's skills (and to get moving).
Expect numerous lootables behind bypass-vulnerable doors
As you make your way through the merc base, you will find several items of interest and gain some options that will help you in the coming battle should you choose to avail yourself of them. EDI tells the Commander that she can find no other way to Archangel than the one the mercs plan to take on their assault, and that the mercs are using YMIR Mechs, LOKI Mechs and a gunship to pin him down. EDI recommends sabotaging them before leaving.
You will also have the opportunity to speak to the three gang leaders for their takes on the situation. As stated earlier, you'll arrive first into the Eclipse meeting room, where you find the mercs and their leader Jaroth as well as a datapad that triggers Omega: Archangel: Datapad Recovered. Speaking with Jaroth is not mandatory, and neither is visiting or speaking to the other two mercenary leaders, but doing so will provide insight into their actions as well as some more information about Archangel himself.
Sabotaging the heavy mech will yield an advantage in the upcoming battle
Outside Jaroth's room is a hallway. The adjacent door on the left is a mech room, the other leads outside of the Eclipse areas. Note:  Make sure you did everything you need to in Jaroth's room before exiting the Eclipse area, as the room locks once you access the door leading out of the area.
You can't do anything about the packed LOKIs in the mech room, but the YMIR is another matter. You'll have to bypass it to turn off its friend-or-foe targeting when Eclipse drops it into the fight later. Sabotaging the heavy mech will cause it to turn on its masters after it is unleashed on Archangel. Not sabotaging it simply makes the fight more challenging later, if that's your jam. The room also contains a crate with 500 units of eezo and a hackable datapad worth 4000 credits.
The next door brings you to another junction. The Blood Pack's waiting area is ahead of you, and though it's an optional detour, if Grunt is in the squad, there are a few interesting options with the Blood Pack Leader Garm, a Krogan Battlemaster. Garm will also reveal that Archangel is a turian.
Of course the cannon fodder only have crap kinetic barriers, if they're even given one at all
The other door leads to the Blue Suns section of the encampment: a heavily barricaded boulevard, where Archangel's lair is more visible at the distance. The vigilante himself shoots down a nearby shielded vorcha the moment you open the door, a testament to his skill and accuracy with a gun.
In front of you from the door is another vorcha corpse that has been dead longer than the freshly shot one. It's near another hackable datapad (6,000 credits). The boulevard consists of two doors, one of which is locked, and an A-61 Mantis Gunship hangar. Bypass the locked door to enter a small supply closet containing a Blue Suns weapon shipment (Submachine Gun Damage upgrade),  as well as Blue Suns gunrunning accounts (4000 credits), power cells, and some medi-gel. You can speak to a freelancer near the last barricade for directions to Cathka (who is literally across him working on the gunship).
The other door leads to the Blue Suns planning room. The waiting hall has a medi-gel dispenser and a batarian Blue Suns trooper who seems irritated you're there and not with Cathka (but won't do anything about it). The meeting room proper is full of blue-clad stressed-out mercenaries. The conversation here with the Blue Suns leader Tarak is the only one of the boss interactions that has any moral decisions—all of the others are purely for story color. If Zaeed is in the group, there is some alternate dialogue with Tarak. Either way, the batarian's second in command, Jentha, takes over for any further inquiries you may have.
Too bad it isn't actually possible to commandeer the gunship yourself
The gunship hangar is where all the freelancers hang out before being called to attack Archangel. If you didn't destroy the boy's gun before on Afterlife you can see him again here. Cathka's busy on the gunship, so you'll have to talk to his assistant first to get to him. Once you do that you're locked into going beyond the barriers, so make sure you did everything you wanted to in the previous areas before talking to Cathka.
Switching Sides[]
The conversation with Cathka can be long or short, but eventually, he will receive a signal to send in the next freelancer wave. The rest of the freelancers run out and Cathka resumes work on the gunship. A Renegade interrupt will involve Shepard taking a welder and sticking it in Cathka, rendering him unable to fully repair the gunship.
Shepard vaults over the barricade and can finally turn on the other mercs, though note that you must fire first before they turn on the squad. It's probably best to wait till the Freelancers are crowded around any of the explosive canisters in the entrance to Archangel's living room before blowing them up. Do not shoot at Archangel up on the balcony, as you will actually damage the ""Archangel Vital Signs"" bar, making the mission harder to accomplish.
Freelancers charging over the bridge
Clear out the enemies on the ground floor, and then make your way up to Archangel's location on the upper floor where you can find the last few freelancers attempting to break through the door to his sniper nest. Clear them out, and you have a moment to breathe and save your game if you like, before you actually go through the door to meet your potential new recruit. If you didn't find it already, an Omni-tool on the ground floor provides a Tech Damage (Multicore Amplifier) upgrade.
When you're ready, go through the door and a cutscene shows your team approaching Archangel from behind. Apparently unconcerned by your approach, Archangel silently motions for you to wait as he expertly snipes one remaining merc outside. He then turns and removes his helmet, revealing himself to be none other than Garrus Vakarian.
If you never recruited him to your team in the mission to stop Saren, you won't have the option of more familiar greetings that can reward some morality points, but otherwise the conversation that follows from the dialogue option on the left is the same. Garrus summarizes his history over the last few years: he resigned from C-Sec in frustration and came to Omega, where he formed and led a twelve-man vigilante band that interfered with the activities of the various merc gangs, earning him the title ""Archangel"" from the locals. Now, however, the bodies covered by orange shrouds lying in groups throughout Garrus' hideout are seemingly all that remains of his former team. Garrus promises to explain more about what happened if you all get out alive.
Cool turians don't look at explosions
Eventually talk turns to what to do next. Garrus gets up and uses the scope of his sniper rifle to see what is going on. A Renegade interrupt is briefly available when Garrus hands the rifle over to you, eliminating one of the LOKI Mechs with a headshot (the actual position of the crosshair is irrelevant). You and Garrus must now fight your way past the three mercenary groups. The Eclipse appears to be tired of waiting and attacks first.
Protect Garrus: For the upcoming battle and for most of the rest of the mission, you will need to defend Garrus against the three merc bands as they each attack his hideout in turn. A meter labeled ""Garrus Vital Signs"" will appear on your screen that shows Garrus' current level of health, and the meter level drops as he takes damage from enemies. If the meter runs out, Garrus will die and you receive a Critical Mission Failure screen. At certain discrete points during the mission, Garrus will recover an amount of his missing health. The amount of health he recovers can vary, but the bottom line is, as long as you reach one of these ""checkpoints"" with Garrus still alive, his life bar should recover enough going into the next fight that keeping him alive will remain feasible, even at the highest difficulty settings. The checkpoints are: meeting Garrus, defeating the Eclipse attack, and defeating the Blood Pack attack.
An M-15 Vindicator Battle Rifle can be picked up either before or after talking to Garrus. It is a sizable improvement over the M-8 Avenger in terms of damage and accuracy. If you want to acquire the weapon but you don't want it equipped, fear not; there will be a weapons locker in the basement where weapons can be switched after the Eclipse attack. If you're on a repeat playthrough and have already unlocked a better weapon, you can safely ignore the Vindicator, though its position on the couch can make it difficult to avoid accidentally picking it up while running back and forth for clips during the battle.
The Eclipse Attack[]
Eclipse flunkies being slaughtered with their own toy
Jaroth is getting more frustrated by the second and sends in his own troopers and LOKI mechs against your fortified position. It is advantageous to stay on the second floor, but even with SMGs this fight is not very hard, as most of the enemies stream across the bridge without taking cover. Eclipse Heavies will take cover occasionally on the sides of the bridge to cover their comrades with rockets, so you should try to take them out before they reach cover. If any mercs get into the base, you can switch from the outer edge of the balcony window to the inner edge overlooking the atrium and take them out before they reach the second floor. Garrus will warn you if Eclipse mercs manage to reach the base and the rear stairs.
Combat Tips:
You'll want to take this fight from the second floor windows as aggressively as possible to keep too many enemies from getting past you to where you can be flanked, and also because if you don't do enough to suppress the advancing mercs, Garrus can easily take too much damage. Use your most accurate weapons, and remember that shooting an enemy even a little bit tends to slow its advance. Powers that deal damage in an area like Shockwave or Singularity can also stun several targets at once.
Time your ammo runs carefully so that you aren't absent from the windows long enough for enemies to reach the other side of the bridge. There are two nearby pairs of respawning ammo cartridges—one on an end-table by the couch where you came in, and another on the floor by the couch opposite it; grabbing a single pair of cartridges (on alternating runs) will keep you topped up.
Order your squadmates to switch to their most effective long range weapons such as sniper and assault rifles, and also activate any ammo powers (if you picked up the Vindicator rifle they will have been deactivated for your party). Incendiary Ammo is good at slowing down unprotected organic targets as it can induce panic by igniting them.
If you happen to have Dominate as your bonus power, be advised that it can be downright counterproductive to use on enemies here, as they usually won't stop trying to cross the bridge to get to your position. This applies to both the Dominated target(s), or nearby enemies engaged by the Dominated target(s). Applying a strong barrier to enemies can make it impossible for you to take them down and basically gives them a free ride into the base.
An extremely confused YMIR once again on Jaroth's side if it stays alive long enough
Eventually, Jaroth will have had enough and sends in the YMIR mech. Any downed squadmates will automatically revive after the cutscene where the YMIR shows up. If it was sabotaged earlier, the mech will fight against its own side. On higher difficulties, the mercs will finish off the mech fairly quickly unless you and your team provide very effective supporting fire. While it's alive, enemies will focus all their attention on it, so you don't have to worry about taking damage yourself. Focus on Eclipse Heavies and Vanguards which can do the most damage to the rogue YMIR. If you're able to keep the YMIR alive, it can live long enough to face down Jaroth with a small amount of health left, though note that if the YMIR stays alive for too long, the hack will wear off and it starts attacking you. This usually isn't a problem on higher difficulties as it will die first. A useful tactic is to blow off the YMIR's head once the mercs wear it down; the resulting critical overload will likely be fatal to any enemies in the vicinity.
If the YMIR is hostile, it will advance into the building, and if you're upstairs this means there will be a period during which it is obstructed from view and you can safely deal with other enemies. However, the YMIR can and will come all the way upstairs to Garrus' room, so don't get taken unaware!
Combat Tips:
If you hacked the YMIR earlier, then its arrival creates a good opportunity to grab a complete refill of ammunition as there will be no pressure on Garrus' health bar for a while.
The YMIR's large size makes it a ""power magnet;"" it tends to be harder to target smaller enemies around it with powers until they get closer than the YMIR. A zoomed sniper rifle makes targeting powers easier.
If the YMIR was hacked, more enemies spawn than if it was not hacked, but the fight overall remains much easier, particularly as it is usually possible to contain enemies on the bridge.
Jaroth, having lost a large number of mercs, enters the battle himself. If the salarian is kept on the bridge, he will be no trouble at all. He is armed with an M-6 Carnifex and also has armor protection in addition to shields, but Stasis can still freeze and then ragdoll him regardless. After he and the rest of the Eclipse mercs have been taken care of, Garrus will tell you to come and find him. Before talking to him, grab some thermal clips and perhaps a med pack or two from around the base. You can loot a foot locker in the room where Garrus is for 2000 credits, and also check the upstairs bedroom opposite the atrium for a wall safe (4,000 credits). You should also save your game.
Tip: If you're relying on an ammo power from one of your squadmates be sure it's activated for all of your weapons before talking to Garrus, as you may not get another chance until after completing the next section of the mission. Incendiary Ammo is strongly recommended.
The Blood Pack Attack[]
While you are talking with Garrus, a distant explosion rocks the entire base. It appears that the bombs the merc leaders mentioned earlier (if you talked with them) went off and breached the tunnels in the lower levels that Garrus had closed off. Now you must make a decision: take the whole team down to the basement to deal with the breaches, or split up two and two.
An important thing to know about the upcoming fight in the basement is that while Garrus' life bar will take damage while you're down there, it will not fully deplete—Garrus can't die. His life will only be reduced down to a minimum level that is about 20-25% of maximum. So there is time pressure only in terms of how much of his life bar is remaining when you finish in the basement and return to the main hideout for the final showdown with the remaining Blood Pack forces, including their leader, Garm. If you are able to seal the tunnels in the basement quickly, Garrus will have more life when you return, which may make it easier to keep him alive in that final battle. Leaving a squadmate with Garrus will slow down the rate at which his life bar depletes, giving you about 30% more time before it bottoms out.
Squad Strategy: Consider how effective your squadmates are at helping you deal with armored foes with their active abilities. If you have a squadmate who is mainly benefiting you passively, e.g. with an ammo power or Miranda's Cerberus Officer bonus, have them stay with Garrus, as you'll continue to receive that benefit anyway. Squadmates with a heavy focus on anti-shield powers like Overload won't be that useful in the basement. Ultimately though, the decision on whether to leave someone with Garrus comes down to which fight you think is the hardest: the basement, or the fight with Garm when you return. If you've never played this mission before or you're unsure of your combat prowess, it is recommended that you take both squadmates with you to help you beat the basement, as it can be very challenging depending on how well-equipped and leveled up Shepard is.
The Blood Pack attackers consist primarily of vorcha with a few krogan and varren appearing as well. Neither krogan or vorcha have shields, but both can regenerate health; on higher difficulties, they both possess armor as well. Weapons and ammo powers should be chosen appropriately, with heavy pistols, sniper rifles, and powers such as Incinerate or Warp being effective.
Garrus giving you directions
Garrus tells you to go to the basement through the door under the stairs. On your way there, pick up the tech damage upgrade on the ground floor if you didn't previously.
Once in the basement, Garrus will tell you that three shutters need to be closed in order to secure the lower level. When you first enter the basement, straight ahead is a Weapons Locker as well as a Medical Station. If you left a squadmate with Garrus and you received an ammo power from that squadmate, you'll start this sequence with that power active (provided it was active before talking to Garrus); however, you'll no longer be able to have that squadmate reapply the power for the duration of the fight in the basement. Changing guns at the Weapons Locker will reset your party's active ammo powers and so will loading a save, so bear that in mind.
The three shutters you will have to seal in this section require you to get right up to them and hit a green button on the right side to close them. Each shutter will only close after ten seconds (a visible countdown will appear). If there are any enemies too close to the shutter or Shepard is past the shutter, the countdown is immediately interrupted and the shutter will not close until you clear any obstructions and hit the button again for a fresh ten second countdown. Once a shutter closes and all enemies in the immediate area are dead, any downed squadmates will automatically revive. The basement sequence ends immediately after closing the third shutter; after a brief cutscene you will be back on the ground floor of Garrus' hideout to face Garm and his remaining forces.
Garrus does not start losing health until you close the first shutter. As stated earlier, Garrus cannot die while you're in the basement, his life bar stops taking damage at about 20% remaining. If Garrus starts with max or near max health, with two squadmates, you will have about 5 minutes to close the remaining two shutters before Garrus' life bar is reduced to its minimum value; leaving one squadmate behind, you will have about 6 minutes and 40 seconds. It is entirely possible to successfully protect Garrus with only his minimum life remaining after you return from the basement, so if you are confident you can do so, feel free to take your time here and forget about Garrus' life bar entirely for now.
Turian batman's batcave
The first shutter is directly ahead of you down a short ramp after the Weapons Locker and can be closed without much effort if you run to it. Enemies consisting of a krogan and some vorcha will appear beyond the shutter as you get close to the shutter control; hit the button and take cover on either side of the door. Hitting the advancing enemies with a power or some weapon fire should slow them down enough to prevent them from interfering with the shutter and it closes. If for some reason you end up in a prolonged fight here, additional vorcha will continue to spawn and approach the shutter, but no additional krogan appear. However, Blood Pack Pyros will start to show up in subsequent waves.
There is a medkit in this area; either collect it now, or save it for right before you deal with the final shutter.
The final two shutters are located in areas beyond the doors to the left and right of the shutter you just closed. One is in the ""utility"" area and the other is in the garage; both areas are helpfully labeled with signs on the walls. Doing the garage first is recommended as it takes less time to get from there back to the utility area to close the final shutter, and there is a medi-gel pickup available in the garage that you may not be able to get if you close the garage shutter last.
Note: Opening the door to either the garage or the utility area causes the door leading to the other area to lock, meaning once you choose an area you must close the shutter in that area before you can proceed to the next.
If you thought blundering around a garage in the dark was dangerous, try doing it in one with varren and krogan
Garrus' garage contains a lot of crates, vehicles, and other cover as well as a lot of open space. It also contains several vorcha and also a varren slinking around that can be difficult to spot, but it usually tries to get to you as soon as you enter. There is also a krogan waiting for you near the shutter. The shutter controls are across the room from the entrance; use the cover in the room to advance carefully towards it. Be on the lookout for explosive crates and canisters you can detonate to help soften up enemies. Advance to the shutter and close it off while keeping the Blood Pack at bay. A steady stream of vorcha, varren, and krogan will pour through the shutter, so crowd control tactics are necessary to keep them from interfering with the shutter closing. Once this one is closed, pick up any ammo and the med-kit from the corner (to the right of the shutter when you are facing the shutter closing button) and head back towards the ""utility area"" where the third and final shutter is located.
Combat Strategy: The garage is arguably the hardest fight in an already difficult mission because of the unending stream of enemies combined with the time pressure created by Garrus' steadily depleting health bar (if you're concerned about that). An effective and time-saving technique is to equip the M-622 Avalanche beforehand and freeze all of the enemies waiting for you in the garage while you get to the door and close it (do not kill them). The reason the Avalanche is the best choice here is because it can disable enemies for a very long time (about 30 seconds) without killing them; killing enemies causes them to be ""replaced"" by new enemies spawning from beyond the shutter where they can advance and interfere with closing it. Freezing all the enemies with the Avalanche makes it much easier to close the shutter without being interrupted by additional enemies.
Note that your squadmate(s) will continue to attack frozen enemies; to prevent this, you can manually order them to attack something else, or keep them in cover to deny them line of sight. The frozen enemies will eventually thaw, but by that time you should have closed the shutter and you can turn around and deal with them any way you like. Even if one or two die and get replaced by new enemies approaching from ahead, just freeze them as well, or disable or kill them some other way. If enemies behind you thaw before you're ready to deal with them, there is a piece of cover on the right side of the shutter you can use to shelter from them.
Combat Tips:
Grunt is a powerful squadmate here for his sheer durability alone; he can take point for you admirably, and he's capable of dealing with varren at close quarters.
Stasis is very handy to have for the garage as it can be used to instantly disable any enemy you meet even if it's protected by armor; this is especially useful against krogan.
If you're hurt don't hesitate to use Unity to heal yourself up to full health (and shields if you've researched the necessary upgrades). It's faster and safer to use medi-gel than waiting to recharge health and shields normally (especially if you are not playing Legendary Edition), and it's very easy to take damage from unexpected quarters in the garage.
Dominate can be a much more effective power here than it is on the bridge, especially to use on enemies on the other side of the shutter you are trying to close, as it will stall them from trying to cross past the shutter as well as distract other nearby enemies from doing the same.
Even if you are trying to finish this fight quickly to preserve as much of Garrus' life bar as possible, don't rush to your death. You have several minutes to work with.
As you exit the garage, straight ahead of you will be the door leading to the ""utility"" area and the final shutter. Pick up the med-kit to the left of the door before you proceed inside.
Warning:  Kasumi's Shadow Strike power is extremely unreliable in the ""utility"" area likely due to the numerous obstacles impeding movement and its cramped nature. She will often report being unable to use the power if ordered to. Also note that Kasumi cannot Shadow Strike an enemy past an open shutter.
Quite a few vermin on the way, fortunately there's a lot of waist-high barriers to take refuge on during the shutter close countdown
The way to the final shutter requires Shepard's group to climb over a series of obstacles with enemy vorcha using many of these obstacles as cover. Take them out as they pop up and advance. Around a corner when you reach a right turn in the passage there is a Blood Pack Pyro; don't turn the corner or you may be instantly fried. You'll need to use some clever tactics to get past. Teammates can be sent around the corner as decoys (Grunt is likely the only squadmate who might survive this), and Adrenaline Rush, Combat Drone, or Tactical Cloak can be useful if Shepard has them.
The M-622 Avalanche makes this corner a breeze as its shots have a large enough area of effect that simply firing a few at the walls will take out the Pyro and any other vorcha around the corner without exposing yourself. Once you turn the corner take out any remaining vorcha and move over more obstacles to reach the final shutter straight ahead. As before, enemies will start appearing beyond the shutter and start moving towards you but it shouldn't be too hard to stall them before it closes.
Garm always beelines for Garrus so dispose of his minions quickly
Garrus will contact you immediately after the third shutter is closed and tell you that Garm and his Blood Pack have breached the base on the main floor. A cutscene will play after which you find yourself back on the ground floor of the hideout engaging the final Blood Pack assault. In addition to vorcha, there will be varren as well, which you should prioritize or they can flush you out of cover. You should then get upstairs as fast as possible to defeat Garm, who rushes straight for Garrus at the start of the fight, largely ignoring your party with the possible exception of hurling taunts at certain squad members.
Speaking of your squad, you will again have full access to both of your teammates again if you had left one behind with Garrus; however, any squadmate you left with Garrus will still be on the second floor area with him (usually taking cover behind one of the couches up there), so be careful about using any squad movement commands that could send them running to their doom. The squadmate with Garrus will be able to soften Garm up a bit, but Garm often ignores them and remains single-mindedly focused on blasting Garrus with his shotgun until you get up to the second floor to deal with him yourself, at which point he and any other surviving enemy krogan will turn to face you, taking the heat off the turian.
Tip: Right at the start of this fight after the cutscene, Garm and most of the Blood Pack are in a group straight ahead near the base of the stairs. A volley of heavy weapon fire while they are still tightly clustered can devastate the entire group. Having your heavy weapon out after you hit the final basement shutter before the cutscene can save some time switching weapons.
Once Garm and the rest of the Blood Pack are dead, refill on ammo and medi-gel as needed, and make a final save before talking to Garrus if you want. This is the last opportunity to pick up the M-15 Vindicator from the couch, or any of the medkits or other items on the ground floor.
Only the Blue Suns remain.
The Blue Suns Attack[]
Jentha-of-the-nice-hairdo laying down suppressive fire while reinforcements drop from the window
Talking to Garrus this time fills Shepard in on his history with Garm and both agree to fight past the Blue Suns to make it out. However, before they can make a break for it, they get ambushed by Tarak and his gunship. The gunship isn't yet a valid target and will fly around occasionally firing rockets at you all while dropping waves of Blue Suns infantry into the compound. The gunship will first drop Jentha, who has both shields and armor and is armed with a deadly M-76 Revenant; a Blue Suns Legionnaire; and several Troopers on the second floor through the far window. Tarak's gunship doesn't participate in the initial assault other than to drop troops in, EXCEPT it always fires a volley of two rockets in through the far window at you. Be sure to duck.
Combat Strategy: The best way to prevent Garrus from taking damage is to position yourself or a squadmate closer to the attackers than Garrus is, as this will usually cause them to shift their attention away from Garrus. If Garrus is their closest target, he'll get mauled, particularly by Jentha. If you notice she is focusing all her fire on him, you'll need to do something about that, whether it's to stun her, overheat her weapon (Flashbang Grenade works well), or simply take her out ASAP. Once again, Grunt is an excellent squadmate here as his ability to absorb damage makes him ideal for drawing fire away from Garrus; position him behind one of the white planters connected to the couches close to the far window where the first wave of Blue Suns will enter. If enemies decide to ignore the krogan, you can order him to charge their positions and teach them why that's a bad idea.
Even if Grunt is not with you, you yourself can take a forward position to be the bullet magnet, but this is risky for obvious reasons. Note that the white planters are better cover than the couches, which you should avoid. Any fragile squadmates should be put in cover as far back out of the way as possible.
Once the first wave of Blue Suns are all down, a second wave enters on the main level that must also be dealt with. Garrus repositions to the inner balcony to fire down on them; the best way to draw fire away from him is to move one squadmate next to him there, then take the second squadmate with you to a position at the top of the stairs to hold it against all comers. This can be dangerous, but use the corner and the high ground to your advantage and it's doable even on higher difficulties. The main danger to you will be the shotgun-wielding turians coming up the stairs at you, but if you can remove their shields, force abilities such as Concussive Shot can knock them back down the stairs.
Tip: Sometimes no matter what you do to try and distract them, enemies remain focused on Garrus. If you're ever in danger of losing him, don't hesitate to take out a heavy weapon and blast away. A few shots from the M-622 Avalanche will stun and eventually freeze an entire attack group.
Heads up... or better yet, heads down
After clearing out the main floor, a cutscene shows Tarak's gunship getting the drop on Garrus, wounding him. Garrus tries to fight back but gets hit with a blast from a rocket that leaves him unconscious. Now your objective is to take out the gunship while also fighting some additional waves of Blue Suns dropping into the second floor from the far window. Note: you will be locked into the balcony area for the remainder of the mission as the door leading out of the room closes and can't be opened.
The ideal cover position for Shepard during this fight is back behind a white crate connected to a planter closest to the near wall by the (now closed) door. Like many of the ideal cover spots in Mass Effect 2, this position is helpfully marked by respawning thermal clips, two in this case. This position is completely safe from the gunship as long as you're behind the crate or the planter though of course you still need to be careful when you pop out to shoot. It's still possible to shoot the gunship from this position even when it approaches the near window as the very tip of its left ""wing"" will still be visible. There is enough space behind this cover position to fit both squadmates, but to avoid crowding one should be kept in cover inside the balconette of the rearmost window to your left. Since you're on top of two respawning thermal clips there's no need to conserve ammo. Lay into the gunship whenever you can (i.e. between merc waves and rocket volleys) and eventually it will go down.
Combat Tips:
Despite the tenseness of the situation, the major pressure of having to keep Garrus' health bar from dropping is now gone so there is no rush. As long as you take the right cover positions and don't get nailed by the gunship this fight is actually fairly easy compared to the rest of the mission.
You start this fight with you and your squadmates out of cover, which—annoyingly—often results in one of your squadmates getting drilled to death by the gunship immediately. If this happens use a medi-gel and order them to safety as soon as they revive.
If you took the time to zap Cathka earlier, the gunship will be at half its normal hitpoints. The gunship only has an armor bar so anti-armor weapons and powers are most effective against it.
The gunship has two main weapons, a rapid fire mass accelerator cannon and rockets, both of which deal extreme damage if they catch you or your squadmates exposed. The rockets also have a fairly large area of effect so if the gunship starts spraying rockets all over the room it's best to hunker down until it's over.
Once the gunship and all other remaining hostiles are down a cutscene plays. It shows Shepard rushing over and kneeling beside Garrus, who is laying in a pool of his own blood. After a moment of silence his eyes open, he gasps for air, and he tightens his grip on his sniper rifle pulling it closer to him. A distraught Shepard orders a squadmate to radio Joker and tell him to be ready for them."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Reaper_IFF,"Prerequisite: Collector Ship (mission)
Upon completion of the Collector Ship mission, the Illusive Man will give Shepard the location of a derelict Reaper in order to acquire its IFF. A Cerberus science team had been tasked with investigating it but the team has since stopped reporting in. The Reaper is orbiting the brown dwarf Mnemosyne in the Thorne system in the Hawking Eta cluster.","Cerberus Ship[]
Go through the door. On the left, there is a small laboratory with a Wall Safe (+2000 credits) that can be bypassed, an accessible Terminal (+2000 credits), another Wall Safe (+4000 credits) that can be bypassed, and a Work Log. Dr. Chandana is the leader of the Cerberus research team. His log indicates the beginning of Reaper indoctrination of his team. At the end of the hallway are two medical stations with two medi-gels, and another Work Log by a Cerberus scientist, reporting on the examination of specimens inside the Reaper. Dr. Chandana was apparently ""listening"" to the specimens.
Go through the airlock into the Reaper itself. The Reaper activates its kinetic barriers. Joker radios that the Normandy cannot retrieve them until the barriers come down. EDI advises destroying the mass effect core to remove the barriers. However, the mass effect core also powers the mass effect fields that prevent the Reaper from falling into the brown dwarf.
Reaper Interior[]
Across the catwalk the next work log plays the message:
""What the hell is this? How can we remember the same thing?""
Cerberus Scientist: You're married?  You never mentioned that.
Cerberus Researcher: Katy had anger management issues.  When my brother got married, the best man tried to hit on her.  She kicked him down the church steps.
Cerberus Scientist: Wh—?  Katy's my wife!  I must have told you the story.
Cerberus Researcher: No.  I know my wife.  I remember — that day was the only time I saw her wear stockings.
Cerberus Scientist: Yeah.  The kind with seams up the back.  That's what I remember, too.
Cerberus Researcher: What the hell is this?  How can we remember the same thing?
As soon as you pass by an explosive crate, Husks and an Abomination appear. It is best to backpedal and to blow up the crates when Husks are nearby. Husks only have melee attacks, so it is wise to keep your distance. Also, Abominations do suicide charges and will explode upon death, no matter how they died. Throughout this level in certain areas, Husks spawn by climbing up over the sides of the walkways. There will also be numerous explosive items mainly explosive crates and containers. Use them wisely, because the husks can quickly overwhelm you and your squad. Using Overload on an explosive item produces a larger blast than just shooting it. Try to use Overload on an explosive item only when there is a mass of enemies nearby to maximize the effect.
Once the Husks are down, move up to the next set of crates and be prepared for another fight. There will be more here so the nearby explosive crate is useful. Just make sure that your squadmates are not using the crates for cover. After that group is sent to oblivion, your party comments that this proves that husks must be made from Reaper technology, not geth. There's another work log in this area that plays the message:
""I'm telling you, this ship isn't dead. It knows we're inside it.""
Cerberus Scientist: Third day with this headache.  You'd think Chandana would have let me take a few hours off.
Goddamn!
Cerberus Researcher: What?
Cerberus Scientist: That thing that just… gray thing! It disappeared when I looked straight at it.  Came out of the damn wall!  Where we took off that panel.
Cerberus Researcher: I didn't see anything.  You should lie down.
Cerberus Scientist: I'm telling you, this ship isn't dead.  It knows we're inside it.
Cerberus Researcher: Calm down.  Now I'm getting a headache.
Be mindful of huge explosion opportunities
Head down the walkway to see and hear gunfire from an unknown party shooting Husks. Your party makes the comments about another person being on the ship. At the end of the walkway to the right are some power cells, a crate of Refined Platinum (+2000 platinum), a Cerberus Rifle that awards a Sniper Rifle Damage upgrade, and a Terminal (+3500 credits).
Turn left into an open area. Take note of the cover, explosive items, and locations of thermal clips before moving too far in. Once you move in waves of Husks and Abominations attack. A Scion is in the final wave. You can retreat back to the walkway if you need a breather or more thermal clips.
Tip: If you are very fast in bypassing and willing to forego the Heavy Skin Weave upgrade, you can go to the right after the first wave, bypass the door, leave the area, and skip the fight. However, any attack on Shepard will interrupt the bypass and you have to start the bypass over. Note that following the bypass there is a brief (several seconds) ""airlock procedure"" during which you will need to stay alive. Fortunately as long as you take down the first wave of husks before attempting this, the huge hordes that spawn for the last wave won't make it into this passage in time to stop you.
Once you defeat all the enemies, walk to the other end of the room. At the end of the area are a med-kit with medi-gel, and a hackable Research Terminal which awards a Heavy Skin Weave upgrade. Some Dragon's teeth are visible, and if certain squadmates are present, the person will comment upon them. You can earn some morality points based on your dialogue choice. A Work Log in the area will play the message:
“Chandana said the ship was dead. We trusted him. He was right. But even a dead god can dream. A god — a real god — is a verb. Not some old man with magic powers. It's a force. It warps reality just by being there. It doesn't have to want to. It doesn't have to think about it. It just does. That's what Chandana didn't get. Not until it was too late. The god's mind is gone but it still dreams. He knows now. He's tuned in on our dreams.  If I close my eyes I can feel him. I can feel every one of us.”
Once done here, head to the airlock and on to the next area.
Reaper Exterior[]
Cerberus structures form a straightforward path to the Reaper's core
Bypass the door and go through the airlock. A cutscene starts. A geth sniper with bits of N7 armor attached to it snipes several Husks by Shepard's party. The geth recognizes you as ""Shepard-Commander"", then leaves.
More Husks and an Abomination soon appear; deal with them and then put your squad into cover and walk down the stairs. Once you go past the crate in the center, there will be Husks, an Abomination, and a Scion. You can retreat back upwards to make the stairs as a chokepoint.
Since Husks are melee enemies, it is generally best to stay ""on the move"" rather than getting in cover—this makes it much less likely you will be trapped by husks, and by moving around you will often confuse them. Obviously as the Scion approaches you will need to either interpose objects between you and it, or move perpendicular to the line of its shockwave. The site of the first battle after you leave the airlock makes a good battlefield-of-last-resort to pull back to—you have room to run around to dodge husks but also the giant tank on the right side to interpose between you and the Scion.
Once the enemies are dealt with, go up the stairs at the other end. To the left will be med-kit with medi-gel and a Terminal (+3000 credits). Advance carefully because moving too far will result in attacks by more Husks and one Abomination. Once they are down, nearby there is another Terminal (+3500 credits). Down the stairs are more Husks, Abominations, and a Scion. Use the stairs as a choke point again and then take them out. Once done, a med-kit with medi-gel is on the staircase. A Cerberus Shotgun with a Shotgun Damage upgrade and some power cells await you at the bottom of the stairs around the corner. Further on, up the ramp, are a bunch of thermal clips and another Terminal (+3500 credits). This area will be crucial in the next fight.
The next battle will be Husks, Abominations, and two Scions. This battle will be tough no matter the difficulty because of the amount of enemies that come at you. The Husks will charge at you. Keep your squadmates, and yourself for that matter, back or you will regret it. Use powers, specialized ammunition, and shotguns for close up damage when you need to.
The Reaper IFF
One way to finish this area easily is to retreat back to the room you just came from, where only three or so husks and the two Scions will approach, since the additional husks only spawn when you get close again. Once the Husks are down, focus on the Scions. The Scions will approach last and are easier to deal with than the Husks; the best thing is to take one yourself and use your squadmates against the other. Once they are down, move on but be careful.
When you reach a left turn, get ready because Husks, Abominations, and two more Scions will come crawling over the railings and from the core. Take them out and do not be afraid to backpedal if necessary.
After they all have fallen, pick up the power cells and a little further down near the doorway is a med-kit with medi-gel. Bypass the door and enter yet another airlock. Inside is the Reaper IFF and a Wall Safe (+2500 credits) that can be bypassed.
Tip: Save your game at this point before the final battle. If you are going to use the M-920 Cain to one-shot the Core, you may want to pull it out before you go into the room.
Mass Effect Core[]
The geth in mass effect core area.
Once you enter, the game auto-saves and a cutscene plays. The geth sniper from before is manipulating some controls. It drops a barrier allowing Shepard and the team inside. However, Husks overcome the geth and knock it out.
The objective of the battle is to destroy the Reaper Core, but an iris often closes to cover it, preventing any damage. The iris is open at the beginning, but closes when attacked or when the initial Husks are dead. It will stay closed for between 45 seconds and a minute. Subsequent closures are between 30 and 45 seconds in length. Meanwhile, waves of Husks and Abominations attack you. They respawn as long as the Core is closed, but they always come from the same areas every time. Use that to your advantage if you start to get overwhelmed.
Cain the Core: As mentioned above, the M-920 Cain can destroy the Core in one direct hit on any difficulty, but be careful as a Cain projectile's trajectory can be affected by Mass Effect 2's aim assist, so any enemies highlighted in the HUD when you fire it can cause the shot to fire off target. The Cain ignores cover and is capable of destroying the Core even if its shutters are closed, so there's no rush—take the time to eliminate the first couple of husks between you and the Core before lining up your shot.
If you choose to destroy the Core without using the Cain, you can only damage it when the iris is open. It will stay open until you have taken its health down by a third, so do not feel pressured into immediately firing into it when it opens up—just take pot shots whenever you're presently safe from husks.
They'll swarm at you from both sides of the raised platform
When the Core is open, enemies do not spawn, so it is possible to eliminate them all, then sweep up thermal clips and let powers recharge before shooting up the Core, though this may of course result in the spawning of more total enemies. Squadmates will also revive when the Core is open and all enemies are dead, so it may be best to put off using medi-gel if the Core is going to open soon. The thermal clips around the room will regenerate so there is no lack of ammunition as long as you can get to them.
Tip: It is a good idea to fight this battle while facing away from the Core as much as possible, as having the Core in view will often result in your powers and your squadmates' powers (if you have them on manual cast) hitting the Core instead of what you were trying to target. Likewise, if you're trying to hit the Core with powers, try to avoid having other enemy targets in view that can interfere.
Unlike the rest of the level, there are no handy explosive items. On the lefthand side on a table, there's a Laptop (+1000 credits). It must be taken during battle since there will be no opportunity to walk around the area afterwards.
Every enemy here is effectively a melee opponent, so mobility is key. If you can just avoid being trapped/surrounded by husks you can keep on the move and be fine. Your best position, when possible, is the top of the central bridge from which you have a commanding view of both sides of the room and can throw area effect powers at the masses of husks. Since most enemies will attempt to climb the stairs at the end away from the Reaper Core, standing on the bridge directly beneath the Reaper Core makes a very defensible position with easy escape routes on both sides. If things get too hot on the bridge then flee down to one side or the other where there is more space to dodge around—remember the husks aren't very good at stopping and turning around, and use their lack of maneuverability against them. Prioritize taking out any Abominations to prevent them from detonating on you or your team."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_Captain_Bailey,Go to the Citadel and go through the only door leading to the main area.,"Upon attempting to exit the docking area, Shepard is stopped as an alarm begins to sound—security has tightened since Shepard's last visit to the Citadel. Sergeant Haron orders the scanner to be shut down and apologizes for the inconvenience—the scanners seem to think Shepard is dead. He will then direct the Commander to his captain at the nearby C-Sec Office for help to clear it up.
Shepard's disturbing Bailey's nap - no wonder he's got that face
Captain Bailey sees the problem immediately, as his console says Shepard is dead. Shepard can ask how he knows the Commander isn't just an impostor, to which Bailey will reply that the scanners are accurate and the best in the galaxy. Shepard then has the option to either have Bailey fix the problem or keep it that way. Should Shepard choose to have him fix it, he will reinstate Shepard's IDs and note that he just saved Shepard about nine days of running around.
No matter what choice is made, afterward Bailey will suggest that Shepard head up to the Presidium to speak with the Council (the dialogue will differ depending on whether the character was imported from Mass Effect or not, and, if it was imported, whether or not the Council was saved). After that Shepard can either ask Bailey more questions or leave.
Note: This is an optional mission because you don't have to talk to Bailey at first. You get full access to the Citadel and are able to talk to the Council even if you don't talk to him.
Note: If the character was imported from Mass Effect and the Council was saved with Anderson or Udina as Councilor, you can go directly to the Council first and have Shepard's Spectre status reinstated. If the Council was killed, then the only way Shepard's status is reinstated is if Anderson is on the Council. When Shepard speaks with Bailey post-reinstatement, there will be a different set of initial dialog between Shepard and Bailey."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Collector_Base:_The_Long_Walk,This mission is triggered as part of Stop the Collectors: Defeat the Collectors once you have completed Collector Base: Infiltration.,"Your specialist's biotic field is big enough for some movement leeway
Note: At the start of all three major segments of the Collector Base mission including this one, your medi-gel and heavy weapon ammo are given a complete refill to 100% capacity.
Tip: Save often in this mission because of its difficulty.
The mission begins with your biotic specialist urging you to move while proceeding until reaching a corner. SAVE here, make any final preparations, and then select the specialist to move on. As you move into the room you see (and hear) the Seeker Swarms in all directions, occasionally impacting the biotic bubble. Leaving the bubble will cause you to take damage until you die. The same goes for your squadmates; however, they will not leave the bubble of their own accord.
Be careful, as the bubble can obscure visibility, and the seekers beating against it doesn't help at all. Use your crosshairs and bring up the Power Wheel to ""freeze"" time and locate enemies if you are having trouble seeing.
Stop 1[]
Eventually you reach a point where you come under fire and the specialist takes cover because they cannot fight. You should also take cover and defend against the attacking Collectors. Harbinger makes an appearance and will be the only one to try to run up the ramp to flank you. Make sure he doesn’t because he can take out you and your squad very quickly. The Collectors will not keep coming, so when you take them out you're done. Save the game and select your specialist to move on.
Stop 2[]
Harbinger possession isn't the biggest threat in this mission...
This walk is a short one because you will come under attack again. As the specialist moves toward the next stop, a few Husks and Abominations crawl up to charge the team. However, they appear at some distance, so it is possible to take them out at range. Several Collectors then fly overhead, with one being possessed by Harbinger mid-flight - this is a good opportunity to weaken and possibly take out a couple of the Collectors before they land. Abilities that send things flying around will cause opponents to crash land damaged, where they'll take some time to recover, giving Shepard and company time to either get into cover or fire on the disabled attackers.
The specialist takes cover on a docked platform behind a pillar while the Collectors land in preparation for their attack. As the platform occupies low ground and is protected by the biotic field, it can be used for cover.
Visibility can be particularly bad at this point, but an alternative is to simply eliminate Harbinger as he systematically possesses each Collector; his flaming body makes him easy to spot, and the fact that he doesn't take cover or chase you past the pillar where the specialist is hiding makes this fairly straightforward. Unfortunately, your squadmates do not take cover effectively and on higher difficulties they can quickly get gunned down if not by Harbinger then by the other Collector troops which include the elite Collector Guardians and Assassins. This often leaves Shepard alone to do the heavy lifting here, which can certainly work as long as you are careful and whittle down each enemy without exposing yourself to too much fire, but if you want your squad to survive consider bringing Kasumi to disable Harbinger with her Flashbang Grenade continuously while you focus on killing the other Collector troops, then kill Harbinger last. This has the added advantage of minimizing the amount of times you need to plow through Harbinger. Alternatively, bring very durable squadmates such as Grunt and Legion and just power through with brute force.
However you choose to deal with the attackers, save afterwards because the next stop is the hardest. Note:  If you're low on ammo search the area for thermal clips; at least one can usually be found a short distance outside the biotic bubble back the way you came, and it's possible to get it without taking too much damage from the swarms. When you're ready, prompt the specialist and move on.
Stop 3[]
...It's the potentially confining battleground care of charging husks
As you start to move out the specialist starts to struggle to maintain the field, but they are still capable of moving. Eventually you come under attack again so take cover and watch out from the flanks and from the front. This time you are only attacked by Husks, a Scion and Abominations. The husks and Abominations swarm you and your squad, so focus on them first because of the danger they pose. Once the husks stop coming focus on the approaching Scion and take it out before it reaches you.
There is a short wall just opposite where your specialist takes cover that provides adequate cover to protect you from the Scion even if you lean out of cover. From this position, deal with the husks in the most time efficient way possible. Your heavy weapon ammo is restored when you begin the next part of the Suicide Mission, so feel free to pull out your chosen heavy weapon and go to town on the husks with it, and once they stop coming, take out the Scion before it gets too close. During this encounter you should not hesitate to use medi-gel to restore you or your squad to full health and shields, especially since direct hits from the Scion delay normal shield recharging.
A Combat Drone, if available, will keep the Scion distracted for a long time, preventing it from launching dangerous shockwaves at you while you take out the other enemies, so if you're an Engineer or brought an appropriately equipped squadmate, be sure to keep it active.
Nuke 'Em: The M-920 Cain can make this section much easier by nuking the Scion immediately. Simply wait until the Scion is about to appear (about 5-10 seconds after you hear your second fire team leader down an enemy over the radio, or shortly before your biotic specialist comes to a stop) and begin charging a shot aimed at the ground near where the Scion will emerge. You shouldn't get interrupted as long as you time the shot in this way, and it should kill or all but kill the Scion even on Insanity. Focusing the Scion first is better than leaving it alive while focusing the husks as it keeps your squad from being leveled by its attacks. Even better, it's basically a ""free"" shot because your heavy weapon ammo will be totally refilled at the end of the level.
The Vacuum Cleaner: The M-490 Blackstorm can shine during the ""husk rush"" as well. The Singularity-like projectiles fired by the weapon create a vortex that will stop, damage, and eventually suck in both Husks and Abominations, killing them instantly. The singularities created have a large radius and long duration that will not only keep any husks from getting to you, but as long as the Scion is within range of one of the vortices, it will be continuously staggered, preventing it from attacking you, and the detonations deal heavy damage to it as well. Spamming 3-4 shots (or just emptying your entire weapon if you feel so inclined) can end this fight without you taking so much as a scratch. This tactic can be superior to using the Cain, as you can use the Blackstorm in some of the earlier fights with the Collectors too, and it's fairly effective against Harbinger.
However you decide to handle this encounter, once all the husks are put down, save, select your specialist and move on.
Warning: The pause before talking to the specialist is the last opportunity to make a manual save for the rest of the Collector Base mission.
Long Walk[]
If your biotic specialist isn't strong enough, one of your team will see their own light at the end of their own tunnel
The specialist is now almost entirely exhausted, strained to their limits by maintaining the field. The specialist remarks that the squad needs to reach the end soon.
This next area offers little cover, and like the mission name suggests is nothing but a long walk. Be careful in this area: there are no Collectors, but you will have to face a few Husks and Abominations. They come up from the sides, so whip out the shotguns, if you can, and take them out before they can kill you.
Once the door is in sight, the specialist comments again that they need to reach it fast. Now it is a race, as the specialist is limp-running to the end. Once you leap over barriers in the middle of the ramp, a cutscene plays.
The squad races down the ramp and the door is opened by a squadmate who runs ahead:
If you have a non-loyal or non-ideal squadmate projecting the barrier, the biotic falls from exhaustion and whichever squadmate is providing a rearguard is carried away by the swarm.
If the chosen biotic specialist is loyal and ideal, they push the barrier back, sending the swarms and Collectors flying, and everyone makes it in safely.
Note: The order in which squadmates die is: Thane, Jack, Garrus, Legion, Grunt, Samara, Jacob, Mordin, Tali, Kasumi, Zaeed, Morinth. Miranda is unable to die in this section, so if she is put on your squad with a non-loyal or non-ideal specialist, the second squadmate is always the one to die.
The second squad radios that they are under heavy attack, then someone hacks the door to allow them in. Shepard covers them and as the leader enters they are shot, Shepard rushes to their side:
If ideal: The leader shakes it off and survives.
If non-ideal: The leader grabs their stomach and collapses to the ground. The shot is fatal and the leader dies in Shepard's arms.
If you have only three members left in your party, any fireteam leader will survive - this is because you have to leave at least one to cover Shepard's squad.
Once the two teams regroup Joker reports on the status of whoever is escorting the crew back, then informs Shepard that the Collectors are massing outside the doors. Regardless of which option is chosen, Miranda says that the rest of the team will stay back to cover Shepard and a small squad."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Omega:_Aria_T%27Loak,"Prerequisite: Freedom's Progress (mission)
This mission is acquired automatically the first time Commander Shepard arrives at Omega. A batarian mercenary who works for Aria, named Moklan, will instruct you to meet with Aria as soon as possible.","Thrones and courtiers look the same no matter the century
This is one of the first missions Commander Shepard can receive should you decide to first go to the Omega station. Upon docking, a salarian named Fargut initially tries greeting Shepard and attempts to ingratiate himself with your company. He's interrupted in the process by Moklan, who muscles him out of the way, and instructs you to pay a visit to the asari Aria T'Loak. Both Fargut and Moklan have no further interactions with Shepard afterwards.
As you enter the front door of the Afterlife club, past an elcor bouncer, you may be accosted by a batarian named Kylan and his cohorts, who seem to be looking for trouble; dealing with them can earn you some morality points.
Aria resides at the top of the platform on the far side of the main area of Afterlife, accessible from stairs on both sides. Simply approach her to trigger a conversation.
Her guards will try to scan you, because Aria needs to verify if you're really Shepard and not some impostor with the Commander's face. Morality points are available if you resist the scans and after she tells you about Omega's one rule. After that, she sits down, and she beckons you to do the same. You may ask questions about Omega and the dossiers, or end the meeting. Don't worry, she isn't going anywhere, you can still ask your questions by talking to her again.
After the initial meet and greet, the mission will be completed.
Note:  While technically not part of this mission, you need to speak with Aria in order to advance Dossier: Archangel, the recruitment mission for Archangel. This mission ensures you do, because Aria points you to the relevant people to speak further with regarding that mission. It is not required to talk with Aria to advance Dossier: The Professor."

This mission is acquired upon first landing on Illium. After conversation with Careena, you will receive a journal entry named Illium: Liara T'Soni. Visit Liara in her office, on the administration level directly above the trading floor, and talk to her. Ask her to come with you whether here or by speaking to her again after concluding the conversation, though she will decline because she has other things to do first. Find out about these prior commitments and offer to help. This changes the mission's name to Illium: Liara: System Hacking.
Asking about her problem then declining to help will make Liara briefly strike her table in anger, but nevertheless she apologizes for the outburst and you get the System Hacking mission all the same.","Your bookish former squadmate has done well in your absence
Note:  Similar to Omega: Aria T'Loak, you need to speak with Liara to advance both Dossier: The Assassin and Dossier: The Justicar, the recruitment missions for both Thane and Samara. Liara points you to the relevant people to talk to in those missions, and Illium: Liara T'Soni provides an avenue for it.
Note: If the Lair of the Shadow Broker conversation option is selected after starting this mission, the hacking mission instantly completes without awarding credits or experience. Therefore, complete this mission before beginning the Shadow Broker DLC.
Liara needs you to disable security at key points around Nos Astra. It has to be you, because she needs someone she can trust (apparently her assistant Nyxeris doesn't count). She's unwilling to divulge more, because she knows everything she says is probably being recorded.
Matching terminal locations color-coded for convenience (best viewed in full)
Three terminals need to be hacked. They are all located on the southern portion of the map, where the Taxi Stand, Memories of Illium, Gateway Personal Defense, Tracking Office, and Baria Frontiers are located. After a terminal is hacked, Shepard has 60 seconds to find the corresponding vulnerable system to upload the data to Liara.
Once a terminal is hacked, a number in the lower-right corner will indicate the distance from the vulnerable system. Once all three terminals are hacked, you will receive an experience reward plus 5 Renegade points, and Liara calls to tell Shepard to return to her office. Talking to Liara again completes the mission, awards 2000 credits, and unlocks the follow-up mission: Illium: Liara: The Observer.
The first terminal can be found near the Tracking Office, its corresponding system is located on the left of Baria Frontiers.
The second terminal is located near Gateway Personal Defense (close to Charr) and its corresponding system  is just on the right of the Tracking Office.

Dr. Okeer

- Millennia of combat and strategic experience
- Rumored familiarity with Collector technology

A brilliant and brutal krogan warlord who fought in the Krogan Rebellions, Dr. Okeer has become obsessed with saving the krogan people from the genophage and is believed to have contacted the Collectors in an attempt to gain technology to that end. He is currently in a Blue Suns camp on Korlus, though the nature of his relationship with the mercenary group is unknown.","Arrival[]
When you land on Korlus, you will hear Jedore, the Commander of the local Blue Suns garrison, talking over a loudspeaker. Your squadmates provide various interesting comments on that. Continue on, you don't need to worry about cover until you make a right turn at the end.
When you make the turn and go down the stairs you'll arrive at an observation post, as one of your squadmates will attest. Immediately move your squad into cover as you will come under fire from three Blue Suns Troopers on top of the stairs. Stay in cover and keep putting down fire until the enemies are dead. Run up then down the stairs and you'll see a wounded merc on the ground. He's a compulsory encounter and you will stop to talk to him even if you intended to run past him.
He doesn't get paid enough to goddamn bleed out.
The conversation with the merc will lend some morality points as long as your Paragon or Renegade scores are high enough. They each can lead to enemies standing down or being misled. You also have the option of telling the merc not to blow the whistle on you when his allies radio in, without using Charm or Intimidate. He will initially seem to comply, but then starts warning his cohorts about you, which triggers a Renegade interrupt you can use to make that decision his last. Not taking this interrupt results in you facing additional enemies later.
You can get some answers about what is going on at the planet and the krogan wandering around. The options can provide some good info for later. The merc eventually wanders off at the end of the conversation, provided you didn't kill him after not using Charm/Intimidate. An autosave is generated as well. Continue on and be prepared for more enemy contact, and more annoying speeches from the loudspeakers. If you let the merc go without resorting to Charm/Intimidate dialogue, Jedore will be alerted to your presence and will send more hostiles your way. Otherwise, the loudspeaker comments are none the wiser, for now.
Jedore threatening to withhold pay bonuses is enough bring out the dog mechs
Combat Tip: The next series of fights will be with enemies in inaccessible locations and almost always on high ground, so you will receive relatively little ammo resupply for now. So you may want to consider conserving your best ammo (e.g. sniper or assault rifle) for key targets, reverting to pistols and powers when there are only one or two enemies. Since there is no time pressure and since they cannot advance on your position, you can exclusively use powers to patiently kill them. Also, knocking enemies off of their platforms with powers like Concussive Shot or biotics will often knock them out of play, killing them instantly.
The first skirmish is on a trench with two Blue Suns Troopers on an inaccessible rampart on the far side. Once you descend into the trench another two Troopers appear on an inaccessible bridge above, plus two FENRIS Mechs if the wounded merc blabbed on your presence. There's a med-kit near a pile of crates on the trench, but beyond it another pair of Troopers emerge from the inaccessible catwalk a few dozen meters away (plus again, two FENRIS mechs if increased hostiles are at play).
It's a power sniper's playground
When you go up the ramp exiting the trench and on to the next area, radio chatter indicates they're beginning to suspect outsider interference if they weren't aware of your team yet, or they're beginning to realize you have a highly trained team and not just a bunch of rival mercs. The next fight is on an open area studded with cover, but your enemies are all on high ground and still inaccessible: two Blue Suns Heavies (three if increased hostiles) and about four Troopers. This is decisively a long-range fight and accuracy dropoff from short-range weapons will be a concern. There is a modest amount of thermal clips scattered about, so even if you can't reach the clips dropped by hostiles you can still replenish your ammo up to a point.
The next area has a single krogan on the ground fighting against Blue Suns soldiers atop a wall. At this point radio chatter has finally confirmed your intrusion regardless of whether you let the wounded merc earlier raise the alarm or not. If you did, Jedore grows more annoyed her underlings are unable to kill a simple raiding party. Help the Phoenix Armor-clad krogan out, he's not hostile (to your team) but he only has a shotgun and won't be able to kill the mercs on his own; he can occasionally fire Carnage but his damage output's just not great. You face an initial two Troopers, followed by another two after they die. They have height advantage and modest cover above the wall, so also take advantage of the barricades on your end.
One is fodder for the other, who exactly it is is a mystery until you intervene
When the mercs are down the krogan (who is now identified as Tank-Grown Krogan) becomes selectable. Seeing as you're in an apparent dead end, talk to him. He explains he's just 7 days old, most of it in a ""kill everyone"" state, and ""something"" compels him to speak with you. Okeer has been mass-producing krogan and flash-indoctrinating them, but he keeps rejecting them for some reason, and you're speaking with one such reject, who repeatedly acknowledges he is ""not perfect"". You can learn more details as needed, and your squadmates interject at various points.
At the end of the conversation, you tell the krogan you need to speak with Okeer, his ""father"". He moves a massive panel on the wall to allow your squad into the research base. He will not come with you, however, so continue on. An autosave is generated as you regain control.
Research Base Outskirts[]
Be prepared for updates over the loudspeakers about your progress, how you are frustrating Jedore, and how her mercs are getting sloppy in that they can't take you out but can take out hundreds of reject krogan.
Good luck tanking all those Avenger bullets especially on Insanity
Pick up 2,000 credits from the dead Blue Suns merc before you move on. It's just a downward slope with a waist-high L-shaped barricade at the bottom, right? Not quite. As you proceed down the dirt path, be careful once you hear a member of your squad warn you about the lack of cover. Send your squad ahead of you because there will be two Troopers that appear suddenly around the corner as you approach the bottom of the sloping path. They're fleeing from krogan, but their weapons can easily shred your defenses in the wide open passage. By sending your squadmates ahead the Troopers may be distracted enough for you to run over to the sole block of cover around and attack from relative safety, though this method may trigger the spawning of enemies from the next area. Tip: You may want to save your ability cooldown to use Unity here.
On higher difficulty levels it is very possible for them to take out your squad or even you before you can find cover or neutralize them. Pulling out a heavy weapon to deal with regular grunts might seem like overkill, but in this particular instance it isn't. Although there is no formal cover at the top where you came from, you can back up past the opening where you entered and in doing so get out of the line of fire, but that is dependent on surviving long enough to retreat back that far.
Krogan Berserkers arrive in a constant stream through this area... run!
Once past this trap, you must pass through an oddly-shaped passage: multiple raised platforms joined together by metal slabs, with very little real cover and a lot of breakable crates you can lean out of once or twice before some stray bullet destroys them. There are two paths, though they converge in the middle for two platforms before splitting off again. The other side can be reached in 4-5 platforms depending on route taken.
This is yet another challenging area because the enemies here will continue to spawn for quite some time, initially alone then in pairs, approximately ten in total. On Insanity they will all be Krogan Berserkers, but on lower difficulties the earlier enemies will run the gamut of the Blue Suns arsenal except for Commanders. You have the choice to try to hold and kill them all, or stop them spawning by gradually advancing past their spawn point. There is a medkit on one of the platforms next to a dead Blue Sun merc. Tip: It is even possible to avoid fighting the enemies entirely if you are quick, flexible, and follow the correct path (left branch first, then right branch). This is a viable approach even on Insanity, and once the timing is learned can be done consistently and doesn't require special abilities. Walk when krogan aren't shooting you, run when they are, and take cover briefly in the middle.
Friendly once-a-mission reminder that you don't need to subject yourself to shooting slogs since experience gain is per mission not per kill
Keep advancing if you can. If you choose this path, consider then leaving one squadmate behind to cover your back as you and the other squadmate get past the bridges and beyond to deactivate the spawning—you will hear a voiceover when you reach the spawn point, but if you reach the refined platinum (+2000) that's additional confirmation you're done. Another viable strategy is to sprint there quickly and then optionally take the remaining krogan out from behind, or just leave them in the dust.
You should see some stairs once you're past the platforms. Go up the stairs; you don't have to worry about enemies for a few moments so this area and the next few ones are viable manual save points. The door at the end requires bypass, so have at it. An autosave is generated after solving it. Afterward it's another flight of stairs, ending on what appears to be some makeshift living quarters, though while getting there radio chatter has some mercs looking for Jedore to reinforce them as they're under attack from krogan.
Room with a view (and garbage planet smell)
The living quarters is sealed, but you'll be picking up hostiles beyond the door, so saving's disabled for now. Note:  This goes on for a couple more areas beyond this one, so you may need to backtrack out of radar range if you find yourself in a pinch. The room contains a medi-gel dispenser, power cells, and a scannable sniper rifle for the Scram Pulsar research line.
Outside the room is a single Trooper, whose back is turned toward you so for a split-second you have the element of surprise. He's also standing conveniently next to a bottomless chasm for any physics attack you might be thinking. On the other side of the chasm from him are two Heavies and a Trooper. Both sides have fragile crates you can destroy to reduce cover options, though the area's layout still makes this a long-range fight conducted by occasionally leaning out of rails.
The area after this is two square rooms guarded by an initial two Troopers, then from the second room's door emerge two Troopers and two Heavies, followed by another Trooper plus a Blue Suns Centurion.
Some guys love spamming bullets, these guys love spamming missiles
Be careful when entering this area because the mercs come out fast. Send in your squad first to pin them down for a few seconds, and then follow them in. Move your squad up when you can to the rail that protects you from ""falling"" into the abyss. If you're unable to prevent them from gaining a foothold, the first room's waist-high barricades is sufficient for a slow skirmish of attrition. This is once again a conventional long-distance fight with both sides blasting at each other in between ducking from rails or barricades.
Once the mercs are down proceed to the door. Opposite it, where the Heavies usually hung out, is someone's sleeping cot and a hackable PDA (+4,000 credits).
Troopers, Heavies, Legionnaires and Centurions defend this area
Beyond the door is another flight of stairs up, and another generated autosave. Over loudspeakers Jedore orders her men to kill the trespassers while she deals with Okeer, who has been releasing tank-breds without authorization. There are two doorways above, but one is barricaded. There's also a med kit near some sleeping cots in front of the doorway. The area is full of waist-high cover but protection goes both ways as your enemies are likely to have initial control of them. Enemy composition is initially a few Troopers and Heavies, then Blue Suns Legionnaires. When you advance a little further to the L barricade some more Troopers and Centurions show up on the far side. Again with all the bullet and missile spam you'll probably be spending a lot of time leaning out to fire or use your powers instead of a running battle.
Exiting this kill box you'll encounter a Blue Suns corpse with 2,000 credits and a bridge to the next area. BE CAREFUL because you will encounter a lot of mercs covering the bridge and the next area.
The area has double doses of everything: turian Troopers, human Troopers, Heavies, and Legionnaires
Initial composition will be two turian Troopers, who wield shotguns instead of assault rifles, then regular human Troopers, then two Heavies hanging back in the room beyond. The bridge has a lot of cover but it will be useless with close-range specialists around, so eliminating the turians is a priority. The hostiles in this area have a habit of just squatting down behind cover and will not fire forward. Watch where you send your squadmates in order to keep up the pressure.
When you've advanced far enough on the bridge surprise, the Heavies aren't alone and two Legionnaires suddenly appear to reinforce them. By this point you should have control of the bridge so you have plenty of fallback positions available.
Once you're done with them it's time to get lootin'. The area they were guarding appears to be another makeshift sleeping facility, so there are a bunch of thermal clips, power cells, and a wall safe (4,000 credits). Towards the west is a door leading to another set of stairs that go up, but before going up there's a hackable datapad (4,000 credits) around the bend just a few steps further west, next to a corpse.
Research Base Defenses[]
Blue Suns valiantly hold the line
Going up the stairs and opening the next door leaves you facing a metal hill that as you would expect has 4 Troopers on top of it, hugging the numerous metal slabs for cover. Over loudspeaker Jedore is getting annoyed her mercs aren't doing their jobs since your squad aren't dead yet, while on radio her mercs would rather she get off the speakers and fight. Move out with your squad and take out the mercs.
From the door both ways forward go to higher elevations. The hill in front of you (east) is basically a pit stop for the plain on your right (south), which leads to stairs going north on the far side. The far side is protected by two Legionnaires, a Heavy, and two more Troopers, so it's recommended you kill the mercs per area before proceeding as the combined firepower and flanking risks might be too overwhelming. If you need more thermal clips aside from enemy drops, some of the Blue Suns corpses there (the ones already dead before you came in) have nearby clips.
You should probably fear the day Vindicators begin shooting rockets, but it is not this day
When you reach the front of the stairs radio chatter indicates the mercs are losing ground to both you and Okeer's wild krogan. You may need to take advantage of nearby cover as there are still two Troopers: one on the bridge at the top of the stairs, another below (the Trooper below may fall back to support the next group of enemies). Once they're dead take the bridge get ready for another crouching shootfest against two Centurions below and two Heavies on an unreachable platform near your next destination. Jedore once more graces the loudspeakers and muses she has to do everything herself when none of her underlings report back.
Don't celebrate just yet when they're all down, as you descend the stairs there's another group to fight on your right (east): another Centurion, two Troopers, and a Heavy. When they're down though you can rest easy as they're the last ones for this segment. There's a spacious alley south of them (opposite the door) that leads to an area overlooking the plain earlier, but has no loot or enemies to clear out, so ignore it and just proceed through the door.
Research Base[]
Rana Thanoptis seems to have a few skeletons in the closet
Just inside the base what will happen depends solely on your import of Mass Effect. If you allowed Rana Thanoptis from Saren's base on Virmire to live, she can tell you what was happening here and how she survived. You have to let her leave and she tells you she is running because she ""knows how you work."" Otherwise this is simply an empty antechamber with goodies. Regardles of Rana's presence, there's a medical station by the next door and a secure terminal you can hack for 4,000 credits.
Unlike in the first game, Rana is an optional encounter this time around and you can ignore her. By talking to Okeer in the next room though you will lock out her room, so there's no reason other than roleplay to not interact with her. Saving in this room is a good idea in light of the interactions you'll soon be getting.
The door beyond Rana's office leads to Okeer himself and his laboratory. He greets you as you come in and reveals he has been watching your progress. At the far end there's a locked door that stays locked until you talk to Okeer, as well as a terminal you can bypass for a Krogan Vitality research upgrade.
Okeer has one last card up his sleeve (so to speak)
When you finally converse with Okeer he has been impatiently waiting as you play around with the ""idiotic"" mercs. Threaten him or not, he knows whoever sent you needs him alive for some reason. He knows who you are, as all krogan should know about Shepard and their actions on Virmire. Whatever your response, he approves of the genophage cure's destruction there because his creation will render it irrelevant. The one krogan in the room with him, still in its tank, is the ""perfect"" krogan and his legacy. If you explore the investigate options in the conversation he tells you that he has been producing the tank-breds in search of the perfect krogan, and providing an army for Jedore that consists of his rejects. He says they are going wild because she lacks the ability to command them.
Okeer wants to strike a bargain for a way out of Jedore's thumb but doesn't want to stake his prototype for it. However, Jedore comes over the PA announcing that Okeer released the krogan, and she begins to unleash krogan-killing gas intending to start over. Incensed, Okeer wants to barter his knowledge of the Collectors in exchange for stopping Jedore. He will stay behind and ""do what he must"" to protect his legacy, as it is irreplaceable and cannot be duplicated.
Jedore[]
You'll be running around in circles in a square room
Go down the stairs and save your game BEFORE you open the door. Once you open the door, take cover immediately behind the birthing tanks because there are three types of enemies in this room. Jedore herself is armed with a rocket launcher and a YMIR Mech. One of your squadmates will remark on seeing her in the flesh, as talkative as ever. Some krogan will periodically break free from the tanks and attack you and your squad. The krogan are the greatest threat because all have shotguns and usually will bypass your squadmates and go straight for you.
Take down the krogan. There will be four on Insanity, spawning one at a time. Alternately, take out Jedore quickly and the krogan will stop spawning.
Combat Strategy: This fight can seem complicated because there are a lot of enemy types moving around, but it can actually be broken down into several fairly simple steps and accomplished with little risk.
Have fun dodging shotgun blasts, missiles, berserk krogan AND a roaming walking minigun
For the first part you will want to stay up on the top platform you enter on. There are two good places to take cover: behind the roughly L-shaped location halfway down the platform, and behind the box 45-degrees diagonal at the far end of the platform just before the one respawning piece of ammo. From either of these locations you can safely take cover from both Jedore and the YMIR Mech, and thus you can concentrate exclusively on the krogan.
As each krogan spawns, watch which way it wants to approach your platform, and dash down to the cover at the *other* end. Take pot shots at the krogan when you can, mainly trying to burn their armor off. Once the armor is gone a flame ability like Incinerate or the biotic Warp ability can be used to disable their regeneration ability.
If you lose track of how many krogan have spawned, look at the number of upright tanks on Jedore's initial location. There are four tanks. Slanted tank means there's an undeployed krogan inside, upright tank means the krogan inside has been unleashed.
When the krogan reaches your platform you will have a clear line of sight to it. Immediately unload with everything you and your squad have to take it down. Emergency abilities such as Throw and Concussive Shot can knock it off its feet if needed.
After lather-rinse-repeat for four total krogan, head to the end of the platform with the diagonal box and take cover there if you aren't there already. This is the safest spot to take on the mech. It will tend annoyingly to keep the breeding tank between you and it, but you will have plenty of chances to shoot it if you are patient, or you can quickly pop out if you dare.
Once Jedore is the only one left, it's safe to proceed down from the platform. You'll find three more ammo spots below, and Jedore's rockets will miss you as long as you are running. Find a good spot and take her down—she doesn't hide very well and won't last long against sustained fire.
Or you can play smart and sensibly reduce unnecessary risks by funnelling enemies into a singular safe killzone, especially if you've barely begun upgrading your defenses and arsenal
Alternative Strategy: A safe—though probably more tedious—way to conduct this fight is not to enter the room at all. The door has a very short closing threshold; barely two steps in either direction and it will close. The krogan will come one at a time and can leave the room if the door is open. The YMIR will probably not leave the room because it can shoot at you from inside. Jedore will not leave the far side of the room to close distance because she is using a rocket launcher. Therefore, if you can handle one krogan at a time, you can just wait outside the room and let the door shut to have respite at any time.
Once everyone is down, a squadmate may comment about some alarms. EDI informs you that the lab where you left Okeer is filling up with toxins, fast. Hightail it back to the lab; on your way the lab computer will tell you that the emergency vents are kicking in.
Unfortunately it is too late, Okeer is already on the floor dead. As soon as you enter Okeer's final words play at his computer console, describing that he didn’t know what the Collectors had planned for the human colonists. He does ask you to protect his legacy, the perfect krogan soldier. After accessing his console, a few interesting squadmate comments follow, depending on who you brought with you. Shepard then calls the Normandy and explains that Okeer is a no go, but there's a package for pickup instead. And he's a big one.
Normandy[]
The first thing you encounter back on the Normandy is Jacob and Miranda arguing over the ""new paperweight"" you received from Okeer. You can either play nice or remind them both that this is your ship and your decision; you can also discuss security precautions for the new guest with some input from EDI. Regardless of what you say, don't worry as it won't actually have any impact on the fate of the tank's occupant, though some morality points can be earned. With the debate concluded, you are now free to head to the port cargo hold on the Engineering Deck to wake the krogan. You may also speak with Kelly Chambers first for some cautionary words from her about the tank.
Dr. Okeer's Legacy[]
Letting him out is a no-brainer, keeping him sealed is peak sigma Shepard
Strictly speaking, this is a separate mission from here and can be done later. EDI likewise warns you of the risks of opening the tank and you can ask a few other questions. If you decide a potential krogan ally is too valuable to pass up, open the tank and meet ""Grunt"". However, it is also possible to leave the tank unopened and even reach the end of the game having never released him. Leaving Grunt in the tank for the time being can have some advantages that aren't immediately obvious, such as delaying certain mission triggers from occuring or speeding up the unlocking of certain loyalty missions.
If released, Grunt emerges and his first act—somewhat unsurprisingly—is to charge and slam Shepard against a wall. Choose your dialogue options carefully and if your Paragon or Renegade scores are high enough, options will appear to persuade Grunt to fight for you or join your ""clan"" depending on your choices. The scene eventually pulls back to reveal that Shepard was holding a pistol to Grunt's stomach the entire time; on noticing, Grunt approves that you ""Offer one hand, but arm the other.""
Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the tank.
If persuasion dialogue choices are not made, Shepard will be forced to use the pistol (optionally via Renegade interrupt) in a more direct manner to ""convince"" Grunt to back down. He appears severely wounded, but with krogan regenerative powers he is able to quickly recover. Regardless of conversation choices, Grunt is impressed by Shepard's demonstrations of strength, and he joins your team as its newest member. Multiple morality points are available from the confrontation."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Dossier:_The_Assassin,"Prerequisite: Horizon (mission)
After the mission on Horizon, the Illusive Man provides a second batch of team-building dossiers. This is one of them.
Thane Krios

- Quick-kill biotic specialist
- Expert sniper

Thane Krios is a drell trained from childhood as an elite assassin, proficient in both long-range sniping kills and close infiltration. He has slowed his activities in recent years but is rumored to have a target on Illium.","On your first visit to Illium, an asari concierge named Careena, accompanied by two LOKI Mechs, greets Shepard upon arrival. She informs you that Liara T'Soni has paid for the Normandy's docking and administrative fees and that Liara would like to speak with Shepard. After the chat with Careena EDI advises Shepard that Liara may have information on Thane's location.
Liara can be found in the admin office overlooking the trading floor. Go there and speak to her. As this is a reunion with your former squadmate you may have to discuss a few matters first before you can proceed to the business of progressing this mission. Those other matters can be tabled for later. As an information broker Liara can point you to the relevant people for recruiting Thane Krios or Samara, so ask about the former.
Liara tells Shepard that Thane arrived a few days ago and his target is a corporate executive, Nassana Dantius. You may be acquainted with Nassana depending on choices made in Mass Effect. Thane contacted an asari named Seryna, who has an office in the cargo transfer levels. Follow the lead to Seryna's office.
Getting to Thane[]
That's the look of a disgruntled ex-employee with nothing to lose
Seryna's office is under the shipping sign. You learn that Seryna is a disgruntled former employee of Nassana, who was dismissed after confronting her boss about her routine assassinations of her enemies. If you imported a Mass Effect game with UNC: Asari Diplomacy accomplished, you tell Seryna you killed Nassana's own sister on her behalf. Thane learned about Nassana's security from Seryna, and she wants to help anyone who will help Thane kill Nassana.
Nassana is in the penthouse of Tower One of the Dantius Towers. Seryna believes that Thane will likely infiltrate through Tower Two, which is still under construction. She describes Nassana's paranoia of killers, and rightfully so given her business practices. Seryna volunteers to take your team to the Dantius Towers, and you're given a choice to proceed or back out for now. If you back out, talk to her again when you're ready. You can only go to the Towers once, and once you're there you cannot return to Nos Astra without first completing the mission.
Dantius Tower Two Entrance[]
Driving people willing to safeguard someone who wants to kill your old boss is an indicator of how dangerously trigger-happy said boss is
When you agree to go, a cutscene plays where Seryna flies your team via skycar to the towers. You can ask Seryna for further details about the destination and waiting defenses: as many Eclipse mercs as Nassana's money could buy, and there are no static emplacements, only moving ones.
After being dropped off at the bottom of Tower Two, your team quickly encounters a bunch of security mechs gunning down panicked salarian construction workers. Once you regain control, quickly activate ammo powers and other combat prep. A thin sheet of glass at the entrance separates you from the mechs, once they break past it simply by moving towards you they start shooting. This initial group is composed of 2 LOKI Mechs and 2 FENRIS Mechs. There are no cover positions in this starting area.
Once the mechs have been disposed of, check out the room to the left where you can find a medical station with medi-gel and a hackable Terminal (+4800 credits).
The first of up to 7 salarians you can save. Encountering him is mandatory, the rest are optional
After collecting the loot, head back out and straight across, where you will encounter a wounded salarian by a door. The worker will explain that Nassana sent the dog mechs to round up all the night workers to get rid of them immediately. A Paragon interrupt uses some medi-gel to stabilize him; not taking it will lead to some morality choices, two of which will result in letting the salarian die. Saving the salarian lets you learn more information from him, including a good picture of what to expect on your upcoming trip through the towers.
Level 1[]
After dealing with the salarian in whichever way you choose, go through the door and down the hall. Be prepared to take cover as soon as you exit. Eclipse mercs and a passel of mechs will attack you. The initial group is composed of 2 Eclipse Troopers, 2 LOKIs and a FENRIS. You will fight more of the same until you reach the way to the next level.
Seven mutts will need to be put out of their misery
This begins a long series of fights around and through a U-shaped level. Take cover and eliminate the 24 enemies as they come along. Be careful throughout the level, and also the entire mission, as the mercs are fond of shooting at you and your squad from the flanks. At each of the corners, send your squad ahead of you to flush out the enemies, but keep your squadmates in cover. As long as you move forward slowly, you will also get several ""breaks"" between waves of enemies, during which any downed squadmates will revive for free.
It's advisable to concentrate on the mechs first in each wave, as they are the only enemies which will attempt to approach to dangerously close ranges - target the fast-moving FENRIS mutts first, and then LOKI mechs.
Once you round the second corner there are two corridors that the Eclipse mercs will attack from. One has cover and the other doesn’t. One option is to use your squad to pin down the mercs, then either send one squadmate or go yourself to flank the mercs and reach the ramp at the end of the level. Note:  If you take cover right at the ""turning point"" of the U-shaped level, you can cover the entrances of both corridors. Most of the enemies, especially the mechs, will helpfully come toward you while you mow them down from safety. Whittling them down until there are only one or two left will make the process of advancing to flush out the last holdouts far less dangerous.
When you finally reach the end of the corridor, head up the ramp to level 2.
Level 2[]
PROTIP: Thane's giving you a hint, use the surrounding area to make a stand and fill it with more Eclipse corpses
An autosave is generated as you enter the next level. At the top of the ramp and past a door there will be two med-kits with medi-gel, thermal clips, and ambient Eclipse chatter coming from above. One guard admonishes another for being too lazy to patrol, but he never realizes his error as someone beats him up then dumps his corpse to your level, courtesy of a ventilation tube.
Tip: If you're already at maximum medi-gel capacity, leave the two med-kits on the ground for now, in case of emergencies. You'll be able to return here and replenish your medi-gel any time before you enter the elevator at the end of the level.
Once you engage the mercs you will encounter up to 8 distinct enemy waves coming along the corridors and rooms of the level. Each wave consists of 5 units. Odd-number waves are made up of 3 Troopers and 2 LOKIs, while even-number waves consist of 2 LOKIs, 2 Troopers, and one tough male Eclipse Vanguard with barriers. Between each wave you'll usually have a moment to grab thermal clips, move up a bit, etc, but you will not be able to save until all are eliminated.
The cover options suck, but at least they'll all come to you eventually
The onslaught begins when you move out of the two doorways beyond the dropped Eclipse corpse. Enemy behavior is to beeline to your position: Succeeding waves will go to you, even if they walk slowly in case of the LOKIs. The next wave spawns when the current wave is sufficiently destroyed, and each spawn is farther down the level. The first 4 waves easily spawn one after another, the later ones may require you to push farther along the level for them to trigger.
Combat Strategy: This entire section can be completed much easier by parking yourself and squadmates in the initial area where you came in, near the 2 med-kits. Most waves will come to you anyway, and you can have Shepard peek around the corner, use weapons and powers to chip away at the mercs through all of the waves and even the Vanguards won't charge you. You will have to move up to trigger additional waves but can run back to the starting section to take them down safely.
Take them on through the corridor, or take the alternate route to sidestep a few of them
If you wish to fight this conventionally, use the cover and move when necessary to take out the attacking mercs -- as before it's best take out the mechs first. The safest plan is to start behind the first low cover that faces the L-shaped cover at the end of the area - this covers both of the directions enemies will approach and keeps you from getting flanked. When things calm down you can approach the L-shaped cover and face another wave of enemies.
You now have two options, either go straight up the hall (directly confronting the waves of foes) or go through the door back and to the right to reach a fairly safe flanking position that tend to separate you from your squad but will let you mow down enemies crossing an area with little cover. Once the mercs are down take a second to gather clips and reload. There is also a med-kit with medi-gel just after the two paths converge. The next area is complicated because of the narrow entryway but creative and intelligent usage of squadmates can help in this situation.
These might be useful
Once the mercs stop coming, explore a little. Do not access the elevator yet. Go to the other side from where you entered and down the hallway. Here there is the rapid-fire M-97 Viper sniper rifle, some power cells, and a hackable Terminal (+4200 credits).
Warning:  If you pick up the M-97 Viper at this point, Shepard and any other squadmates with a sniper rifle will automatically change models to the Viper as well. With the upcoming elevator battle, you may not want to get the Viper at this point if you prefer a different sniper rifle. You can pick up a second Viper in the next section, or simply return to this after the elevator fight.
Tell your assassin to aim for her head... 'cause she doesn't have a heart!
Go back and bypass a nearby door to find some salarian workers: Daroth, Shelum, and their coworker. The salarians will tell Shepard that someone who was not an Eclipse mercenary locked them in the room. You can earn some morality points with the conversation, depending on your choices. Inside the room is a med-kit and a secure locker (+3000 credits).
Now it's time to deal with the elevator. Before you do, put your squad in cover. Tip: If you stick one squadmate behind each of the cover locations on the left and right of the elevator, it will help keep the enemies from dispersing rapidly when they emerge.
""Mezzanine. Have a pleasant day.""
Next, activate the elevator. You have a few seconds before the elevator opens, so take cover immediately: one good spot is to climb over the L-shaped cover in the middle rear directly facing the elevator, but if you prefer having an easy retreat you'll want to be somewhere with a corridor at your back. A krogan Bounty Hunter and two Eclipse Engineers will come out of the elevator. Using the Arc Projector or the M-100 Grenade Launcher can be helpful here, particularly when the elevator first opens and the enemies are all clumped up together. It's safest to start by concentrating on the Engineers and eliminating them one at a time - they're much weaker than the Bounty Hunter and taking them down eliminates the danger of their drones zapping you out of cover at an awkward moment.
Combat Strategy: There is no reason to put your squadmates into cover right near the elevator. Put them into cover far back into the hallway leading into the elevator room. You can then activate the elevator and run back to your squadmates. There's plenty of space to retreat into if needed and take this battle slowly and carefully.
Once all the enemies are down, you have a moment to return for any medi-gel you left in reserve, the M-97 Viper (if you want it now) and grab any ammo left. When you're ready, take the elevator up.
Level 3[]
Watch that first step!
When you exit the elevator you'll find an Eclipse Trooper communicating with his superiors. Shepard interrupts and the merc turns around to see three weapons pointing at him. The conversation that follows gives you a few morality points and a Renegade interrupt. Using the Renegade interrupt sends the merc through the window, but if you let the merc live you can persuade him to talk or simply let him go. Either Paragon or Renegade option results in the merc relaying hearsay about Thane's position as Eclipse really don't know where he is, so you allow him to walk away without further consequence. Even if the merc warned he's got nearby buddies who can shoot you down, no such enemies immediately follow up whatever the outcome.
Regardless of how you handled the lone merc, head over to a datapad on the floor. The datapad contains the Kirosa genetic database for the Salarian Family Data assignment.
With enemies spread wide in a large area, make every explosive count
Open either of the doors into the next room, which is large, open, has plenty of cover, and more than a few explosive containers. It's the unfinished top of Tower Two, and one more level above this room is the bridge that leads to Nassana's penthouse in the other tower. If you enter quietly you can hear conversation between Nassana and her hired help. They think Thane's traveling through the ducts as they've been receiving multiple reports on several levels, although some of that might be your team's fault.
The room has an initial enemy count of 2 LOKIs and 2 FENRIS mechs, in 2 undeployed groups of 1 each. 1 Trooper enters the room from the ramp at the far end once the mechs become active, followed by another Trooper and an asari Eclipse Vanguard when the first few units have been destroyed or when you're near enough to the ramp. The mechs unfold when you reach the first barricades from the doors or when you or your team start shooting. Tip: Once in cover, Overload the big explosive container if possible, and then target one of the two FENRIS mechs so that it can't dislodge you from cover; then take down any LOKI mechs for similar reasons.
There is no need to go running into the room and get torn the shreds. Place your squadmates into cover / squatting down at the starting point of this section. You can walk forward to one of the doors (it will open automatically), use weapons and powers on the mercs / mechs, and then move back to the starting hallway to recharge shields. Be aware that the enemies can follow Shepard through the doors! Chip away at the enemies and soon they will all fall.
""I'll do it! I'll do it! Please don't make me do it...""
Once the Eclipse Mercs are dealt with go to the door on the left side of the room and bypass the door. When the door opens a terrified salarian points a pistol at you. A quick Renegade interrupt will cause you to punch the salarian, but it may be better to wait it out. No matter your choices, the armed salarian, Telon, will fall unconscious and his brother, Chesith, rushes to his aid. The conversation tells you how they were threatened by a Merc, whose head then exploded and Telon took his gun. Once the conversation is over, the room contains a med-kit and a hackable PDA (+6000 credits) on an Eclipse mercenary corpse.
Head back out and before the ramps up to the roof and bridge, there are power cells, a comm terminal, and the second M-97 Viper in case it wasn't taken earlier. The terminal provides some options for annoying Nassana but no morality points. Head up the ramps to the roof and the bridge to Tower One.
Tip: You don't have to take the second Viper at this point if Shepard/squadmates have sniper rifles that you prefer. You can come back down the stairs after the upcoming battle and then pick up the Viper. There is a weapons locker to change back to your preferred sniper rifle in this section after you pick it up.
Roof and Bridge[]
Feel free to let loose with heavy weapons as there's a weapons locker nearby
Get into cover fast because there are flanking enemies on your left. Two mechs provide a screen for three Vanguards, so this can be a sharp fight. Use what cover you have to take out the enemies. Move up when you get the opportunity to get to the pillars and crates on the opposite side from where you entered.
Combat Strategy: There is no need to stay in the battle area to get cut to ribbons. Set your squadmates into cover / squatting at the bottom of the staircase leading to the battle area. You can then run up the staircase, trigger the LOKI mechs and Vanguards, and then draw them down the staircase. The LOKI mechs will follow you down the staircase but the Vanguards tend to stay up top in cover. Chip away at all of the enemies using weapons and powers and run back down the staircase at any point you need to recharge your shields. Note that because this is a wide open space if the Vanguards are ragdolled into the floor below they may still live, necessitating the need for you to head back the ramp and shoot them down.
Once all the mercs are down, move up and take the refined eezo crate (+500 eezo) and if you need new weapons, use the Weapons Locker. Also don’t forget to pick up the med-kit with just to the left of the locker. This is a good save point.
More explosions = more players
Around the corner, if you are careful you can avoid being detected until you start shooting, and if you shoot or overload the big explosive container first you'll do massive damage to the two mercs standing right by it. Be careful in this area because in addition to the LOKIs, Troopers, and the last human Vanguard of the mission, there is an Eclipse Commando who has both barrier and armor. The area has little room for your squad to take cover or maneuver. Concentrate on one enemy at a time, in what ever order they present themselves.
Combat Strategy: There is no need to stay in the battle area to get cut to ribbons. Set your squadmates into cover / squatting near the weapons locker. Shepard can then peek around the corner, trigger mercs and mechs, and then chip away using weapons and powers safely from around the corner. The LOKI mechs will come around the cover in the area so back up if you need to get help from your squadmates but the mercs tend to stay in cover. Run back into the weapons locker area at any point you need to recharge your shields.
Looks like a straight shot, right? Nope, you'll fight every inch of the way to the other side
Once the mercs are down go to the end and there will be a submachine gun upgrade, another med-kit, and a hackable PDA (+12000 credits) on another dead Eclipse mercenary corpse. Warning:  Be sure to loot everything, change your weapon configurations if you want, and/or save your game before heading to the bridge entry point. The ledge drop next to the last set of items is a point of no return.
The bridge to Tower One is a long narrow walkway that is ideal for sniper rifles and certain assault rifles. The initial enemy count is 3 LOKIs, a Vanguard, and a Troopers. When Nassana orders nobody will cross the bridge 2 Troopers and a Vanguard then spawn at the far end of the bridge. Pay attention whenever Nassana speaks, as that is a sign another set of enemies are deployed. The spawns from here onward are Troopers and Vanguards, unless noted.
Enemies will fly left and right with the right combination of powers
It is possible to use powers to knock enemies off for instant-kills. Move from cover to cover on the shaky bridge until you start taking rocket fire. At the opposite end of the bridge are two stationary Rocket Drones (turns out Seryna's intel is slightly inaccurate). They start firing long before they become ""targetable"" by powers. This presents problems in using squad powers or the Missile Launcher, because Shepard will often lock onto another target even if pointed at one of the rocket drones. However the drones only have shields so once the shields are down they're gone.
Class Tip: Infiltrators with Incinerate can throw the plasma bolts over very long distances using a sniper rifle. Zoom into one of the rocket drones using any sniper rifle and place the crosshairs on the body of the rocket drone. While still zoomed in, throw an Incinerate bolt at the rocket drone, and it will strike the drone. (Use a hot-button / hot-key to use the power without going to the power wheel). You'll know you hit the drone when it starts firing rockets back at Shepard. Using this method, you can continuously throw Incinerate bolts safely from cover until the drones fall without having to be far up the bridge. Note:  This long distance Incinerate tactic works at any time on any enemy in any other mission as well even when very far away. As long as you can see the enemy clearly, you can hit them. If you are close enough but still out of target lock, the target lock can actually show up in sniper zoom, and the plasma bolt will curve to hit the enemy. This tactic doesn't work if the enemy is behind cover though.
This would have been a good defensive setup if you're in a tower defense game
Once you have cleared the bridge of enemies, get into cover at the end of the bridge but not the wall, because another wave will appear on upper level of the bridge leading to Tower One’s penthouse. Take these guys out before you go up the stairs, or you will regret it no matter what difficulty you are on. Once they are out send your squad up the stairs but keep them close to the right and equip a short range weapon as another shotgun-armed Eclipse Commando awaits in a confined space as the last barrier to Nassana’s Penthouse. If you can, use your squad to fire from cover, but most of the time you have to lure the Commando away so you can fire on her from cover. The Commando will not follow you back down the stairs so stay on the upper level and retreat if necessary to regenerate shields and health.
Once the Commando and any other mercs are down, the combat portion of the mission is over. Enter Nassana’s Penthouse when you have nothing more to do in the area.
Nassana's Penthouse[]
Once you open the door, the few remaining Eclipse mercs, tending to Nassana herself, raise their weapons. Nassana turns around and comments in shock ""Shepard, but you’re dead!"", at which point Shepard will humorously respond by saying ""I got better.""
Now you see him...
There is more dialogue with Nassana if your Shepard is imported from a Mass Effect save (provided that you did the related side assignment). She is shocked to see Shepard again, then comments on the irony that she had Shepard kill her sister back in 2183, and now it's her turn.
Nassana asks Commander Shepard who hired Shepard to kill her; she disbelieves that the commander is not there to kill her due to the recent rampage. A subsequent noise distracts the mercs and Nassana tells them to check all the other entrances. Clearly she is even more paranoid than she was described. Thane is waiting in the ventilation ducts for the right moment. Once the mercs have their backs to the windows, he makes his move.
...Now you don't
Thane jumps down from the ducts and kills one merc silently by snapping his neck, then he immediately kills another with a quick punch in the neck and proceeds to shoot the last of Nassana's mercs before he grabs her herself. He shoves his pistol into Nassana's gut and pulls the trigger at point-blank range, causing Nassana to slump dead. Thane gently places her on the desk and folds her arms, before he starts praying over Nassana's dead body. At this point, you can start speaking with Thane by choosing to be nice or angry that he is ignoring you.
During the conversation, Thane comments on how he was working his way up and how you provided a great distraction that allowed him to get further and faster than he had hoped, to which you can respond however you like. After that, you can tell Thane about the suicide mission and that you need his help to bring down the Collectors. Interestingly, Thane has little problem with being on a mission that will likely result in death, because he admits that he is dying regardless and wishes to make the universe a brighter place before his death, but assures that his condition is not contagious and will not affect his performance. Thane then agrees to work for Shepard for no charge, after which the conversation will end and you will automatically be returned to the Normandy."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Garrus:_Eye_for_an_Eye,"Prerequisite: Horizon (mission)
You automatically acquire this mission after completing a few missions and/or assignments following the mission on Horizon. Kelly Chambers reports that Garrus has received a message that ""put some fire in his eyes"". Talk to Garrus at his station in the Normandy's weapons batteries. He says he has new information on Sidonis, the turian who sold out his team on Omega, leading to their deaths.","During the initial talk with Garrus, he says he has arranged a meeting with Fade in a warehouse near the Neon Markets in Zakera Ward. It's in the Shipping Warehouse on Level 26.
Arrival on the Citadel[]
Discount ""Fade"" and his discount muscle
Upon your arrival at the Citadel, EDI advises Shepard to talk to C-Sec. This is completely optional: because Garrus already told you where the meeting would take place you can head straight to the warehouse without consulting C-Sec. If you wish to follow EDI's advice, go talk to Captain Bailey, and he says that Fade has contacts in the warehouses.
Inside the warehouse is a volus with two krogan bodyguards. Garrus is required to be with the party when going to the warehouse, else you will not see these three guys. Talk to the volus. You can use a Renegade interrupt, causing Shepard and Garrus to shoot the bodyguards dead. Otherwise, they draw their guns, scaring the bodyguards off. The volus tells them Fade is a former C-Sec officer named Harkin and that he can be found in the old prefab factory in the Factory District, but he's protected by Blue Suns mercenaries. Shepard lets the volus go, but Garrus warns that if they don't find Harkin then they will be back for him. Head out of the warehouse and use a Rapid Transit terminal to go to the Factory District.
Factory District[]
Did Harkin pick the name ""Fade"" because of his substance abuse history?
At the Factory District, Shepard meets Harkin and two Blue Suns troopers. Harkin, noticing Shepard and Garrus, flees leaving the two Blue Suns mercenaries. The cutscene places you in cover so use it and take out the Blue Suns. Go through the door and search the trash to the left for 600 credits. The table across from the entrance has a med kit on it. To the left two LOKI Mechs will suddenly emerge from the blue shipping container. Take them out before they have a chance to hurt you and then use the elevated cover to combat more Blue Suns and LOKI Mechs as you move through the area.
Use the elevated cover in this area as much as you can, but keep an eye out for flankers, especially the mechs, as they persistently try to walk around the cover to get to you. Combat Tip: Generally give priority targeting to mechs for this reason - the Blue Suns mostly won't move to flank you.
Move along until you reach a narrowing in the path. On the right is another shipping container that will produce more mechs when you get close. Take them out and any others you missed and the area will be clear. Before moving on there is an easily-missed wall safe on the left that can be bypassed for 1,500 credits. Moving beyond the area, medi-gel, and a circuit board for 900 credits. This is a good point to save the game.
Moving Deeper[]
Blue Suns troopers and LOKI mechs exchange ""words"" with the Commander
While you are still getting the medi-gel and bypassing the circuit board Garrus will comment that Harkin is still here, he can smell it. Move across and take cover behind the crates and optionally use the elevated cover to the left. LOKI Mechs will be present, more will come from overhead, and even more will emerge from the shipping container on the right. On top of all that there are some Blue Suns that just don’t seem to get the message that you are coming through and open fire. Tip: You'll be tempted to take up position on the elevated cover as you come around the corner, but it can become a deathtrap when mechs are introduced on your right flank. Either stay back in the first place or be ready to pull back quickly - don't get overextended because pulling back too late from the mechs often exposes you to fire from the Blue Suns.
Take out the targets based on whatever system you use to rank threats, then when you get a chance move up and stay in cover. Use the pillars and crates further up but don’t go too far because an open container on your right has a Blue Sun Trooper in it wielding a shotgun. Take him out as you are moving up and then get in cover.
More LOKI Mechs will drop from the passing cranes and more Blue Suns mercenaries will appear at the other end, in several waves that can merge together if you advance too quickly. The final group includes a few Blue Suns Legionnaires along with the Troopers and mechs, so when the fighting gets toughest you'll know you're almost done.
Warning: Just because you're standing there when a wave goes down, do not go for the circuit boards on the right too quickly as sometimes a few more Blue Suns or mechs are due to spawn, and can shoot you in the middle of attempting a bypass. You can test if you're done by moving forward a bit, and as noted the appearance of the Legionnaires seems generally to signal the final phase of the fight.
Once no enemies appear, or you reach the power cells and medkit, then come back and bypass the two circuit boards for 900 credits each. Move into an area that resembles an office—well, it has a desk, anyway. In addition to the heavy weapon ammo and medi-gel, there is a laptop that can be hacked for 4,500 credits, and 2,000 units of iridium. Access the bridge controls, save your game and then proceed.
Beyond the Bridge[]
A Blue Suns commander and a YMIR mech have a ""gift"" for Garrus and the Commander
This next area use cover and watch out for the container on the right, more LOKI Mechs will emerge. This area has Blue Suns Troopers, a Blue Suns Commander, and LOKI Mechs. Take them out at range, then move up when you can. Tip: The enemies here come in several ""batches"", each activated when you reach a certain point. By eliminating each wave before moving up, you can ensure you don't face too many enemies at one time. There are also plenty of places to fall back to if things get too hot.
When you move up far enough your squadmates will say that something is incoming, which reveals itself as a YMIR Mech. If you have AI Hacking, then focusing your squad on knocking out the YMIR's shield and armor protections can give you the opportunity to convert the unprotected YMIR into an ally that makes taking out any other enemies a breeze. Otherwise, choose tactics appropriate to your weapons and squadmates. Use Garrus’ Overload to reduce the shields and disable the YMIR when you can. Above all, stay in cover and if you're taking point be sure not to get flanked by advancing enemies. Once they are all down move up and grab the medi-gel, and bypass the circuit board for 1,200 credits. Move into the office.
Inside before you access the shutter controls, pick up the power cells, bypass the wall safe for 2,100 credits, grab the medi-gel from the medical station, and go past the door on the right and hack the terminal for a sniper rifle damage upgrade. You can also find a forged ID on the desk. Go back and access the shutter controls and a cutscene will play where you get some information and Garrus spells out his intentions. You can express skepticism or offer your support, but this won't affect any later outcomes or award any morality points. Either way, move on.
Fade’s Hideout Exterior[]
Three LOKI mechs drop by to join in on the festivities
If you didn’t hack the terminal, do so now on your way out. The area outside is a mess of platforms at varying levels; EDI will announce that crates being carried overhead contain explosives, but she is mistaken: they are empty. For now stay on the floor and get in cover with your squad to the right of the raised platform. There will be a Blue Suns Trooper in the distance on an upper level platform to the left; it's impossible to physically reach him so just take him out from a distance. The elevated positions on the right side will usually contain a Blue Suns Commander and either a Legionnaire or a Heavy with a rocket launcher.
Endless LOKIs: In addition to the Blue Suns lying in wait, waves of three LOKI Mechs at a time will get dropped in periodically via overhead conveyor, with the first wave appearing soon after you enter this area. They can be spotted flying in from a distance to give you warning of their arrival. These waves spawn endlessly, but can be stopped in one of two ways: one is by killing all of the Blue Suns, and the second is by physically reaching the platform that leads up and out of the initial area (to the left and then straight ahead). As a practical matter, the latter method is dangerous if you don't take out at least a few of the mercs first as you'll be on the low ground and can get hit by all of them at once, but with the aid of a distraction such as a hacked LOKI it's doable. The very foot of the high platform is out of the line of fire of the Commander and the Heavy. In either case, you'll know when the LOKI waves have stopped spawning if you hear Harkin's line taunting you or Garrus, and then Garrus's response about making Harkin ""regret this.""
Combat Strategies:
A straightforward way to deal with this battle is to take it slow and deal with the Blue Suns one at a time yourself in between the LOKI waves. Leave your squad on the lowest level to the right of the raised platform where they will have clear line of sight to the LOKI's as they advance forward on the left side, and assist them in taking the mechs out when they show up. In between waves, climb up carefully and use powers, your squad's abilities, and weapons to wear down and take out each of the mercs in turn. Be especially careful of any Heavy as its rockets seek and take time to travel and you absolutely don't want to get hit while in the open. Always make sure you have a position to take cover from LOKIs when they arrive to the left so you don't get flanked.
If you're a sniper rifle type, then moving a bit to the left as you enter and staying well back behind the first row of boxes gives you a wide field of fire that takes in all the enemies. The new waves of mechs will drop safely far in front of you, and as long as they're far away you can safely pound away at the various Blue Suns.
You can also climb around in the crates on the right side and in doing so achieve positions where you can face only one or two enemies at a time, often at relatively close range. The mechs generally won't be able to get to you. This method is both appropriate and fun for shotgun-wielders.
Once all the attackers are down, move all the way to the right and behind three waist high crates is a datapad that you can hack for 1,200 credits. Once you get back from there the only way to proceed is going to the ground floor. Save your game here because of the opponents you are about to face. Once you start climbing the platforms, Harkin will come over the PA system saying that he’s not running from you (or alternatively, taunting Garrus if you never met Harkin prior to this mission). Once you make the right turn after the first platform get your squad into cover on the upper platform to your right. This area is perfect for the battle you are about to face. Just make sure they stay there. Once they are in cover move up to the end of the mid level platform and Harkin will play his trump card: two YMIR Mechs.
A YMIR mech seems oblivious to the fact that its partner has lost its head
While the YMIR Mechs are still dropping and deploying, if your squadmates came out of cover on the upper platform, put them back there and climb back up to join them yourself. If you take cover on the upper platform toward the back it will prevent the YMIR Mechs from flanking you and your squad the way that can happen if you get in cover on the lower levels. The YMIR Mechs can get stuck in the crates as they try to get to you but stay in cover and hit them hard each time they stop firing for a moment.
Combat Strategy: The biggest danger to you in this fight is bunching up too closely with your squadmates on the high platform; doing so can get you all killed by the mech rockets stunning everyone out of cover at once, which is very possible because squadmates aren't very smart about when they poke their heads up. Keep the safest cover on the high ground for yourself and send your teammates away from you, even if this means they are in more exposed positions. You alone should be enough to finish the mechs if you're careful and patient, though you can always revive your squad if you have medi-gel remaining.
Additional Tips:
If you have AI Hacking, you can damage one mech until its shields and armor are gone, then repeatedly hack it creating some hot mech-on-mech action where it kills (or is killed by) the other mech. Then finish off the remaining mech.
If you don't have AI Hacking, then simply focus your fire on the lead mech, then finish it with a headshot to trigger its critical overload. With luck, the ensuing explosion will either kill the remaining YMIR or severely damage it.
If you're equipped with the M-920 Cain and have enough ammo to use it, then you should fire it into the space in between the two YMIR Mechs as soon as you can. On lower difficulties the blast will instantly obliterate both of them, and even on Hardcore or Insanity, the blast will take out their shields and a good chunk of their armor, making the rest of the fight much easier. You should start charging the shot even before the mechs land, as it can be very difficult to charge the Cain once under fire from where you are.
Once you have a sense of where and when the YMIR Mechs deploy, it is actually possible to ""instakill"" them. When the crane that drops them spawns, shoot it or hit it with a power such as Overload or Concussive Shot; this should cause the mech to prematurely drop. If the crane was shot early enough, the YMIR will drop into a non-playable zone, resulting in an instant kill. Sniper rifles tend to make this task extremely easy.
Once the YMIR Mechs are down move up and Harkin will raise the six platforms in front of where he is hiding. Now you have to climb up to his position by the platforms on your left. His final defenders are two LOKI Mechs that will deploy from the top level and start walking down to you. Take them out and keep climbing. Warning:  Don't be lulled to sleep by the anticlimactic nature of this final encounter - the mechs have a considerable height and field-of-fire advantage over your group, so if you don't take them seriously and carefully the mission can end in an embarrassment.
Class Tips: As a Vanguard it is possible to dash to the left past the YMIR mechs and use Charge on one of the LOKI Mechs at the top of the platforms near the entrance to Harkin's room, simply charge them and deal with them and click the door to the room a few times and you can skip the difficult YMIR fight entirely. As an Engineer, it is possible to use the Combat Drone to activate the LOKI mechs early, during the YMIR fight. By then hacking them as they approach, a substantial distraction of the YMIRs can be achieved.
Once you reach the door at the far end of the area leading to where Harkin is hiding, a cutscene begins.
Fade’s Hideout[]
Archangel didn't come to play nice
As Shepard moves into position, Harkin is seen engaged in frenetic observation through the window. Noticing Shepard's approach, he turns and runs—only to be intercepted by Garrus, who proceeds to slam him against a nearby wall in none too gentle a fashion. When Garrus' purpose becomes clear, however, Harkin is not forthcoming with Sidonis' location; apparently ""it's bad for business."" In response, Garrus knocks him to the floor and pins him there with a foot to the throat, growling ominously that a broken neck is also bad for business. Harkin quickly yields to Garrus' persuasion; staggering to his feet, he stumbles to a nearby terminal to contact Sidonis, and a rendezvous is soon arranged for mid-day outside Orbital Lounge.
After severing communications Harkin makes a move to leave, but Garrus is not willing to overlook his former C-Sec colleague's criminality so easily. Taking aim with his pistol, Garrus suggests darkly that he doesn't mind slowing Harkin down. At this point, you can use a Paragon interrupt to stop Garrus from shooting Harkin in the leg. If you do, Garrus will deliver Harkin a violent headbutt as a parting shot instead. Regardless, Garrus ends the conversation with a threat to return and ""finish the job"" if Sidonis doesn't show.
Orbital Lounge[]
Sidonis in Garrus' sights
The squad takes a skycar to the Lounge and during the ride you can either support Garrus' planned revenge or try to talk him out of it. He doesn’t back down and Shepard asks what his plan is. Garrus points to a location where he will set up in a sniper perch. He tells Shepard to draw Sidonis out and he will take the shot. Garrus leaves the cab and it takes off. Down below, Sidonis is waiting and Shepard motions him over. This conversation starts with your dialogue choice to either warn Sidonis or allow Garrus to shoot him.
If you warn Sidonis that you are a friend of Garrus, he gets scared and begins to walk away. If you miss the Paragon interrupt, he dies. If you make the interrupt, Shepard warns him to stay still. A terrified Sidonis attempts to explain himself, claiming he only sold out Garrus' team to save his own skin. You can then allow Garrus to take the shot after all, or continue the conversation to learn that Sidonis has become haunted and depressed by his actions. If you have enough Paragon points, you can convince Garrus to spare him, or you can step aside for the last time. If you persuade Garrus to let Sidonis leave, Shepard tells him to go and that Garrus has given him a second chance. Sidonis expresses his gratitude to Garrus and walks away.
Once back at the skycar you can discuss the encounter with Garrus and then return to the Zakera Ward Dock.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Stop_the_Collectors,"Prerequisite: Freedom's Progress (mission)
This mission is acquired automatically after the incident on Freedom's Progress.
The Stop the Collectors mission is the main plot mission in Mass Effect 2, which mainly consists of answering requests from the Illusive Man that will lead Commander Shepard's team (which will grow along the way) throughout the Terminus Systems, in an effort to deal with the uncovered Collector threat, by any means possible.","See also: Mass Effect 2 Guide
The Stop the Collectors mission starts right after Shepard has found evidence that the Collectors are the force behind all of the recent abductions of entire human colonies in the Terminus Systems. It only ends when Shepard attempts to deal with their base, thought to exist on the other side of the Omega 4 Relay.
Assemble a team (1)[]
Using the Illusive Man's dossiers, assemble a team of experts to fight the Collectors.
After returning from a field investigation at Freedom's Progress with Miranda and Jacob, Shepard has a meeting with the Illusive Man. During the meeting, Shepard learns that the team's findings of evidence incriminating the Collectors as responsible for the mass abductions of human colonies confirms the Illusive Man's pre-existing suspicions. Then Shepard, despite any possible misgivings about working with Cerberus, agrees that Cerberus's effort to oppose this new threat upon the galaxy appears genuine and is worthy of Shepard's involvement.
The Illusive Man then tells Shepard that they should start by assembling a strong team for their now-common effort. He explains that most of the members of Shepard's former team have scattered throughout the galaxy and are either unavailable, unaccounted for, or likely unwilling to work with Cerberus.
The Illusive Man then presents Shepard with a list of possible recruits to consider, based upon Cerberus's intelligence: Dossier: Archangel, Dossier: The Convict, Dossier: The Professor, Dossier: The Warlord and, if you have access to their respective DLC or are playing Legendary Edition, Dossier: The Veteran and Dossier: The Master Thief. Shepard and the Illusive Man also discuss the question of involving the Citadel Council, which is left to Shepard's judgment. The Illusive Man then specifies that Miranda and Jacob will continue to serve under Shepard's command.
When ending the meeting, the Illusive Man pleasantly surprises Shepard by providing an initial crew member whom Shepard already knows very well: Joker. Joker then leads Shepard to a second big surprise: their ship, the new-and-improved Normandy SR-2. This part of the mission ends when you have recruited what is considered a sufficient core team by completing the first four (non-DLC) Dossier missions.
Go to Horizon[]
Go to the human colony of Horizon and stop the Collector attack.
This part starts right after you have recruited Jack, Garrus, Mordin, and collected the pod containing Grunt. Once triggered, you cannot do any other mission. An urgent message from the Illusive Man explains that Cerberus has received a warning of a possible new Collector attack on Horizon. He requests that you go there immediately, to attempt to stop the attack, but also, and more importantly, to gain a better understanding of the attacks and to research a way to oppose new ones.
Assemble a team (2)[]
Continue assembling a team with new dossiers from the Illusive Man.
This part of the main mission requires you to recruit additional squad members, and the following dossiers are added: Dossier: Tali, Dossier: The Assassin and Dossier: The Justicar. It ends when the Illusive Man decides to speak with you again in the Normandy's comm room to give the mission below.
Investigate Collector Ship[]
Board and investigate a derelict Collector vessel for valuable intel.
The Collector Ship mission unlocks at the fulfillment of a complicated set of triggers since Horizon. See here for specifics. Once triggered, you cannot begin any other mission until this one is complete.
You are sent to investigate a disabled Collector ship in order to determine how to use the Omega 4 Relay without being destroyed.
You leave after EDI hacks into the mainframe of the ship and discovers that Collectors use a Reaper IFF to get past the Omega 4 Relay.
Other missions and assignments can be resumed at this point.
Acquire Reaper IFF[]
Go to the brown dwarf Mnemosyne in the Thorne system to recover the Reaper IFF.
You travel to a dead Reaper to get its IFF transponder. When you arrive, you discover that it is not dead but mostly disabled, and as you fight your way to the core and the IFF, you get help from an unexpected source.
You obtain the IFF, kill the Reaper, and have the option to recruit a new addition to your party.
Await IFF Installation[]
You and your squadmates will always choose the worst time to take a kodiak joyride - just in time for Collectors to abduct your crew while you're away
After you have acquired the IFF, Commander Shepard has to wait until the installation has been completed. The time limit for Reaper IFF installation varies based on the number of available major missions remaining (i.e. recruitment or loyalty missions in the left tab of the Journal). You may need to complete as many as two or more missions or N7 assignments before the IFF will be ready. You will know when it's ready when you are in the CIC near the Galaxy Map and you hear EDI advise that you take the shuttle to your next mission.
Warning:  If you hear EDI's line about using the shuttle, accessing the Galaxy Map for a mission will trigger a countdown of sorts to the climax of the game's main storyline. You will no longer have the freedom to complete missions or combat assignments at your leisure without grave consequences to the crew of the Normandy (see next section).
Note:  If all previous major missions have been completed prior to the IFF mission, the IFF can be activated immediately after the IFF mission. In this situation, it is important to activate Legion PRIOR to accessing the Galaxy Map and talk to it one more time after the initial activation conversation. Otherwise, it is impossible to perform Legion's loyalty mission and also save the Normandy crew.
Also note: If you have any major missions undone including Legion's loyalty mission (though not including Stop the Collectors itself) and you don't hear EDI's line about taking the shuttle near the Galaxy Map, then you can still use the map and land on any hub world (Tuchanka, Illium, Omega, or the Citadel) and this will not trigger the countdown until you complete the remaining mission(s). The same applies to the Shadow Broker Base. If you have any last-minute upgrades or research to complete, do so before you access the Galaxy Map. Typically, you only get to play one mission or combat assignment before using the Galaxy Map triggers the ""countdown"" which is why Legion's mission is considered the one you want to save for last.
EDI informs Shepard that further tests need to be run on the Reaper IFF to confirm it is ready for use. At her recommendation, the Commander and the entire team fly off to their next mission in the shuttle, leaving the Normandy in Joker's care while the IFF installation is completed. Unfortunately, not only is the IFF harboring a highly advanced virus that cripples the ship, it is simultaneously broadcasting the vessel's position. On cue, the Collector cruiser drops in unannounced and the helpless Normandy is soon boarded. Out of options, EDI tells Joker that their only hope is to override her ""shackles"", giving her complete control of the ship.
Save the Ship[]
Joker to the rescue
For a few moments you will get to assume control of Joker as he frantically enacts a plan in tandem with EDI to purge the Collectors from the ship. Unfortunately he has to travel the length of the ship to do so.
As you take hold of Joker you will see floor lights throughout the ship guiding you to your destination. He doesn't have any weapons and can only hobble, so you have no choice but to ignore your crewmates while they're getting manhandled by the Collectors. Loitering near any Collector when they've finished with the crew will cause a cutscene and a game over. There are no save points at any point; you start again at the bridge if you screw up.
From the bridge the first destination is through ducts inside Mordin's Tech Lab. A Praetorian will come out from the elevator and turn its attention on Crewman Hadley and others so make use of the distraction. You will emerge in Deck 3 in the Life Support Control Room (Thane's quarters) and Crewman Hawthorne pledges to protect you. He gets thrown across the room shortly afterward and you will witness Kelly Chambers being forced into the elevator by a Scion. There is another Scion in the Crew Deck so there's no reason for you to linger; hurry up over to EDI's AI Core to release her locks.
Kelly Chambers' abductors
When that's done take the maintenance shaft to the engineering room on deck 4. Joker will emerge at the engineering subdeck and will have to take the stairs up. If you take the floor-lighted path to the starboard side (Joker's initial right), an ominous shadow fills the subdeck stairs and you have to wait for it to pass before proceeding. You only have one shot at this: the hostile will return and catch you on the next pass wherever you are. Tip: Don't follow the lights this time and go left for an immediately clear path. When you've activated the console next to Tali's usual spot, control over Joker is over and the subsequent cutscenes deal with EDI taking care of the problem.
In the immediate aftermath of the attack you learn that the entire crew of the Normandy except for Joker has been abducted. You are now at a major decision point: either head through the Omega 4 Relay immediately, or finish any remaining missions. If you choose to go immediately, i.e. without completing any more missions or assignments, saving the entire crew remains possible. If you do 1 to 3 missions or assignments, you will lose half the crew, including Kelly Chambers; if you do 4 or more, you will lose the ENTIRE crew except for Doctor Chakwas. Note that assignments that can be completed aboard ship or on a hub world like Omega don't count towards this.
Note:  If you are currently lacking anything that could be vital to minimizing casualties and making the upcoming ""suicide mission"" a little less, well, suicidal, the conversation with Joker, Jacob, Miranda, and EDI following the Collector raid will strongly hint you may not be quite ready yet. Talking to either Joker or Jacob and asking them for their opinions of the state of the team or the ship should also provide clear indications of your readiness.
Use Omega 4 Relay[]
Launch the suicide mission.
Use the Omega 4 relay to begin the final assault upon the Collector Base.
This is the point of no return. Before you use the relay, make sure the Normandy is upgraded to your tastes and your team members' loyalties are where you want them. If the ship's armor, weapons, and shields are not upgraded, or some of your team members are not loyal, parts of the crew might die during the Suicide Mission. This is also your last opportunity to retrain your powers in the Tech Lab, customize your armor, and retrain your squadmates' powers at the Shadow Broker Base if you have access to it.
On activating the relay, the Illusive Man briefs Shepard, now geared up for battle, and tells the Commander that he doesn't know what to expect on the other side. He ends by wishing Shepard luck in the coming fight. You are then treated to a long cutscene where your decisions on ship upgrades play out.

The Normandy Attacked[]
Bogeys pursue the Normandy through the debris field
The enormous wreckage field you emerge in testifies to the number of ships which have tried, unsuccessfully, to travel through the Omega 4 relay. Joker manages to maneuver the Normandy around the debris but EDI will warn that there are enemy vessels approaching. Joker takes evasive maneuvers as they open fire on the Normandy's upper hull. If you failed to upgrade the Normandy's armor, then a laser will penetrate the Normandy's hull and kill Jack.
A pursuing Oculus punches through into the Normandy's cargo hold. Shepard takes two squadmates down to deal with it. Tip: Take squadmates who can help you deal with a heavily armored target.
The battle with the Oculus occurs in two phases with a cutscene in between. In both phases, it will slowly advance and attempt to take a clear shot with its particle beam. Shooting from cover, keeping your squadmates in cover, and frequently changing position tend to be the best tactics, as the Oculus will constantly pursue you and will also try to flank you. Numerous fragile crates are in the area, and can be destroyed by the Oculus beam, so be mindful where you plan to dash into cover next. Also, be careful of the large number of explosive canisters around as they will not affect the Oculus but they can be deadly to you and your squadmates.
Cargo bay layout upon the Oculus' first arrival. Don't rely on the yellow boxes for cover, they break easily
From your starting position, there is a med-kit available to your immediate right. Two med-stations are at the far end. Two boxes of power cells can be found about the shuttle bay: one near the right med-station, and another at your near left (by the shielded floor beside gaping wall damage). As usual these will resupply ammo for all of your regular weapons as well as your heavy weapon, and they alternately respawn from time to time.
Tip: There will be multiple refills for both heavy weapon ammo and medi-gel in the upcoming Collector Base mission segments so there is no need to worry about conserving either during this fight.
In the first phase of the battle, you only need to lower the Oculus' armor to about 50% and it will retreat. During this first phase, the Oculus will ignore your squadmates and focus exclusively on Shepard, but you can safely remain behind the control console that you encounter as soon as you enter the shuttle bay: the Oculus will not move behind the console to flank you. Remain in cover while it is firing, then pop up and take it out.
About halfway through the battle a cutscene plays where Joker has to lose the remaining Oculus chasing the Normandy by sending the Normandy through a field of debris. If you didn't upgrade the Normandy's kinetic barriers, you will lose a squadmate here when the Normandy's drive core overloads. Eventually Joker emerges from the debris field with the remaining Oculus destroyed, save for one which re-enters the cargo hold. Joker comments that ""It's up to Shepard.""
The Oculus returns and continues the battle, with full armor, regardless of how much damage you inflicted before the cutscene.
A med-station and a box of power cells at the far end of the cargo bay. Another med-station is directly opposite the one here
In the second phase of the battle, you start at the opposite end of the shuttle bay from before, so you will need to find different cover. Also, even if you manage to return to your spot behind the control panel the Oculus will now fly right across it to flank you. There are several tall solid objects running lengthwise down the main area which you can use for cover, and you can dodge around them when the Oculus attempts to flank you, always interposing them between yourself and the Oculus. The Oculus will chase Shepard to begin with, but after being damaged and dodging out the holes in the side of the Normandy a time or two it will tend to start chasing your squadmates instead, making your job a lot easier.
Once the Oculus is destroyed Joker will call you back up to the cockpit when the Normandy is exiting the debris field.
The Collector Base comes into view and it launches an old friend—the Collector Cruiser—which turns to face the Normandy. If you upgraded the Normandy's weaponry, then the Normandy will easily destroy the Collector Cruiser at range. If not, the Normandy must engage it at point blank range with conventional weaponry and the ensuing dogfight will lead you to lose a squadmate.
Once the Collector Cruiser is destroyed, the resulting explosion overloads the Normandy's systems and sends the Normandy into a crash-landing on the exterior of the Collector Base. Shepard asks if the Collectors can detect them, and EDI replies that this is unlikely because of the lack of an internal security grid—the Collectors probably did not expect anyone to get this far.
It is time to infiltrate the base to stop the Collectors.
Defeat the Collectors[]
Destroy the Collectors once and for all.
The Normandy has crash-landed on the Collector Base's hull: now you have to go in and destroy it. This mission varies by who is in your party and if you gained their loyalty by doing their side missions. At the end of the mission you finally find out why the Collectors were abducting humans. Just as in the original Mass Effect, you will also be asked to make a very difficult choice that may have serious consequences.
After defeating the Collectors either Shepard or Joker talks with the Illusive Man one last time. This conversation varies based on your final decision (the Mass Effect 2 equivalent of the conversation following the Battle of the Citadel in the first game).
The final missions of Mass Effect 2 are clustered under this journal heading. See the navigation footer below for individual details per section."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Dossier:_Tali,"Prerequisite: Horizon (mission)
The Illusive Man provides Shepard with dossiers on three new squadmates after the mission to Horizon.
Tali'Zorah vas Neema

- Expert in combat tech, systems hacking
- Strong engineering background, familiar with Normandy

Formerly listed as Tali'Zorah nar Rayya, the quarian engineer earned her adult name after helping Shepard defeat Saren two years ago. Tali is currently on a classified assignment for the Migrant Fleet Admiralty Board on Haestrom, deep in geth-controlled space.","At least you won't have to worry about any pesky insects here
Tali and her team traveled to Haestrom, a former quarian colony world, to study the unusual things its sun is doing. Unfortunately the planet is under attack by the geth. Solar radiation on the surface is so strong that it will weaken and eventually overload Shepard's shields. You must stay in the shade and run from cover to cover to survive. Do not stay in the sun for any prolonged period of time because it will completely destroy your team's shields. Squad members will stand in the sunlight and take shield damage indefinitely, so it is sometimes required to maneuver Shepard or Order Move commands to put them in a safe spot. Simply put, AVOID THE SUN.
Note:  ""Shields"" here refer to kinetic barriers and biotic barriers; both forms will be stripped from yours and your squadmates all the same. Only Grunt is immune to solar radiation as he relies on armor for defense, even though it recharges like shields do. You can't be killed if you stand in the sunlight directly: your shields will deplete but no damage to health will occur. You will be alerted to the shield drain by a constant beeping sound as well as your shield bar reducing in the HUD.
Legendary Edition:  Player shields also throw off blue sparks when in sunlight as an additional visual cue.
Arrival[]
Casualties all around whenever these two factions meet
The first area after the drop-off has no combat, though your squadmates will make comments about the shield-stripping rays of Haestrom's sun. Move forward down the ramps to get past the sun and you will eventually reach a small gatehouse with a door on the right.
The building has two lootables: a Damaged Geth (+3,000 credits) and a med-kit with medi-gel. A quarian log next to a dead quarian plays automatically on repeat that gives you some brief background on what has happened. Activate the Gate Controls to open the facility gate outside. Leave the building and go through the gateway to continue the mission. Saving will be temporarily disabled once you open the gate as there will be a fight shortly.
When you go through the gateway, immediately get into cover and note two things: first where the sun falls and second where the enemies are in cover. A Geth Dropship arrives to deploy 4 Geth Troopers. Defeat all the enemies on the ground floor immediately in front of the gateway.
PROTIP: Fight in the shade
The area layout lends to two main paths of advancement: straight ahead, or higher ground via the ramp to the right from your starting position. Each route is guarded by an initial two Troopers, then reinforced as you proceed further. Both routes have terrible sight lines to the other, allowing you to focus on your enemies ahead instead of additionally watching your sides. In terms of sun protection the upper level offers more cover, but has less room for maneuvering. This is a large battlefield, so if you have a sniper rifle you can pick off enemies at a distance. Either route is possible with any weapons though.
A quarian died so he can give you a weapon upgrade
About halfway through the battlefield, look to the east. If you're on the upper level, you'll see a medical station next to a ramp that descends to a small chamber at the lower level. This area has a Heavy Pistol Damage upgrade next to a dead quarian. If you're on the lower level, a giant block shields a pathway east that leads to the same aforementioned chamber with the upgrade.
The geth reinforcements spawn from an orange doorway at the far side as you move forward. Each wave consists of 1-2 Troopers and a Geth Rocket Trooper. The door opens at least once. Rushing to the other side cancels reinforcements but then you will have to deal with enemies already present. Typically, you will have to fight 3 Rocket Troopers and a greater number of Troopers.
Geth do not infiltrate. They emerge from doorways connected to the void.
Combat Strategies: For shorter-range weapons it is a better to take the elevated causeway path as there is lots of cover to fight from compared to staying on the ground where longer range weapons are more suited for use. However, you will actually fight more enemies in the upper level than in the lower one.
Elevated Causeway / Up the Ramp: There are multiple waist-high crates you and your squadmates can lean out of once you reach the upper level. Aside from the initial two upper level Troopers, there is an additional Trooper charging in from the far side. The reinforcement door triggers earlier here, and you may end up having to scrap 11 or more Troopers. Trooper behavior here is to make a beeline to your location from the exit ramp on the far side while the Rocket Troopers hang back, and you'll face the latter only upon reaching line of sight around the ramp.
Lower Level / On the Floor: Keep in cover and your squadmates will tell you that the sun is too bright and another way must be found. You can continue or ignore them. The two initial lower level Troopers emerge from the halfway chamber almost immediately after you dealt with the dropship troops, so there's no avoiding them even if you took the other route. When you reach the halfway point, the reinforcement door only triggers for the first time. The two upper level Troopers have no pathing solutions to the lower level until this point, then they will descend from the exit ramp of the upper level. Another Trooper will spawn from the upper level, and typically descend from the midway ramp. You really have little protection here, the farthest area secured from the sun and gunfire is by the ramp before the halfway giant block, so you may have to rely on waiting for the geth to come into sight from this position.
Regroup[]
Once the geth are eliminated, loot the crate of Refined Iridium (+400 iridium) located across from the down ramp of the causeway. Remember the crane contraption you found it in and the resource's green coloring highly visible from afar, as there are many more like it on the next areas. There is one last straggler Trooper in the corridor east of the reinforcement door before you can save safely.
As you proceed through the corridor you hear some pulse rifle sounds. When you turn the corner you'll see two Troopers shooting at something. Eliminate them.
Mutual destruction seems to be a pattern
When the dust has settled you're left with a room of organic and synthetic dead bodies: two quarians and a geth phasing in and out of cloak. All of them are lootable: the Damaged Geth Hunter has 6,000 credits, the nearest quarian corpse has an M-9 Tempest, and the farthest quarian has a radio. Note:  The Geth Hunter cannot be looted while it's cloaked. Wait for it to become visible.
Warning:  Picking up the radio leads to a cutscene, railroading past a point of no return, and a fight, and the same thing happens if you ignore it and proceed directly to the next area. It is a good idea to save before this juncture.
The radio broadcasts a repeating message. Answering it introduces you to Kal'Reegar, the quarian in command of the marines assigned to escort Tali on her mission. A cutscene eventually plays with the quarian marines battling the geth and being killed by a strafing run from a Geth Dropship that also collapses a pillar and blocks Shepard's access to any quarian marines that may be still alive.
Getting the Charges[]
After the cutscene and dialogue options with Reegar that can earn some morality points, you must retrieve two demolition charges to destroy the pillar. But first, you and your squad drop down from the ledge rendering you unable to return to the previous area. In this next one, you'll initially come under attack from a couple of Troopers and a Geth Hunter, very much intact and stalking compared to the dead one earlier. You only have a small square block or some railings for cover in the immediate area, although you can take another option and try flanking the geth via a gap in the railings if they reach your position.
The quarians had offworld colonies when humans were barely beginning to harness electricity
When these first few robots are down, you can now direct your attention to the general layout of the battlefield. Right up north is the pillar you must destroy. West of it is a garage. Farther northwest leads to a bunker. EDI notifies you that the demolition charges are in these last two positions, and they come with heavy geth resistance before AND after you take the charges. There are two Refined Iridium stations in the area (+400 iridium each), one between the garage and the pillar, and one in the area before the bunker. Both locations also have two stashes of medi-gel each, and it's highly recommended you keep them in reserve instead of converting them to credits, as there's a significant possibility your squadmates may faint from too many gunshot wounds.
You can take the charges in whichever order, although it's recommended to go for the garage demo charge first because it is much nearer and easier, not to mention it has likely spawned some Trooper defenders on approach. The charges cannot be claimed while enemies are still active in the area, so trying any sneaky infiltration tactics to steal them won't work.
Note:  Both garage and bunker have proximity spawning triggers wherein if you trip a certain distance from these locations from any direction Troopers will spawn: 2 Troopers from the garage, 1-2 Troopers from the bunker. This is continuous: kill a wave, another replaces it as long as you're not within a certain distance from the bunker or garage. You can reduce the number of Geth Troopers you need to fight by simply going to the target location, though you will have to seek immediate cover against any hostiles already present. Once the defenders at a location are all down, Trooper spawning in the other area is temporarily suspended until after you've picked up the demo charge and fought your way out.
If you wish to go deploy heavy weapons, this section of the mission is an appropriate time as there are two ammo refill opportunities here and afterward.
Demo Charge 1 - Garage[]
Most of the cover going to the garage is in shade so don't worry about the sun.
Normally when you stick five beings in a garage they make music, not a murder squad
The garage is defended by at least 4 initial Troopers, plus a few more Troopers and a Hunter emerging from the ramp at the back of the room. To cut down on ""infinite"" Trooper spawn, you may have to take cover behind the crates below the garage doors as you eliminate the garage defenders.
Aside from the demo charge, the garage contains a med kit, a medical station above the ramps, a free thermal clip on the desk with the demo charge, and Tali's journal where she complains she can't get the data she needs because the quarians' equipment kept dying. She then recalls your stint with the mining laser on Therum and hopes she can get a core sample using demo charges.
It's recommended you save before taking the demo charge, because you'll face heavy resistance afterward.
As you exit the garage a Geth Dropship will fly in and drop off 2 Geth Troopers and a Geth Prime. Careful planning can make this battle much simpler to complete. Proper selection of cover is essential.
Ambush! The geth are deadly raindrops
Place your squadmates into cover before you trigger the Geth Dropship. You or your squadmates can be positioned in the area behind the ET3 vehicle at the back of the bay. With your two squadmates assigned positions in cover behind the yellow vehicle before the geth wave is activated, the whole wave can be picked off with no real danger. You can actually order a squadmate into the cockpit of the ET3, from whence they will be well-protected from enemies while still able to fire on them, or you can take advantage of it yourself.
Once you've triggered the dropship, it's best to have Shepard retreat rapidly to the back of the room and into cover near your squadmates behind the yellow vehicle.
Shepard can take cover on the wall directly in front of the med-kit with the ramps upwards right above you. The Geth Prime will walk up the ramp onto the landing trying to get to Shepard, point down its weapons at point blank range at Shepard, but be unable to fire on Shepard. The Combat Drones the Geth Prime spawns will be right above Shepard but unable to get you either. Your squadmates in cover behind the yellow vehicle can use weapons and powers to destroy the Geth Prime easily from their vantage point.
The remaining Geth Troopers tend to stay to cover out in the room but will tend to break cover and storm your position once the Geth Prime falls. Kill the remaining Geth Troopers quickly or they will overrun your position behind the yellow vehicle.
Using AI Hacking on the Geth Prime or on lesser geth to distract the Prime can be a helpful tactic here.
After the battle, save your game before continuing on to the second demo charge in the bunker.
Demo Charge 2 - Bunker[]
The second charge is hidden in a bunker you can reach by heading left (or north) as you leave the garage. The Geth Trooper ""infinite"" trickle will take place until you reach a point where multiple Troopers and a Geth Destroyer suddenly appear, which is around the ramp leading upstairs. It's also the farthest relatively secure location you can hunker down on without getting burned (the couple of debris just before the sunlight are also cover, but more vulnerable to flanking).
When the geth wave spawns you have a couple of options to kill the geth off:
Individually they're pushovers, en masse they're irritations
Option 1: Fight them on more or less even terrain. The ramp crates only have room for two people, and the large block in the middle has poor sight lines to the geth positions, so one of you three may have to use the debris cover below the ramp. The only danger here is the Destroyer which always bears down on its target's position to flush it out, so once that's dead dealing with the other Troopers is easy. They just strafe around rarely attempting flanking maneuvers.
Option 2: Use the high ground. The catwalk above is very exposed to the sun, although there are a few protected positions where you can pick off Troopers below. You can even use this in conjunction with Option 1, where you leave your teammates by the ramp crates while you do the shooting from above. Alternatively, the catwalk leads to a room east where you can open shutters so you can also flank and shoot at the geth below. Again, the only threat here is the Destroyer if it manages to reach your teammates, so dispose of it as soon as you see it, preferably before you go upstairs.
When the area has quieted down you can listen to another journal entry from Tali in the catwalk. Again she complains about fried equipment, and insists the star shouldn't be dying quickly as it was stable centuries ago.
No additional geth will spawn until you grab the second demo charge. The area has the following lootables: a medical station in the upstairs room connected to the catwalk, a free thermal clip in the same room, and in the bunker itself another medical station, power cells, a thermal clip, and the demolition charge. Saving before taking the demo charge is again recommended, and once more prepare for a fight. Note:  If you have enough heavy ammo for the moment, leave the power cells until after the upcoming battle as the power cells will also restock the ammo of all your other weapons. If need be, you can grab the power cells during the battle as well.
Geth initiate dialogue with phasic rounds and missiles
When you exit the bunker once again the geth will ambush you: an initial 2 Rocket Troopers in the catwalk, 2 Troopers and a Destroyer by the ramps. Reinforcements may periodically arrive from the door on the upper end of the catwalk, disgorging either Troopers or Rocket Troopers, though thankfully this isn't an infinite spawn situation. They really don't want you to get to Tali, or at least not before they can get to her. When the geth wave spawns you have a couple of options to kill the geth off:
Option 1: Keep fighting on the ground. Highly risky because of the combined Destroyer and Rocket threat. There is a big slab of rock outside the bunker you can hole up in, though if the going gets tough you can retreat to the bunker itself at the cost of reduced sightlines to the battlefield.
Option 2: Use the high ground. Dash to the door ahead to your left and proceed up the ramp to the room with the shutter controls. After spending some time on ground level one of your squadmates will suggest this option anyway. Opening the shutters (if you haven't already) will allow you to pick off the Rocket Troopers and then many of the enemies below. Some of the enemies below may remain in positions where it's difficult to snipe them from above but once you've simplified the battle by removing the troops from the catwalk you will find many effective ways to deal with them.
All that just to blow up something you probably could have climbed over...
Once the geth are eliminated move back to the pillar and plant the demo charges. You now have 10 seconds to get away before there is a rather large explosion. Even though your squadmates warn you to take cover and a rather ominous countdown appears on your screen, the detonation won't actually kill anyone, just knock your shields down.
Past the Pillar[]
Beyond the pillar is a door, then a small room with another door that loads the area beyond when you open it. Welcome to the quarians' base camp, where again you see nobody alive. Quarians and geth have killed each other to the last being, the only ""survivor"" being a badly damaged geth crawling towards you (reminiscent of the damaged LOKIs in the Prologue: Awakening mission, though this one doesn't explode). Put it out of its misery or not, it eventually runs out of steam anyway.
There are a lot of interactable things in the base camp. The room is a veritable treasure trove, if you can look past the abattoir. The door forward is locked, so might as well take your time. Your squadmates will have some comments on your surroundings. A few moments after your arrival, Tali appears on holo hailing her base camp. Call her back later when you're not busy.
All of them died so you can have their gear
Disassembled Geth Rifle (Assault Rifle Damage (Kinetic Pulsar)). Unfolds to a Geth Pulse Rifle when taken (cosmetic effect only)
Red Damaged Geth (3,000 credits)
White Damaged Geth (6,000 credits)
Ancient Wall Safe (bypass for 6,000 credits)
M-9 Tempest from the nearest dead quarian (if you didn't take it during the introduction to Reegar)
Weapons Locker for munitions refill and/or loadout reconfiguration
Tali's Journal (waxing nostalgic about the place and wishing Shepard is here to appreciate the sights)
Tali talks to Shepard over a comm channel
When you are ready, talk to Tali via the comm system to continue. She's surprised you're there, and isn't willing to talk about joining up with you just yet. Reegar's marines shepherded her to safety on an observatory beyond the locked door beside the comms. You can ask her about her mission, if anyone else is still alive with her, or if bringing down the Normandy SR-2 can help, though she doubts the latter because heavy firepower may collapse the fragile centuries-old buildings around you.
The chat concludes only one way: you asking her to unlock the base camp door. She complies and pleads with you to keep Reegar alive if possible. Morality points may be gained depending on your first two responses. This is a good point to save the game.
Getting to the Observatory[]
They're harmless, but the next ones aren't
Past the door, on the right there is a medical station with medi-gel. Continue down the ramp but be careful as you approach the doorway. There are 2 Geth Recon Drones waiting just beyond, though they shortly activate camouflage and disappear without attacking, eliciting a comment from one of your squadmates and heralding the arrival of more drones that do attack.
This next area is tricky because while the cover is shaded, it is easy for the geth to flank you. There's a lot of sun to your left (west), and the area has multiple pillars providing the shadows. There are 3 main paths to the other side, distinguished by the amount of sun protection. The westernmost is the least protected from both sun and gunfire; conversely, the easternmost is the most protected. Conventionally you'll be fighting it out in the center and eastern paths.
Piece of cake going south to north, right? Sure is, without any endlessly spawning flying irritants
The Recon Drones continuously spawn in groups approaching from a distance until you reach the other side of the area. As you move forward, the Geth Recon Drone spawn points move further back in the room but the ""faucet"" doesn't shut off completely until you've reached the other side and killed any other geth in the area.
Also, as you move into the area you will encounter two Geth Primes: one hovering near the midway point of the area, and a second one closer to the far side. The first Prime tends to stay behind a large piece of cover patrolling back and forth. The second Geth Prime shows up after you move forward towards the door at the other side of the map. For whatever reason the Primes in this area don't try to advance aggressively on your position as Primes usually try to do—but hedge your bets all the same.
Combat Strategy: It's a good idea to ""leapfrog"" forward, ordering your squadmates to take specific cover locations before moving up yourself, and so on. The Recon Drones come in distinct waves with breaks in between, so clearing them out quickly gives you more time to deal with the Prime(s). Long range powers and weapons tend to work best for this since you don't have to move up into dangerous territory and risk getting caught in the open by more drones when they show up. Rank 4 Area Overload is excellent for destroying the drone swarms; Adepts can use Singularity to create a floating ""flytrap"" that will destroy any drones that enter it. Unfortunately, AI Hacking is not effective here, as it won't stop the drones from attacking you or cause them to turn on each other; the most it will do is distract a nearby Prime briefly. It is generally safe to advance between waves of drones, because any new wave will stop in front of your position rather than moving past or flanking you.
Tip: Remember that powers such as Overload don't actually need be close enough to ""lock on"" to an enemy to hit them, they have near infinite range so merely aim the crosshair on target and the power should hit home.
Where's a Jenkins when you need one
Prime #2: The second Prime can be prevented from spawning if you advance close to where the first Prime is before destroying it. This can be a risky strategy but saves on time and fighting. Engineers can accomplish this relatively safely through aggressive use of their Combat Drone, which can often befuddle the Geth Prime into retreating. Getting the drone close enough to the exit door can also prevent additional enemy spawns. Infiltrators might be able to sneak through the area with Tactical Cloak. Another strategy is to wear the first Prime down to the point where it's almost dead, wait for a gap in the drone waves, and quickly advance to its location and kill it only once you get there. The Vanguard can accomplish this easily with a Charge.
You know when you are at the end when you see a vehicle pointing towards a door. There is nothing to pick up in this area once the geth are killed.
Warning:  Once you've killed all the geth in the alley, be aware that if you go backtrack to pick up ammo or for any other reason, another wave of Geth Recon Drones may spawn unexpectedly even though the battle is ""officially"" over. It is OK to get ammo at this point, just expect the Geth Recon Drones to come in and take them down as you move forward towards the door at the other side of the room.
Go through the door and save your game before you continue on.
PROTIP: kill the Colossus from this vantage point if playing on low difficulty settings
You arrive at a small sealed room. Nothing in there but an initially locked door, a Security Console, and an Ancient Wall Safe (+6,000 credits) you can bypass. To continue the mission, you have to lift the security lockdown by accessing the Security Console. Once you've done so, the door behind you permanently seals shut. A cutscene plays where the room's shutters open, showing the vast amount of geth blocking your way to Tali's position. The first thing you will notice is the Geth Colossus trying to break through. This Colossus also has a unique self-repair ability, so some additional tactics will be needed to deal with it.
Note:  On easier difficulties the Colossus may be killed at this point without leaving the room with the help of heavy weapons if the shots are well placed. This effectively skips the geth waves should you decide to fight it close, as well as a scripted dialogue below, and this method is not recommended.
Note:  If you have a sniper rifle, it can be put to decent use picking off geth from the windows in the room before you exit. Don't shoot at the Colossus yet, it will just repair itself. Shepard can kill geth from the windows in cover while watching out for the bolts the Geth Colossus shoots at Shepard. This will simplify your life at the beginning of the upcoming battle.
Vanguard Exploit: After opening the shutters, a Vanguard can move to the left window's corner and Charge to the Colossus, which will be interrupted by Kal'Reegar telling Shepard to stop, triggering his dialogue. After conversing with him, the Colossus will be glitched and will no longer fire upon Shepard. It is possible to charge to the Colossus again, where you may attack it freely for a while before geth troops begin spawning from two exits of the wall behind the Colossus. You may also call your squadmates to your position by the Colossus, though they may not survive as you attempt to take it down. Other geth may also be glitched by Charging from the window, usually those near Kal'Reegar.
Warning: The siege pulse fired from the Colossus' head homes in on whatever it's aiming at (usually you). The only way to avoid getting hit is to get in cover or to juke the shot by strafing and changing directions at the right time, which is easier at long range. The Colossus will continuously fire the pulse whether it can see you or not (even if you are cloaked as an Infiltrator), so listen for the ""whistle"" of the shot as it travels and wait for it to strike cover if your sight is blocked to know when it's safe to move.
Past The Shutters[]
If only you had infinite rockets like Kal'Reegar the fight would be done in seconds
Go out the door and down the stairs. Right next to a med-kit and some thermal clips, you encounter Kal'Reegar, the last surviving quarian marine accompanying Tali. You can't ignore him; attempting to get past him will initiate a dialogue anyway. He informs Shepard that the Geth Colossus as well as a large number of other geth forces are blocking the way to Tali. You can ask him about the tactical situation and what the best strategy is for approaching the Colossus, so it's a good idea to take the time to talk to him thoroughly if playing this level for the first time.
Continuing the conversation with Kal'Reegar, you ask him to either provide cover fire with his missile launcher or tell him to stay down. If you tell him to stand down because he is injured, he will argue that he can still fight and his job is to protect Tali. If you die during the ensuing fight, the autosave loads this moment so you can adjust or uphold your decision promptly.
The Colossus takes potshots but can do nothing against waist-high barriers during your talk with Reegar
Persuading Reegar to stand down requires a Paragon interrupt and rewards a good amount of Paragon points. Immediately agreeing to let him stay in the fight grants Renegade points. If he is convinced to stand down, Shepard can later change their mind and ask for his help after all, though no additional morality points are awarded. If Reegar stays in the fight, he will take potshots at the Geth Colossus with his missile launcher every so often dealing a small amount of damage.
Warning:  On all difficulty settings, allowing Reegar to fight gives you only a limited amount of time to get close to the Colossus and engage it (close enough to disable its repair protocol). If you take too long to do this, Reegar will eventually comment nervously that he has drawn the Colossus' attention and die soon after (possibly drawing a reaction from your squad). If he survives, Kal'Reegar can appear later in both this game and the next, so think carefully if you want him to fight as you can't get him to stand down once he starts firing.
Note:  There is a bonus to not having Kal'Reegar fight for you. After the conversation is over, if you chose to have him stand down, talk to him again, and again say ""stand down"". By doing this conversation your squadmates will automatically be revived if they were killed. You can repeat this process as many times as you want as long as you choose the ""Stand Down"" answer when talking to him.
Get to Tali[]
The 3 possible routes of advancement
Before proceeding in any direction, take a moment to clean out the geth approaching your position. This will make life safer whichever strategy you are going to try.
If you listened to Reegar's battlefield layout assessment, you have three routes of approach: left, right, and center, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. All routes have infinite spawning geth (Troopers and Destroyers but more of the former), forcing you to be highly mobile. Killing the Colossus is the only way to stop the reinforcements from coming, and you can only do it conventionally near it due to its repair protocol.
Reegar DID warn you, don't blame him for this
To the Left: The left path is well-covered from the Geth Colossus but is more vulnerable to the continually spawning individual troopers. This path can be better if you or your squad lacks long-range weaponry. Keep picking off the geth that spawn, and eventually you will reach a covered area, which is to the left of the Geth Colossus. From here, you can shoot at the Colossus from behind cover, but be careful of the ordinary Geth Troopers and especially Destroyers who might flank you. Position your squadmates such that they can take out the regular geth while you start to chip away at the Geth Colossus.
Combat Tip: You may ultimately find it safer to pursue the path to the right because the high ground makes it much harder for enemies to approach and gives you clear vision of any that do.
The Sniper's perch on the right side of the engagement
To the Right: The right path has a sniper’s post and a lot of cover. However, it is mostly exposed to the sun, so take that into account. Clean off any geth you can see up there before heading up the ramp. Crouching along the guard rail on the left will protect you from the sun, and there is a very safe position behind a wall on the right at the very beginning of the catwalk. This path is good for combat-heavy squads and squads with assault rifles and sniper rifles.
There will be a few Troopers and a Destroyer that will spawn when you arrive at the halfway point, so keep on shooting them until you can reach the overlook above the Colossus. Be particularly ready for Destroyers and duck behind one of the boxes on the left where the guard rail will protect you from the sun. Don't be afraid to retreat at this point as you don't want to be caught between a flamethower and the Colossus.
Once you reach the overlook, your team can hide and shoot the Geth Colossus to death with their regular guns at their leisure, just watch your back as another wave of geth can appear. In the correct position Geth Colossus shots will be blocked by a pillar, and spawning geth cannot approach directly.
On higher difficulties, good luck on a frontal charge
Up the Middle: The middle path is only good if you stay in cover; otherwise it is suicide. Well really it's mostly just suicide, but it can be done on lower difficulty levels. You have plenty of cover from the ordinary geth, but the Colossus has a firing solution on you the whole time. The harder the level, the more suicidal this path is.
The most secure spot for taking out the Colossus - just don't stick out your head at the wrong moment
No matter what path you choose, keep in shaded cover and avoid the Geth Colossus main cannon fire at all costs; while being hit won't instantly kill you at full health and shields as it would in the original Mass Effect, it will stagger you briefly which can be fatal if you're already under fire or damaged. As Reegar already told you if you talked to him, either path has its pros and cons; the key is to advance slowly and patiently. It's a good idea to set up ""kill zones"" with your squad in good vantage points, then move forward until a wave of geth is triggered, then retreat, letting the enemies advance for you to pick them off, then move your squad up incrementally, repeating this until there is enough of a lull for you to get good damage done on the Colossus. If a geth wave threatens to overwhelm you, don't hesitate to keep your squad healthy with a medi-gel or bust out a heavy weapon such as the Arc Projector or the Avalanche to quickly disable or destroy several of them at once; there will be ample refills for heavy weapon ammo following the fight. If you want to use heavy weapons against the Colossus instead, the best option for this is the Cain, though a single shot is not enough to kill it outright on higher difficulties.
The Colossus is protected with heavy shielding and armor. Once damage is done to its armor and Shepard is still too far away, it will collapse into a defensive position, enter into a repair mode to rapidly regenerate its shields, and on Hardcore/Insanity, armor. The only way to prevent this is to fight your way in close, which permanently disables the repair protocol from activating again. A good way to know you've gotten close enough is if you hear loud mechanical chattering from the Colossus. To accomplish this means you need to thin out the other geth in the area first to make sure that isn't suicidal. Once you get close enough to the Colossus that your squadmates can start shooting it, they can actually take it out by themselves while you cover them from any other geth, as the Colossus tends to attack you exclusively (though it can and will attack your allies at close range if it can't see you). Be careful as at close range the Colossus will also fire a rapid-fire cannon in addition to the siege pulse from its head.
Note:  The Colossus always ignores other geth under the effects of AI Hacking.
After you destroy the Colossus, be sure to take down any remaining geth that you may have missed. Tali notifies she'll unlock the door when you eliminate all stragglers.
Without any enemies it's now safe for looting. There are two medi-gels in the area. The first is a med-kit next to Kal'Reegar. The second is a med-kit located in the sniper's nest on the right side of the battlefield. There are four crates of Refined Iridium (+200 iridium each, +800 iridium total) to collect located on the four crane objects around the battlefield. There are also two power cells: One is to the right of the observatory door, and the second is on the wall opposite from the left of the observatory door.
The geth didn't trap Tali behind the door; they're trapped in there with her.
Proceed through the observatory door when you're finished. In the observatory, you will find three disabled geth platforms next to Tali. You can salvage a Damaged Geth (+9,000 credits). On Hardcore or Insanity difficulty levels, you can find an Intact Pulse Rifle that awards a Geth Pulse Rifle on another one of the platforms.
Once you encounter Tali in person, you can ask her what she and the marines were doing there, and about what she has been up to for the last two years. You then ask Tali to join you. If Kal'Reegar survives, he will take the data and upload it. If he is dead, then Tali is disappointed that she is the only survivor of her whole team and she uploads the data herself over a secure channel. If you brought Legion with you, Tali becomes hostile and tries to shoot it while shouting a warning about enemy geth. A Paragon interrupt is available, otherwise Legion will simply take cover until Tali ceases fire. While she doesn't entirely buy Shepard's justification for allying with a geth, she agrees to save the discussion for later. Shepard, the squad, and Tali then return to the Normandy."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel:_The_Council,"Prerequisite: Freedom's Progress (mission)
You automatically get the mission upon completion of the Freedom's Progress mission and access to the new Normandy.","When you take command of the new Normandy, there will be a message from Shepard's former commanding officer, David Anderson.
If Shepard saved the Council, the message is:
On the off chance that the rumors are true and you actually are alive, I need you to come and talk to me on the Citadel. A lot has changed in the last two years. You put us/me on the Council, and it's only fair that you be allowed to speak for yourself about what we've been hearing.
If Shepard did not save the Council, the message is:
On the off chance that the rumors are true and you actually are alive, I need you to come and talk to me on the Citadel. A lot has changed in the last two years. You put us/humanity on top, and it's only fair that you be allowed to speak for yourself about what we've been hearing.
Go to the Citadel. Use a Rapid Transit terminal to travel to the Presidium. You will be met at the human embassy by Anderson.
Udina and Anderson listen to Shepard's input
If you saved the Council in Mass Effect, there is a Council meeting underway. If you didn't, the new Council refuses to meet with Shepard. The Council is skeptical about your mission to stop the Collectors from wiping out human colonies. They do not believe that the Reaper threat is real.
If you saved the Council or if the Council died and Anderson became a Councilor, you can choose to be reinstated as a Spectre. There is no choice if the Council died and Udina became a Councilor. In all cases, Udina shows up late and he will be upset at how Anderson has arranged things without telling him first."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Dossier:_The_Justicar,"Prerequisite: Horizon (mission)
After the mission on Horizon, the Illusive Man provides a second batch of team-building dossiers. This is one of them.
Justicar Samara

- Biotics strength near that of an asari matriarch
- Extensive weapons training

Samara is a justicar, a rare member of an asari monastic group trained in enhanced combat biotics alongside standard weapons. Samara was recently sighted on Illium, outside normal asari space.","On your first visit to Illium, an asari concierge named Careena, accompanied by two LOKI Mechs, greets Shepard upon arrival. She informs you that Liara T'Soni has paid for the Normandy's docking and administrative fees and that Liara would like to speak with Shepard. After the chat with Careena EDI advises Shepard that Liara may have information on Samara's location.
Liara can be found in the admin office overlooking the trading floor. Go there and speak to her. As this is a reunion with your former squadmate you may have to discuss a few matters first before you can proceed to the business of progressing this mission. Those other matters can be tabled for later. As an information broker Liara can point you to the relevant people for recruiting Thane Krios or Samara, so ask about the latter.
Speak with Officer Dara at the transport hub to set you on Samara's trail
Liara tells Shepard that Samara arrived recently and registered with Tracking Officer Dara. Officer Dara can be found at the transportation hub, at the bottom part of the map. The officer tells Shepard that Samara is at the commercial spaceport. You can hail a cab to the spaceport by either a dialogue option with Officer Dara or by walking to a console at the center of the hub. Should you inquire further, Officer Dara tells Shepard that justicars are like Spectres, but no government oversees them. Justicars are only bound by their code.
Going to the spaceport is a one-way trip; once at the spaceport, you cannot return to the rest of Nos Astra without first completing the mission. You will be given a chance to reselect your squadmates and/or weapons on hailing a cab.
Spaceport[]
Detective Anaya denies Pitne For clearance to leave
Once at the spaceport, there is a cutscene in which Detective Anaya is talking to the volus merchant Pitne For, discussing the recent murder of Pitne For's business partner, Dakni Kur. A justicar is also investigating the murder.
When you regain control you can talk to several people in the area: Pitne For, a turian worker, and an asari spaceport official. To the north is an area ""sealed"" by holotape (you can pass through it), but two guards are there blocking the way. Nope, you can't squeeze through them or shoot your way out of this, speak with Anaya inside the police station for permission to go through.
Shepard learns from Anaya that Samara is at the crime scene. Anaya is anxious to have Samara leave as soon as possible. Her superiors have ordered her to detain Samara, but doing so would probably result in the detective's death. You can advise Anaya that she has the right to refuse such a suicidal and stupid order. If you do, both squad members will make snarky comments about Shepard's own tendency to send them on deadly missions.
So where are the equivalent of asari donuts and coffee mugs
Eventually you'll ask for directions. Anaya obliges and gives Shepard permission to enter the crime scene, but warns that Eclipse mercenaries are probably involved in the murder and control the back alleys. There is a Weapons Locker in the police station in case anyone needs to change weapons and a medical station with medi-gel.
Crime Scene[]
The two aforementioned police guards have moved to the sides after your chat with Anaya and warn you about the dangers ahead. Soon after you cross the police tape, there is a console on the right with shipping details that will start the assignment Illium: The Justicar: Stolen Goods Found. After the second police tape you automatically draw weapons, though there are no hostiles yet. At the end of the corridor there are two stairs, one going up and one going down. Down the stairs is some salvageable Circuit Boards (+3000 credits).
Looks like the color scheme of the hour is blue and yellow, with some white
Shepard overhears Eclipse mercenaries deploying a squad to hunt down the justicar when moving to the upwards staircase. Up the stairs and around the corner are an Eclipse Vanguard, three LOKI Mechs, and a Sisterhood Initiate. The enemies are fairly close together and unaware of your presence at first, so take advantage of this to hit them with some good area-of-effect powers to soften up their defenses quickly. There is plenty of cover but be careful of being hit by the Vanguard's biotics as this will stagger you and expose you to additional fire.
Overall Combat Strategy: There is no need to make the battles in this mission harder than they need to be. Place your squadmates into cover well behind Shepard on staircases, in hallways, or in prior rooms to the section you are trying to complete. You can then move forward carefully, peeking around corners and doorways while using weapons and powers to gradually wear enemies down, retreating if you come under heavy pressure. Vanguards and LOKI mechs will both attempt to close with you but there is enough space in most areas to allow you to give ground while chipping away at them until they fall. The biggest danger is being hit by biotics or rockets which can stun you with potentially fatal results depending on how much other incoming fire there is.
Samara demands answers from an Eclipse Lieutenant
At the other end of the corridor with the first fight is a door sealed with more police tape. Open the door to start a cutscene. An asari Eclipse mercenary is seen flying through the air, splatting right next to the door you came in. The last one standing is the leader and sole survivor of a band of mercs that had been fighting the justicar Samara. Samara is interrogating this Eclipse Lieutenant about the name of a ship that recently departed carrying someone Samara is hunting. The Eclipse Lieutenant refuses to answer, so Samara defenestrates her with biotics. She biotically flies down to the Lieutenant and asks again, but is again rebuffed. Samara then breaks the hapless mercenary's neck.
Sensing Shepard's approach, Samara turns and introduces herself while politely asking to know the Commander's intentions. Shepard asks Samara to join in the mission against the Collectors. Samara respectfully declines because her own mission tracking a dangerous fugitive comes first. Detective Anaya arrives, telling Samara she wishes the justicar would join Shepard as otherwise Anaya will be forced to detain her on the orders of Anaya's superiors. Samara says the Justicar Code allows her to submit to detention for only one day, after which she must continue her investigation, implying that she will fight her way out of custody and kill anyone in her path, including Anaya. Shepard offers to find the name of the ship carrying Samara's target, which would allow Samara to leave Illium and join your mission, thus satisfying the Justicar Code and avoiding any violence. Samara suggests questioning Pitne For for more information.
Up to 8 Paragon points or 2 Renegade points may be earned in this entire conversation. Ending the conversation returns Shepard to the spaceport. You can't go back to the crime scene as the two guards will resume blocking the way in.
Spaceport, Part 2[]
Samara and Anaya reach a temporary truce
You must question Pitne For to get a lead on how to obtain the ship name Samara needs. He can now be found by the pile of boxes closer to the crime scene barrier. If you had already talked to Pitne before entering the crime scene, there is a dialogue option to accuse him of lying to you. Either way, an optional but easily missed Renegade interrupt can be used for 5 Renegade points. Pitne For reveals that he was smuggling an illegal biotics-enhancing chemical named Minagen X3 and selling it to Eclipse. However, Minagen X3 can also cause death, which is why Eclipse now wants him dead.
The volus gives Shepard a pass card allowing access to the Eclipse base. The pass card is used on the elevator next to the police station; taking it advances to the next stage of the mission. Before taking the elevator, you can talk to Samara and Anaya inside the police station or use the weapons locker inside. Samara is not in a cell or restrained in any way; talking to Anaya will reveal why.
Eclipse Hideout[]
An autosave is generated when the next level is loaded. For the next three floors you'll be navigating around a single docking bay. You'll be ascending some stairs, seeing the same docked freighter, and encountering enemies, with some variations in topography. The enemy composition is generally Eclipse Vanguards, Sisterhood Initiates, and LOKIs in varying numbers. You can't snipe enemies in different levels though, because they only spawn when you're in the same level.
They enter the battlefield in waves
On the first floor, immediately outside the elevator when you arrive will be a single undeployed LOKI Mech. Take it out while it's still unpacking itself. Past the door is an Eclipse Vanguard and two LOKI Mechs, who soon will be reinforced by two more Eclipse Vanguards and a Sisterhood Initiate, then three more Initiates. The first Vanguard immediately deploys a warp field to bust open a Minagen X3 canister, and if your Shepard is exposed EDI comms in to confirm its toxic characteristics.
Take cover on the right side of the doorway once you've opened it and take out the mercs before proceeding into the room. The LOKI Mechs tend to remain in their starting location and won't close the distance to your location. Be very careful about advancing into this area nonetheless, as additional enemies will enter from the far door and you don't want to be caught away from cover or flanked at the wrong moment.
Be careful about strolling through this gas
Warning:  From this point onward are toxic canisters containing Minagen X3. If destroyed, the toxic canisters will emit a red cloud that sometimes is opaque enough to obscure your line of sight to enemies. The cloud does not dissipate (except for the one that came out of the crate destroyed by the first Vanguard) but can become more translucent. Saving then loading will remove the clouds and restore destroyed canisters. EDI tells Shepard that the toxic cloud will enhance biotic abilities but concentrated amounts are harmful. Being in the vicinity of the cloud will trigger a toxicity level meter. At full toxicity, Shepard will start taking damage to shields and eventually to health. Depending on how biotics are evolved, the Minagen X3 exposure either increases the damage or range of effect of Shepard's biotics. Squadmates and enemies are not harmed by the clouds and can remain inside them indefinitely.
The next room has a weapons locker and the M-27 Scimitar Assault Shotgun. This may be a good opportunity to switch heavy weapons to something good at taking out a heavily armored, mobile target such as the Missile Launcher or the Particle Beam.
Elnora taking her chances against Shepard's squad
When you pass the door before the stairs you'll hear someone cowering for their life on the other side. If you open the door you'll meet Elnora, a recently initiated Eclipse mercenary. Using the Renegade interrupt will kill Elnora and garner 5 Renegade points. Alternately, you can question Elnora and learn about the Ardat-Yakshi, after which you let Elnora go and then gain 5 Paragon points. If you skip past Elnora's room to come back later (once you find the evidence against her), she will be gone, depriving you of any Renegade or Paragon points. In the same room as Elnora are power cells and you can Download Results from Sample 634 Analysis for a Biotic Damage (Hyper-Amp) upgrade. As you open the door upstairs to the next floor an autosave is generated.
On the second floor you'll encounter more Eclipse Vanguards, Sisterhood Initiates, LOKI Mechs, and toxic canisters. Initially there are 3 Initiates, 2 LOKIs, and 1 Vanguard, though they will soon be joined by 0-1 Vanguard and and/or 1-3 Initiates from the room opposite your entrance when some of them die. Use cover and weapons to destroy the mechs and mercenaries and try to conserve ammo. The Vanguards are dangerous in close quarters with their shotguns. There is also a medical station with medi-gel and a hackable Eclipse Terminal (+3000 credits).
Minagen apparently doesn't affect enemies or their biotics
On the third floor is the usual assortment of enemies, now supplemented with an Eclipse Heavy. Fortunately there's an explosive canister near her initial position, and potentially the other mercs may clump near her as well. The others are 3 LOKIs, an Initiate, and a Vanguard. Two of the LOKIs are in inaccessible locations at the far side, so you'll have to take them out at range though any thermal clips they may drop will also be inaccessible. They aren't reinforced by any troops this time. There will be another medical station with medi-gel and another Eclipse Terminal (+6000 credits).
Past more stairs and a door that also functions as an autosave point is a docking bay with more Eclipse. Nearest from your entrance are two Vanguards and a Heavy. The first Vanguard will appear suddenly and you'll need to grab cover. There's a Minagen and explosive canister combo near her, make it go boom. In the alcove on the left from your entrance is the second Vanguard's initial position, along with a crate of refined platinum (+2000 platinum). The Heavy may retreat to the back after taking a shot. At the far distance you may see an A-61 Mantis Gunship. Approaching it will cause it to fly away, and so does shooting at it.
It's only a maze if you think it's a maze
Past the spot with the Vanguards, the docking bay widens out. The aforementioned Heavy may retreat to the stairs there, partnering up with a LOKI. The usual Eclipse enemies will enter the battlefield from your destination across the room; Initiates, Heavies, and Vanguards. The raised platform/bridge where the first Heavy and LOKI were is a sniper's cover position from the incoming reinforcements, you can clearly see their movements there except when obscured by the central support columns. You can whittle them down from there but you won't be able to see their health/barrier bars at that distance, unless you're wielding a sniper rifle. For shorter-range weapons you may have to advance while seeking cover on the provided crates if you're not willing to wait for the enemy to come to you.
In the office following the docking bay is another power cells and another medical station with medi-gel. If you didn't collect the M-27 Scimitar Assault Shotgun before, this is the second location one is available for pick-up. There is a Data File you can listen to with audio from Elnora in which she admits to killing the volus, which can be later given to Detective Anaya. Your squadmates make a point of chiming in to remind you of it.
Walking thermal clip reserves (and a power cell box for later)
The exit door is another autosave point. After a short corridor and corner turn your team emerges at another docking bay with a trio of LOKI Mechs and power cells directly ahead. Once the mechs are down, the way forward is a hackable door on the far side of the area reachable only by crossing a bridge. However, the gunship from earlier will return to do battle with Shepard when you are halfway across the bridge. The door is also inaccessible unless you defeat the gunship, and your squadmates will remind you of the pressing priority if you examine the door. So don't cross until you're ready to take the gunship on.
This gunship behaves more or less like other gunships, alternating between volleys of rockets and its mass accelerator cannon, both of which should be avoided. It flies back and forth around the area, occasionally flying away from the docking bay, then returning to hover in the air close to the ground. While hovering, it will periodically drop several FENRIS Mechs at a time which will try to attack you while you focus on the gunship.
Combat Tips:
By now you shouldn't be surprised Shepard has a knack for taking on much larger enemies and winning
Retreating back to where you came from immediately upon the appearance of the gunship is the safest course of action as it's the only location with adequate cover. Move far enough back into the room and it will put you out of reach of the gunship's weapons entirely. From this position the only real threats are the the FENRIS mechs the gunship will drop. You can move out to use weapons and powers at the gunship and return to the safety of the entrance to quickly deal with the FENRIS Mechs when they arrive. It's advisable to position your squadmates in cover well out of view of the gunship so they can focus on the mechs and not get overwhelmed.
Unless you have critical need, leave the power cells where they are for now, since grabbing them during or after the fight with the gunship will restock the ammo of all your other weapons.
The many fragile crates in the docking area can interfere with targeting powers, so consider destroying a few of them prior to triggering the gunship.
The hackable door to leave the area could theoretically be used to skip the fight with the gunship entirely; however, in practice there's no way to hack the door fast enough to avoid getting interrupted by the gunship's attacks.
The M-920 Cain can take out the gunship in a single shot or at least heavily damage it, but you can be exposed to the gunship's fire while charging it up and getting hit by rockets will interrupt charging (as will dying). A well placed M-920 Cain shot can take it down by aiming high and to the left of the open space where the gunshup can first be targeted, or shoot it from cover when it comes to a hovering stop.
After the battle with the gunship, grab the power cells if you hadn't already done so, then cross the bridge. There are several thermal clips scattered around the docking area, as well as a med-kit with medi-gel to the right of the hackable door. Bypass the door to continue after you've picked up everything you need.
Inside the room will be a Shipping Manifest that confirms that Pitne For was smuggling Minagen X3 and red sand for the Eclipse, which initiates the Illium: The Justicar: Smuggling Evidence assignment. There is also an Eclipse Terminal (+6000 credits).
An ill wind shall blow upon all who ignore biotic gods
Accessing the door to the next room triggers the final pre-combat autosave for the mission. At the end of the corridor there is an addled volus named Niftu Cal, who is a captured employee of Pitne For. The Eclipse apparently injected many drugs into him. He is amusingly delusional and believes he is a biotic god. You can encourage him to attack the local Eclipse commander in the next room for Renegade points or, using a Paragon interrupt, knock him out for Paragon points. Ignoring him entirely leads to no further consequences.
Moving forward into the corridor, there will be a weapons locker, a medical station with medi-gel, and the third and final chance to pick up the M-27 Scimitar if you still have not picked it up.
Save your game before proceeding through the final door to the last battle.
Captain Wasea[]
Captain Wasea, angry at having her coffee break interrupted
The next area is a boss fight. If you enabled Niftu Cal's delusion you'll see him waddle in and attack first, ineffectively. Captain Wasea then responds with a military-grade biotic smackdown that sends him flying away into irrelevance before engaging your team. She briefly complains about her problems before biotically hurling a Minagen container at your location, starting the fight.
Captain Wasea's office is full of waist-high barriers and toxic containers, conducive to any playstyle from aggressive to cover-hugging, long-range or close-range (be extremely wary of Wasea's M-300 Claymore up close, however, as that packs a punch). Four central columns can impede your sight lines to the opposite end of the room, but only marginally. Wasea often attempts to throw those Minagen containers at your position, so to mitigate the threat destroy them where they are before she could use them against you. If your Shepard's biotic, take advantage of the Minagen cloud power boost while keeping an eye on your toxicity levels and remaining cover positions should they be compromised by the gas. Note:  Unlike prior Minagen containers, some of them do dissipate after destruction over the course of the battle.
Wasea goes to battle with three Eclipse flunkies, a Heavy and two Initiates, and when any of them fall down reinforcements arrive via two doors to the left and right of her desk. There are also some free thermal clips lying around, note their positions if you run low on gun cooling.
It's a cool second boss fight area and all, but mechanically speaking there's no benefit to stretching out the fight as you don't gain experience per kill
If Wasea's still alive after a certain period of time, she biotically lifts the heavy cargo containers behind her desk and retreats to the room behind it, along with her goons. The second room's layout has a clear center area and no columns to impede vision compared to the first room, also full of waist-high cover positions, and it's also full of Minagen containers that Wasea will hurl at you. She can only throw those as far as her desk, so you should be safe if you're still in the first room nowhere near. Reinforcements arrive from a single door at the far end of the room, to the right. Note:  If Captain Wasea is killed quickly, the heavy containers won't get moved, and the area will remain closed to you. There are no credits or other items available in that area (aside from free thermal clips) so there is nothing important to be missed if you skip exploring this area.
Combat Strategy: The best strategy is to focus on taking down Captain Wasea as fast as possible rather than killing the weaker mercs first, as the reinforcements are unlimited as long as Wasea's standing. Hitting Wasea immediately with Stasis (if you have it) will stun her long enough for you to unload a lot of damage and possibly take her out right away. Heavy weapons such as the M-622 Avalanche or Arc Projector can be effective at neutralizing the other mercs in the area. The Avalanche is particularly effective as it will freeze but not kill the other mercs, preventing new enemies from spawning while you deal with Wasea. Alternatively, firing the M-920 Cain at Captain Wasea the moment the battle starts will instantly obliterate her and any other mercs present, but be careful as getting hit by biotics or rockets will interrupt charging the shot.
After the battle is over one of your squadmates helpfully indicates there must be some record you can consult, since Wasea isn't in any position to speak. Her desk has the datapad she was holding in the pre-fight cutscene, access it. Afterward you can either return to the spaceport or look around for loot. If you opt to remain you can exit the room and return to the spaceport via the door you initially arrived in.
Aside from thermal clips, the only lootable in the office is a nearby hackable Eclipse Terminal (+3000 credits).
Spaceport, Part 3[]
Returning to the spaceport creates the final autosave for the mission.
Pitne For is standing outside the police station. If you talk to him, he will ask if you found a shipping manifest. You can give it to him to finish the Smuggling Evidence assignment for 9,000 credits and 5 Renegade points, or hold on to it. If you saved Niftu Cal earlier in the mission, then he will be present as well and you can talk with him.
Two law enforcement agents lounge about while you do the hard work
Go inside the police station and tell Samara that the person she is hunting for left on the AML Demeter. Samara's impressed and then agrees to join you. She swears service to Shepard for the length of the mission, overriding whatever the Code may dictate, flaring up her biotics while kneeling in affirmation. You can be respectful of Samara's oath for Paragon points or slyly ask if she will do anything Shepard orders for Renegade points and a not-so-veiled threat.
After the oathtaking Samara asks if you should return to the ship. You can do so and end the mission immediately, claim you still have business with Detective Anaya to immediately speak with her afterward, or decline and look around in general. If you want to speak with Anaya, you will always open with information about the recent murder of a volus if you obtained Elnora's audio statement, or otherwise Anaya just thanks you for getting Samara off her district. How you respond to her colors her opinion of you for the rest of your short time in the level. If you tell her that Elnora killed the volus, doing so nets no experience, credits, or morality points. The detective claims the evidence is inadmissible, but Samara will vouch for Shepard, forcing Anaya to concur with the justicar.
If you still have the datapad copy related to Pitne For's smuggling activities, it can be given to Anaya for 4,200 credits and 5 Paragon points, which also finishes the assignment.
Talk to either Anaya or Samara to leave the area and return to the Normandy. You will be unable to return to the spaceport afterwards."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Dossier:_The_Veteran,"Prerequisite: Zaeed - The Price of Revenge
Prerequisite: Freedom's Progress (mission)
This mission is acquired automatically after adventuring through Freedom's Progress, provided you have the relevant DLC installed. In Mass Effect Legendary Edition it is included in the base game as with most of the trilogy's DLCs.
Zaeed Massani

- Expert in both personal and small unit combat
- Unparalleled mercenary soldier and bounty hunter
- Known for a willingness to get the job done, no matter the cost

Zaeed Massani is, without a doubt, the most feared mercenary and bounty hunter in the galaxy. His services have been retained by Cerberus at extremely high cost. He is currently awaiting pickup on Omega.","Similar to Kasumi Goto's recruitment mission, this is a simple and effortless way to increase the number of your henchmen early. After some conversation you will gain Zaeed as a squad member regardless of your responses.
Like any upstanding citizen Zaeed does his part keeping the streets of Omega clean of vermin
Upon docking on Omega, there is a yellow-armored guy standing in the alley a few meters from you, near the door that opens up to the plaza outside of Afterlife Club. That's Zaeed, who is brutalizing a batarian prisoner. Simply approaching them triggers a conversation, and there are morality points available at certain junctures. He has an unresolved mission the Illusive Man neglected to put on your dossier: Vido Santiago, the head of the Blue Suns, captured an Eldfell-Ashland Energy facility on Zorya. EAE hired Zaeed to deal with it, and Zaeed in turn would like your assistance on the matter.
At the end of the conversation, the prisoner tries to escape, though Zaeed shoots him in the leg. He will excuse himself to turn in this bounty, though he is already available as a squadmate and can be selected via squad member request.
Zaeed will be in the previously inaccessible Starboard Cargo Hold on the Engineering Deck of the Normandy SR-2, though like with Kasumi, talking with him only triggers ambient comments and doesn't follow the full conversation progressions of the other squadmates. The mission Zaeed: The Price of Revenge, along with the Faia system of the Ismar Frontier cluster (and the Aquila system as well, if Firewalker Pack is not installed) will be unlocked after the completion of this mission.
The following information is drawn from cut content and is not to be considered canon in any way."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Zaeed:_The_Price_of_Revenge,"Prerequisite: Dossier: The Veteran
The mission will be unlocked upon acquiring Zaeed into your party. You need to travel to the planet Zorya (Faia System, Ismar Frontier) to start the mission. Unlike the rest of the loyalty missions, this one and Kasumi's do not require you to do the mission on Horizon first.","Arrival On Zorya[]
The shuttle lands on Zorya
Zorya itself is a pleasant enough place. When the shuttle drops off Shepard and the squad, they all turn to see a smokestack in the distance. Zaeed then taps into the Blue Suns communications and warns about ambushes. Keep heading down the path as you will not encounter any enemies for some time. When you progress a little bit, it becomes apparent your landing didn’t go unnoticed and now you have enemies heading to your location. Eventually you will come across some dead bodies and Zaeed will say that their deaths were definitely Vido’s work.
Another radio communication down a little ways will say for the Suns to take positions because you are apparently not a runaway. After that when you round a corner to the right, get into cover because now you are approaching the southern entrance and you finally run into the Blue Suns.
The exterior of the refinery
Staying behind the cover near the entrance to the clearing keeps the enemies from flanking you, and you can get a good line of sight on them. Once you can’t engage the enemies from the entrance, move to the right avoiding the potential of getting flanked if you go left, and to a massive tree root which will provide some excellent cover. Just be careful because there is a Heavy in the mix with a Missile Launcher on the elevated platform.
When all the initial enemies fall, move up and find some more cover as there will be more reinforcements coming in. They include a Blue Suns Pyro, a FENRIS Mech, Blue Suns Troopers, and a Blue Suns Heavy. Note that the final Heavy is the tougher helmetless variant that possesses Tech Armor, which she can use to fully replenish her shields once they get depleted. Once they are all down, you will hear a fall back order on the radio. Check the area for a PDA (6,000 credits) and a med kit. Grab them then move up and access the nearby bridge controls to continue.
Zaeed’s Story[]
Zaeed listens in on Blue Suns communications
When you access the controls, Santiago comes over the radio and tells the Suns that he will kill anyone who retreats while you are still alive. Zaeed and Santiago apparently started the Blue Suns about 20 years ago. If you select the “twenty years?” dialogue option, you will hear the story about how Santiago betrayed Zaeed, paid six men to hold him down, and then shot him in the head. Once you have all the information you need, move on. Santiago will come over the radio, your position is compromised and he orders all squads to amass at the southern entrance to the facility.
Move up the path and on your left, overlooking some waterfalls is a crate containing some refined palladium (+400). Once you have it move to the gatehouse, where two more squads have just been sent.
Southern Gatehouse[]
Explosions send mercenaries flying
Open the door to start a cutscene where Vido and some of his mercs are on an upper platform. Vido eventually goads Zaeed into firing as he goes for cover. His rounds hit a metal pipe near Vido, prompting Vido to ask if he is going nearsighted. It turns out that the pipe was full of explosive gas; the pipe explodes, injuring Vido and killing some of his men. Zaeed then breaks a valve setting off a chain reaction that starts to destroy the whole refinery. Choose your response to Zaeed's actions—which can include a Paragon interrupt to sock him for his recklessness—then proceed into the burning facility.
There will be two Troopers advancing on the squad; take them down (there is a small easy-to-miss cover location on the right side of the room if you need it), and before leaving the area, find a crate of refined palladium (+400) near where Zaeed bashed the pipe. Head across the catwalks to the next area, but keep an eye to the right for some more refined palladium (+400). Once you access the door a cutscene will play giving you two options with significant moral implications.
Choose Your Path: You have to decide whether to save the facility workers and the facility itself, or go after Vido regardless of collateral damage. Do not look for a Charm or Intimidate option—at this point, neither exists. Note that if the option to save the workers is taken, the player will need sufficient Paragon points to Charm Zaeed in order to secure his loyalty at the mission's climax; this can be done easily after recruiting him, as long as you have concentrated on accumulating mainly Paragon points up to that point. The mission always concludes in the same location, but how you get there varies depending on your choice. There will also be two unique upgrade rewards depending on your choice: a Heavy Weapon Ammo upgrade with the Paragon path, and an Assault Rifle Damage Upgrade along the Renegade route. Also, the Paragon path rewards more credits (see below for details). Make your choice.
Paragon: Saving The Facility[]
A worker pleads for the Commander's help
If you choose to save the facility then Shepard intimidates Zaeed, who agrees to help despite his rage at your refusal to aid in his revenge. Shepard jumps down onto a lower platform and the worker looks relieved, or as best as you can tell from a distance. Move down the platform and head to a door which you have to bypass to enter. Once inside head up the stairs and open the next door.
This room is on fire, literally. Move around and find the three fuel control stations to redirect the fuel. The first is right next to the first set of stairs in the room. The second is found once you walk over the large pipe on the left, easy to miss. There is a generator pipe after the second one in the corner, salvage it for 6,000 credits. The third is next to a catwalk. Some workers behind a glass wall tell you that the extinguishing system is upstairs and that the doors won’t open until the fires are out. When you get to the upper level, an explosion will drop a flaming pipe on the floor in front of you, so head to the right and go across the catwalk to get around this obstacle. When you reach the other side, grab the refined palladium (+400) in the corner across from where the catwalk comes down, and go into the room. Grab the Heavy Weapon Ammo upgrade, then access the fire control systems to extinguish the fires. Head out the other door and down the catwalks.
Renegade: Going After Vido[]
The refinery proves to be a dangerous place to fight
If you chose to go after Vido, then you will proceed through the door while an explosion is heard behind you. You enter another room with a door; open it and take cover on the other side. There are three Blue Suns Troopers in this area. Use any methods to take them out, then move up. Another Trooper is coming down a ramp bridge, but before he can get across, an explosion sends him and the bridge down into the depths of the refinery. Turn right and head up to cover because more enemies will come out, two Troopers and a Pyro. Once they fall, head in the door they came out of to access a servos for 6,000 credits and a terminal for assault rifle damage.
The next area, which was across the now destroyed bridge, holds three more Troopers and a Pyro that just loves to get in your face. Take them down before they can and move up, but only a little. More Troopers will come out, five of them to be exact, and a heavy on an upper platform to the left. Take these ones down fast, especially the heavy. Once they fall, head into the door.
Moving in on Vido[]
The next room contains another refined palladium (+400) crate on the left on top of a pipe. In the second room is the M-451 Firestorm and the adjacent room contains two Blue Suns Troopers. Make sure they don’t interfere with your mission further. Once they are down, grab the credits from the datapad (Paragon only), and before you take the power cells if you want to switch Heavy Weapons, do so first at the Weapons Locker. Then take the power cells and move into the next room.
The next room is the largest in the refinery and the hardest fight.
Refinery Core[]
Overhead canisters of flammable material make this area dangerous
Vido’s radio transmission when you enter this room will differ a little bit depending on which path you chose. It is much longer if you went Paragon and mentions Shepard as well.
This room is the largest in the facility and contains a lot of cover but a lot of enemies as well. Move to cover, best to put both squad members on the left and cover the right from the cover just down the stairs from the entrance. Just watch for Suns that flank on the right, because they can kill you quickly if not dealt with before they get behind the tanks. Doing this means you don’t have to watch your squadmates as much, but still keep an eye on them. In general, kill quickly. If the above strategy falls apart, it is best to focus all the squad on the same enemy and thin their numbers fast. On Hardcore and Insanity settings, you can very quickly get overwhelmed, as the enemies will most likely either catch you in a crossfire, or force you into the path of the flaming tanks.
Blue Suns Troopers and Pyros come out from two side rooms just ahead of you and will rush you and the squad. Take them out before they have a chance to. Eventually the two large tanks at either end of the far side of the room will start spraying fire and moving. Shoot them and try to bring them down on top of attacking Blue Suns.
It is imperative to shoot down the tanks once they start spraying flame. The flames can hurt you, flush you from cover, and inflict panic on you similar to how enemies panic, which you obviously don't want. Once a tank catches fire, destroy it quickly by shooting it down to explode below, causing damage to any nearby units (which can include your squad). The YMIR Mech in the back doesn't activate until the last Blue Suns merc dies (or if shot, or if you get too close), so once you hear its footsteps it's usually safe to engage it.
If Shepard, a squad member, or a Combat Drone have reached the line of the first pair of doors at a point when more enemies are due to spawn, they will spawn from the second pair of doors instead. In this case, the enemies can include Blue Suns Heavies in addition to the usual troopers and pyros. Thus if you wish to avoid encountering Heavies, avoid moving too far into the room until enemies stop spawning.
When the Blue Suns stop coming, a YMIR Mech begins to advance on you and the squad. Take it down fast. The ML-77 Missile Launcher works well here, as you can fire and move back into cover quickly, and the rockets should find their target. The YMIR here likes to focus on Shepard more than your squadmates, so use that for an advantage and take it down. Once it is down, move up (there are no more enemies) and grab the Medi-gel and any needed clips. Then head into the two doors that the Blue Suns came out of as there will be some salvage in there, each worth 6,000 credits. You can ignore the other two doors because they contain nothing, no matter which path you chose. Once you are done head to the large door at the opposite end of the room, which leads to the landing pad.
It is possible (though understandably difficult) to bypass the battle by running for the door at the back of the room. Since the way is usually barred by the YMIR mech, this isn't always feasible, but remains a possibility if the mech is lured away from the door. Vanguards can Charge at the YMIR Mech before the bridge extends, allowing them to run straight for the door. This can be done even before the YMIR activates, with the possibility of leaving the area without killing any enemies.
Combat Strategy: There is an alternate way to make this entire fight much more manageable by simply staying outside where the Power Cells and Weapons Locker are. Put your squadmates into cover on either side of the door and edge carefully into the room until you hear or see enemies approaching. As long as you don't go too far into the room the door won't shut behind you and you can retreat and take the fight from a much safer place where enemies won't pursue you. On the higher difficulty levels this strategy works wonders, as you can whittle the enemies down with powers and careful shots without exposing yourself to much fire. This works best if Shepard is a class with powers that can arc over cover like Incinerate as many of the opponents are reluctant to leave cover, but any class can eventually beat this fight from outside the room with enough patience. Having Kasumi can definitely help here, as her Shadow Strike ability can be used to do huge damage to the Blue Sun troops as long as you can get a good lock on them, and she safely returns back to her cover spot behind the door after each strike. Additionally, her Overload can help thin out enemy shields. You can save the Power Cells for when you get low on ammo, or access the Weapons Locker to refill. You can leave Zaeed with his sniping abilities with some line of sight at the enemies that will be coming at you, but move him back to safety if he starts to take too much damage.
Warning:  If you choose to fight the final battle without leaving the room with the Weapons Locker, be aware that summoning a Combat Drone past the door can cause trigger this door to shut and lock, preventing you from finishing the mission unless you reload a prior save or use cheats or console commands to get through the door.
Refinery Landing Pad[]
Paragon Route[]
Zaeed angrily tries to shoot down Vido's Gunship with his rifle
Vido limps onto a gunship and curses Zaeed over the radio. Zaeed will fire whatever assault rifle he has at the gunship until it overheats. He does kill the guard next to Vido and Vido seems to be shocked. Zaeed then ejects the heat sink and turns on Shepard with his gun pointed, saying that Shepard cost him 20 years of his life. However, the overheated heat sink ignites some fuel which then explodes, collapsing a metal beam that pins Zaeed beneath it. Choose your responses to the next dialogue options.
Eventually you arrive at a dialogue tree with a Charm option. If you cannot use the persuade option then you save Zaeed but do not gain his loyalty.
If you use the persuasion option then Shepard will put a pistol to Zaeed’s head (only to turn the grip toward him), reminding him that the mission always comes first and scolding him for letting his grudge with Vido get the better of him. Zaeed will get the point and agree to put Vido behind him until the mission is over. The squad then boards the shuttle to head back to the Normandy. Zaeed looks out the shuttle window then at Shepard. The shuttle then takes off and heads back.
Additionally, if you do this mission after the suicide mission, choose the Paragon path, and have at least two more squadmembers left, then there will be an option to leave Zaeed to die when a metal beam collapses on him.
Renegade Route[]
Zaeed walks away from Vido's burning corpse, his thirst for revenge satisfied
Vido is caught limping towards the shuttle, when Zaeed fires a shot and gets his attention. Vido will turn and respond, but then Zaeed fires a round, but doesn't kill him. Zaeed ejects a thermal clip from his pistol into a pool of fuel that Vido is lying in. As the fuel ignites and burns Vido alive, Zaeed turns and walks away. See below for your rewards.
Mass Effect 3 Consequences[]
If Zaeed survives this mission and the suicide mission, he will return during Citadel: Volus Ambassador. If his loyalty was not secured during this mission, he will be killed by mercenaries present. If his loyalty was secured, he will survive and it will be possible to persuade Din Korlack to give both the location of the colony and the volus Bombing Fleet war asset. In addition, Zaeed himself can become a war asset.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Jacob:_The_Gift_of_Greatness,"Prerequisite: Horizon (mission)
After the mission on Horizon, Kelly Chambers will inform Shepard that Jacob wants to talk to Shepard. When Talking to Jacob, he informs Shepard that last week his father's ship sent out a distress call, reporting a crash and requesting a rescue. However, the ship went missing ten years ago, so he has his doubts about his father being alive, but he would still like to investigate to get some closure. Someone passed a message about the distress call to Jacob's personal log through Cerberus filters.","Arrival on Aeia[]
Talking with the VI leaves you with more questions than it answers
The shuttle drops Shepard and the squad a little south of the hulk of the MSV Hugo Gernsback. Jacob comments that the ship is mostly intact and that the crew could have survived the impact, but wonders where they are now. When you approach the ship there will be the distress beacon VI on the right of the bridge into the ship, to the left is an officer’s log that will give you some information regarding the crash and what happened before the activation of the beacon. Go in the ship to find a few more logs that reveal a troubling picture of the crew experiencing loss of higher cognitive functions and the officers exploiting that. Inside the ship is also a datapad that has 3000 credits.
Head out of the ship and across from the bridge are some spare parts that can be salvaged for 1500 credits. You can recover these either before or after you talk to the beacon (attempting to pass by activates it automatically). Talking with the beacon will give some interesting information. Apparently, Captain Fairchild was killed in the crash or shortly before it, and Jacob’s father was promoted to Acting Captain. The beacon will also describe how it was set up about a year after the crash but wasn’t activated until a few weeks ago, after a hiatus of almost nine years. The beacon also reports that ingesting the local flora impairs mental functioning.
Move on and eventually you will come across a female survivor babbling about how the leader said someone from the sky would save them. You can earn a few morality points based on your response. While she is talking, you see someone sneaking up you. A Paragon interrupt will allow you to save her life. Use the crates and pipes around for cover and take out the ""hunters"" that are ambushing you.
Ambushed by a motley crew; eliminate the shotgun-wielders with extreme prejudice
Combat Strategy: On the higher difficulties this is one of the hardest fights to survive in the entire game especially if you underestimate the danger. You are immediately facing large numbers of hunters sending a hail of constant fire your way, plus several more will enter the fray from a distance to replace those you kill. To make matters worse, a couple of the hunters armed with shotguns will try to flank you from either side of the long piece of cover you start near. If you see a hunter sneaking up on either side, disable his shields, knock him down, and dispatch him pronto. Saving Jacob's Pull or having another disabling ability ready is important for this situation. Your squadmates unfortunately like to run forward and often get shot down immediately (and repeat this when revived); manually ordering them to hold position behind cover ASAP can help keep them alive. Right at the start of the fight you can quickly back up to hide behind the engine parts behind you and to the right, which can be a safer place than where you started. You can also send a squadmate to take cover here while you take a forward position if you're more able to handle the incoming fire.
Additional Tips:
Having Energy Drain as a bonus power can pay dividends as it will not only strip enemy defenses but also help keep your shields up against the withering enemy barrage. If Tali is in the squad her Energy Drain (if unlocked and upgraded) can likewise make her surprisingly good at surviving this fight compared to other squadmates.
If Kasumi is with you, her Flashbang Grenade can be a useful tool for suppressing enemy fire while you pop out to attack a priority target.
Heavy weapons can be absolutely worth using in this fight to help kill or disable a few of the attacking horde and give you some room to breathe. The best weapon for this is generally the M-622 Avalanche; the Arc Projector can work but has a brief charge-up period before each shot that can make you a sitting duck against the sheer volume of fire coming at you. The Avalanche has the added advantage of knocking enemies out of the fight without killing them, meaning that additional enemies will not spawn to replace them.
Be careful about the female survivor; regardless of whether you saved her, her body will be behind you at the start of this fight and getting stuck on it while you're taking fire can be a very unexpected (and frustrating) way to die.
There are salvageable parts worth 1,500 credits on the left near where the hunters appeared. Move along and after a little while you will come across a stripped mech, Jacob will say that the hunters must be putting on a lot of pressure. Up the road, so to speak, is a settlement.
Female Encampment[]
Women in the encampment. They seem... tense about something.
Upon arriving you encounter some of the members of the encampment and after they get a good look at Jacob, they are terrified. You can comment on that and then Jacob offers up some explanation on why the men and women are separated. Move around the camp and examine the food stores, to your immediate right. Jacob will say they are completely spoiled and that the women must have been eating the native plant life. Medi-gel is to the left of the food, grab it.
Warning:  Be alert and ready to take cover as you explore the seemingly peaceful camp, because as you move further back some LOKI Mechs will emerge suddenly saying that the leader demands obedience and to relinquish all weapons. Take out the LOKI Mechs and continue exploring. In the center of the camp on a crate is a datapad, and to the right of the camp is some spare parts, get both and bank 2,100 and 1,500 credits, respectively.
The ship's doctor stands nearby. From a datapad she gives you, you learn the following:
The crew were split into officers and crew, and the officers hoarded all the food, forcing the survivors to eat the local toxic food.
Five officers survived the crash, but all were then killed within a week of each other once the beacon was complete.
Within a year all the male crew-members were either dead or exiled.
All the women were assigned to officers like property.
Bypass the nearby disabled mech's safeties to blow up a barricade and progress. Once you hack the mech, get back because it will explode.
Get to Ronald Taylor[]
LOKIs learn how to fly thanks to Jacob
Move over to the dead bodies and one of the squad members will observe that the older corpses appear to be posed, as in a warning, and the rest just lay where they fell. Then Ronald Taylor comes over a PA system, saying that his crew mutinied and that he only just now got free. Jacob refuses to believe anything his father is saying. Ronald also mentions that his security system has gone haywire and they will attack anything. Now you have to fight groups of LOKI Mechs on the way to wherever Ronald is hiding.
Move up to the crates and get into cover, as there will be some mechs at the top of the hill. Once the initial mechs are down you can move your squadmates into cover at the center of the clearing using rocks to the right and the crates around the transmitter thing as cover - try to deal with this batch quickly before more mechs from the right side get into range. Find cover for Shepard anywhere you can and still get a clear shot. Take out all the mechs and then move your squadmates up because there will be more mechs coming from the crates at the back and from the right, which is the path forward.
Combat Strategy: Throughout the next section, as you advance through multiple waves of LOKI mechs, two main strategies suggest themselves. The first and safest is to take out all the mechs in each group before advancing and triggering the next group. The second is to use AI Hacking to hack one or more of the mechs and advance, using them as your vanguard against the next wave. This second tactic is riskier as you need to maintain a hacked mech at all times to keep drawing enemy fire; if you are relying on a squadmate to maintain the hacking and they go down for any reason you could find yourself in trouble in a hurry. On higher difficulties LOKI mechs deal a huge amount of damage so despite their slow speed you shouldn't take them lightly.
Once you take down the mechs from the forward crates move your squadmates to positions that give them a clear shot at the advancing enemies. About 10 LOKI Mechs will be coming from that direction, so make sure that all the effort that went into maintaining them all these years goes to waste. Once all the LOKI Mechs are down explore near where the large crates are for some spare parts worth 1,500 credits and a heavy pistol upgrade.
How are you supposed to train guards if they easily forget everything thanks to the food?
Move along and up the path. When you have sight of another encampment, squeeze all three members of your squad behind some crates, as there is no other cover nearby. Ronald will come over the PA saying that he took years to train his guards and they will defend him until they die. Jacob will respond with some choice words. Once you take out some additional attacking mechs, move up to the canopy where you will find three items: medi-gel, some spare parts worth 1,500 credits, and some power cells; you can save the medi-gel and power cells as a refill for the final battle or grab them immediately. Then save your game before moving on.
Ronald Taylor’s Headquarters[]
The large wall ahead in this next area will provide some initial protection. In this compound you must contend with the trained human guards Ronald Taylor mentioned earlier, as well as some final LOKI mechs. You will also have to contend with a YMIR Mech. The YMIR will move around and flank you if you stay behind the wall, so fall back out of the area if you need to, as it will not move beyond the compound. Use this to your advantage by leaving your squadmates in cover well back behind the entrance to the compound and draw the YMIR out by killing 1-2 of the weaker enemies. Again, the YMIR will not chase you past the wall where the medi-gel was located. Simply hide behind the wall where you first entered the area with the medpack and power cells and take the YMIR out at your leisure. Once the YMIR is down the fight should be fairly straightforward. Move back into the clearing if you need to and move your squadmates into cover where they can assist you in taking out the remaining human guards. Be careful about using fragile crates for cover as they will not hold for long under fire. Once all the enemies are down, move around the clearing to get some element zero and a datapad for 2,400 credits. Once you are ready open the last door and head up to where Ronald Taylor is playing king of the castle.
Jacob and Ronald share a tender father-and-son moment
Ronald’s mood when you arrive is overjoyed. He doesn’t seem to recognize Jacob and apparently thinks that you are there to rescue him from his “insane” crew. You ignore Ronald initially, allowing Jacob to angrily question his father without revealing their familial ties, an honor that falls to you. A shocked Ronald immediately retracts some of his lies, admitting that he wasn’t ready for the burden of command and that it changed him. Jacob retorts that nothing could justify treating people like ""things"" to fulfill a sick fantasy of living like a king with a personal harem for ten years. Ronald says he can't determine where things ""went wrong"" but he knows something did; he further admits that even after the beacon was repaired, revealing what had happened to the outside world wasn't an attractive prospect. Jacob argues that the Gernsback's food supply could have only lasted for so long, though Ronald points out that it could have lasted quite awhile with only his own mouth to feed.
You must then decide Ronald Taylor's fate: take him to be arrested by Alliance officials, abandon him to certain death at the hands of other vengeful survivors, or tell Jacob that you'd shoot him, causing Jacob to leave his father a half-charged pistol with which to commit suicide. Choosing to maroon Jacob's father results in a brief exchange involving Shepard's other squadmate who will respond coldly to Taylor's protests at being left behind. It also awards an equal number of Paragon and Renegade morality points.
After you make your choice, you return to the Normandy."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Illium:_Liara:_The_Observer,"Prerequisite: Illium: Liara: System Hacking
This assignment is available upon the completion of the above. Speak to Liara for the assignment to commence.","Note: If the Lair Of The Shadow Broker conversation option is selected after starting this mission, then this mission instantly completes without awarding credits or experience. Therefore, complete this mission before beginning the Shadow Broker DLC.
From left to right, locations of terminals 1 to 5 (two are visible on the last)
Liara will tell you about a senior agent of the Shadow Broker known only as the Observer, who she wishes to identify and kill in order to severely weaken the Broker. In an effort to do this, she asks the Commander to find and hack 5 terminals, each containing a fragment of text with which to unmask the Observer. Liara's assistant, Nyxeris, has narrowed down the list of potential suspects to a turian, a salarian, a krogan, a batarian and a vorcha.
After successfully hacking a terminal, you will be given the option to call Liara and tell her who you believe the Observer is. Liara assembles a strike team to take the suspect out. Alternatively, you can continue to search for evidence.
Locations[]
Data Point 1[]
Next to the asari and volus discussing human colonies and business on the western side of the Trading Floor. The text reads:
“…trader tried to kill the batarian. Claims it was because he hates slavers, but the men were more likely fighting over money. Watch for now…”
Data Point 2[]
Found near the counter in the Eternity bar. The text reads:
“Smuggler and assassin have refused to work with the vorcha due to lack of trust. Odd to see scruples from the men at this point.”
Data Point 3[]
On the Trading Floor. At a digital information board, just right of the large hologram. The text reads:
“The turian's asking too many questions. Observer recommends terminating him and framing assassin or salarian contact.”
Data Point 4[]
At a kiosk near Serrice Technology. The text reads:
“Turian contact working well with the trader. Observer has rescinded kill order against him, given difficulty in securing contact with the trader through other methods.”
Data Point 5[]
Located just down the stairs from Liara's office. The text reads:
“Vorcha trader has requested no further contact with the salarian. Salarian is becoming more trouble than he is worth. Observer recommends a kill, but she may have a grudge.”
Guessing the Observer[]
Good thing she's on your side
After hacking the fifth terminal, you can call Liara, and a new dialogue option becomes available: ""None of the suspects fit"" based on the following logic:
Vorcha - clue 5 identifies him as a trader and therefore clue 1 identifies him as male.
Salarian - clue 5 identifies him as male.
Turian - clue 3 identifies him as male.
Batarian - clue 1 identifies him as male.
Krogan - clue 2 identifies the assassin as male. By process of elimination, the krogan is almost certainly the assassin since the vorcha is a trader, the salarian has a potential kill order on him, the turian had a kill order on him rescinded, and the batarian is a slaver.
Observer - clue 5 identifies her as female.
Selecting the option of ""None of the suspects fit""  leads to Shepard informing Liara that the Observer is female, whereas all of the possible suspects are male. Liara then deduces that her assistant, Nyxeris, has been feeding her misinformation, and is a double agent working for the Shadow Broker. If you wrongly identify one of the five as the Observer, you earn 2 Paragon points. If you correctly deduce that the Observer is not one of the five, you get 5 Paragon points, and Liara beckons Nyxeris to her office to deal with the spy herself. Return to Liara to conclude the assignment.
The rest of the morality points in this assignment are earned during your closing talk with Liara in her office. If you picked the wrong person, Liara will tell Shepard that the other agents have gone to ground and she will continue her search. If not, Liara informs you Nyxeris had some interesting data on her and was well-compensated to boot, so she gives you the spy's credits. In either situation, you can tell Liara, ""Don't give in to temptation"" for 2 Paragon points or ""Good luck, Liara"" for 2 Renegade points. Warning:  Choosing the ""Liara's needs"" investigate option inexplicably ends the conversation and doesn't let you say ""Good luck, Liara"" or ""Don't give into temptation.""
Investigating her anger about the Shadow Broker leads to Liara mentioning that the Broker wanted to sell Shepard's body to the Collectors. To fully explore the conversation, you should choose ""Anger at Shadow Broker"" before investigating ""Liara's needs."""
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Samara:_The_Ardat-Yakshi,"Prerequisite: Dossier: The Justicar
After several personal conversations with Samara, Kelly Chambers will relay that Samara wishes to speak to Commander Shepard.","Samara tells Shepard that the person she has been hunting for the past 400 years is on Omega. She reveals that her target is her own daughter, Morinth. Morinth is an Ardat-Yakshi, an asari with a rare genetic disorder that causes her mates to die during sex.
Once on Omega, EDI informs Shepard that she is unable to discern any pattern in the deaths on Omega that would point to an Ardat-Yakshi. She advises seeking out Aria T'Loak who could possibly have information. Aria says the Ardat-Yakshi's last victim, a young human woman named Nef, stayed in the apartments nearby. Samara interjects a bit if you brought her with you for this chat, but if not, she will appear at Nef's apartment, saying she's done some investigating.
Nef's room and her active journal
The apartments are close to the entrance to the quarantine zone for the Dossier: The Professor mission. You find Nef's mother, Diana, grieving there. Morality points may be earned in the conversation with Diana, including a Paragon interrupt. She gives permission for Shepard to search Nef's room for clues.
Inside there is a note, a diary with 3 entries to listen to, and a statue to examine. You learn that Morinth likes the elcor artist Forta, the vid Vaenia, the drug Hallex, and that the password for the VIP section of Afterlife is Jaruut's name. You and Samara agree on a plan to use yourself as bait to lure Morinth into a trap.
Spacious enough for its very important clientele
Travel to the VIP section of Afterlife (near the Omega Market) and use Jaruut's name to get in. Samara and Shepard then review their plans to trap Morinth.
Near the club entrance is the human male Vij, looking for tickets for a band named Expel 10, in hopes of impressing an asari. If you want, tell him to lay off for Renegade points. Shepard can then interact with the people in the club to attract Morinth's attention.
After three successful activities, Morinth will ask you to join her, so you cannot do them all. Warning:  Somehow failing to make an impression on four activities will result in complete mission failure. You're alive, but Morinth will have left, and Samara's loyalty remains unsecured for the rest of the game.
These are the activities:
Help the dancer: A turian named Meln has been insistent in acquiring Hallia for activities other than dancing. If you choose to intervene, Meln tells male Shepard to leave them alone, or alludes to wanting female Shepard in on his fun. You'll deliver a beatdown on him whichever the case. If not, Hallia kneecaps Meln herself, before berating Shepard for not helping, causing the failure of this segment.
Dance with Waera: You must choose the Paragon line on her if you want to dance. The two other lines result in you not making a good impression.
Insult Verf: The krogan talks trash against humans as you walk into his corner of the bar. If you challenge him to a fight outside, Shepard and Verf have a staredown, which Shepard wins. If you choose any other reply, you'll fail to register on Morinth's attention.
Intimidate muggers: Vertin and Huck, two turian would-be muggers, are discussing their plans for the night in a corner of the bar, apparently to make enough credits to get their boss Hink off their backs. If you intimidate them, it results in a quick fight and some Renegade points. If you don't want the Renegade points, you can tell them to get out, but not after bribing them. Note that you won't actually lose any credits.
Buy a round of drinks: You only get one chance to talk to the bartender Edwin. If you have enough Paragon points, you can smoothly convince him to issue a round of drinks ""on the house"". Alternatively, you can offer to buy the club one round yourself. Again, you won't lose credits.
Help the journalist: Talk to the smoking human Horftin to begin this mini sidestory. Unlike the other activities, you can hear Horftin out if you refused him the first time. Horftin and his companion Moirall had been profiling gang leaders in secret, and Horftin has learned that Moirall's cover has been blown. Talk to Florit, the gang leader in question, on the other side of the club, and use the agreed-upon warning phrase within Moirall's hearing in this order: ""terminal"" and ""eternity"". Note that any other dialogue choices will annoy Florit and he refuses to deal with you further, worrying Horftin and causing the failure of this segment.
To maximize morality points, the player should Intimidate the krogan Verf, Charm the bartender Edwin for a round of drinks on the house, and finally, Intimidate the would-be muggers Vertin and Huck.
Once her attention has been piqued, Morinth takes Shepard to her booth for a personal chat. If Shepard is confident, expresses a desire for violence, and uses the clues previously learned, Morinth will invite Shepard to her apartment. For each of the three main topics, these will keep Morinth's interest:
Travel, enjoying the danger, and the belief that power is its own reward.
Music, the band Expel 10, a history with drugs, new drug interests, or mentioning the Hallex.
Art and ""vids"" and the violence contained within them. Mentioning Vaenia and Forta specifically always works.
A sword, a rifle upgrade, a pill bottle, Morinth herself, a chess set, and a krogan statue
Note:  Avoid speaking of family and justicars, as this links to Samara and thus cannot be used as conversation points. Using either Paragon or Renegade conversation options during your talk with Morinth helps to ensure success, but is not required if you follow the above conversation paths. If you do choose the moral replies, a Charm option will be required to avoid losing her interest on the Travel and Art topics and an Intimidate for Drugs; however, for each of the three topics, one of the options on the right will be a failure and will lessen Morinth's interest. If you fail to keep her interest at any three points in the conversation, she will leave and you will fail the loyalty mission.
When you have Morinth's complete attention, she offers to take you to her apartment. Shepard can examine various items in Morinth's room:
Sculpture - a lifesize statue of a krogan gifted to Morinth by a suitor she claims has even less personality than the statue.
Chess set - Morinth shares her cunning mindset.
Door - it's locked, and Morinth doesn't want you going anywhere but near her.
Sword - Morinth mentions her previous dueling hobby and shares her vicious mindset.
Pill Bottle - contains Hallex, but Morinth would rather have you with your faculties still sharp.
Assault Rifle - Can be scanned for an Assault Rifle Damage research project.
Choose your future squadmate carefully
Whenever you're ready, engage Morinth in conversation. The first two dialogue choices do not matter. For the third dialogue choice, you can use Charm or Intimidate to resist Morinth's seduction. This has an extremely demanding morality check: to pass it you will need to have gained almost all the Paragon or Renegade points available to you in missions you have completed to date.
The jig is up and Samara enters the room. She and Morinth have a biotic battle, but they are evenly matched. If you were able to resist Morinth earlier, you can choose whether to support Samara or Morinth, and will receive big dose of morality points in one direction or another. If you didn't use the persuasion options earlier and allowed Shepard to be ""brainwashed"", then you automatically help Samara and you will not receive any morality points.
If Morinth is killed, Samara becomes loyal and her Reave power is unlocked.
If Samara is killed, Morinth disguises herself and assumes the place of her mother, so that no one else on Normandy is aware of Samara's death and Morinth's substitution. Only a few people—Kelly Chambers and Kasumi Goto— may notice a change in ""Samara's"" behavior, but won't act on it. Morinth is automatically loyal and has the Dominate power.
Whoever emerges as the victor, she will give you a chance to look around the apartment before you can leave, either by speaking with her or through the now unlocked door. If Morinth lived, you can still ask about the various items in her apartment, otherwise the options are gone if Samara lived. After the mission summary screen you are returned to the Omega markets."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Collector_Base:_Infiltration,"This mission is triggered as part of the Stop the Collectors: Defeat the Collectors mission, once you have managed to pass through the Omega 4 Relay and have crash landed on the Collectors' base.","Instead of facing Collectors head on, just take the well-covered road in the background
Note: At the start of all three major segments of the Collector Base mission including this one, your medi-gel and heavy weapon ammo are given a complete refill to 100% capacity.
The initial area is clear of Collectors but once you reach a fork in the road the Collectors swoop in, so take cover and prepare for a fight. Collectors fly in from the left open area, so if you're in a hurry just ignore their fire and take the right path. Your tech specialist moves through the thermal vent and later informs you that there are obstructions in the way preventing them from proceeding. These obstructions are valves which can be opened by pressing green buttons found throughout the level.
After removing the first obstruction, a bar will appear in the lower right of the screen showing how much time the specialist has. If the bar runs out then the mission ends in a critical mission failure as the specialist gets fried. On higher difficulties, it is hard to take the Collectors out fast enough to prevent a heat buildup, so on some occasions you may have to activate the gate controls while under fire. Having a shield-boosting power like Barrier or Fortification, can be a good asset in this situation.
Tip: If you reach a gate control with plenty of time to spare and there are enemies about, hold off on activating the gate control while you kill more enemies. Since activating the gate control will reset to the full length of the next timer no matter how low you've let the bar drop, you'll be gaining extra time. Note that activating each successive gate also replenishes most of your normal weapon ammo, another reason you may sometimes wish to leave gate activation for ""the right moment"".
Barricades can be good or bad, depending on who's (or what's) behind them
The next two valves are guarded by two sets of three Collectors, one of which will always be immediately possessed by Harbinger. Once you activate the fourth gate move fast and you will emerge onto more platforms. More Collectors will swoop in and attack. Take out the Collectors and move to activate the fifth gate. The sixth gate is down the hall and requires no fighting.
Tip: It may be worthwhile to leave this valve until you've killed a few more Collectors, since it will save time that you'll sorely need in the next area.
Note:  Activating the sixth valve is also the last autosave of this mission segment.
There are three Collectors around the corner; eliminate them quickly while they are clustered, then climb into the final room. Caution: For some reason there appears to be some kind of invisible ""barrier"" that blocks powers right as you turn the corner to face the three Collectors. This barrier doesn't block weapon fire, only powers. Pushing past this ""barrier"" and getting right into the faces of the Collectors will let you hit them with powers but on higher difficulties this can be risky.
There are two gates, a time limit, and two waves of Collector Drones, Assassins and Harbinger between you and finishing this mission. The two heat exchangers are very near each other. If you are able to distract the enemies or suppress their fire well enough to simply run straight to the gate controls, do so. The Infiltrator with Tactical Cloak has an easy time of this.
Note:  All of the gates must be opened in order for the specialist to proceed except for the final gate. 
Getting to the last gate and unlocking it triggers the end of the mission even if you never unlocked some of the preceding gates.
Instead of dashing to the final heat exchanger on the middle exposed path (lower right in the image), tag it through taking the left path instead (cross the small bridge)
From the point of entry the seventh heat exchanger is right in front of you, with free cover to boot. The eighth and final heat exchanger can be accessed through two ways: from the seventh valve, left path and middle path. The middle path is exposed while the left has decent cover opportunities.
If you insist on taking all enemies out go right ahead as this isn't an infinite spawn scenario. If you are having problems taking out the Collectors then you can leave your specialist hanging until the last minute – take cover next to the seventh heat exchanger and keep shooting as long as the timer allows.
Once the final gate is open, regardless of any remaining enemies (or any other unopened gates) the mission ends.
The diversion team charges into the safe area and attempts to hold their ground while the tech specialist opens the door to let in Shepard's squad. Once Shepard and the squad get in, the specialist attempts to close the door again. If you chose an ideal specialist, the door closes. If not, the specialist manages to close the door but will be shot dead before finishing the task. Also, if you chose a non-ideal second fire team leader, the specialist will still be shot, even if loyal and ideal.
The room you enter holds giant tubes and a disturbing secret."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Legion:_A_House_Divided,"Prerequisite: Reaper IFF,  not selling Legion to Cerberus and activating it
The player will recover Legion at the end of the Reaper IFF mission and may choose to keep it onboard and activate it. Sometime after activating Legion, Kelly will say that Legion wants to talk. If the player has already completed every other major mission (NOT assignments), this mission will be available immediately after talking to Legion for the first time, which also prevents Shepard from immediately leaving the Normandy during the IFF installation when accessing the Galaxy Map. The heretic geth have written a virus that would bring all geth to their side. The virus is at Heretic Station.","Heretic Station Approach[]
Heretic Station
Shepard and the team approach Heretic Station undetected because of the Normandy's stealth systems. Joker remarks that should any geth look out a window they are not cloaked to the visible spectrum; however, Legion replies that windows are a structural weakness that are not present on the station. The squad boards the station.
Heretic Station Entrance[]
When you arrive Legion tells Shepard that there is no air and little gravity because the geth require neither. Legion then informs Shepard that there is an alternative option to the plan. Instead of destroying the station, Legion says that the virus is finished and Legion could modify the virus and bring the geth back into the main geth fold, which would stop them from aiding the Reapers. Legion is unsure about either path and when asked says it needs more data before drawing a conclusion. Move down the hall, grab the med-kit with medi-gel and head into the next room.
Upon entering the room, Legion will say that the geth are currently in separate nodes to clear out the excess data that Legion uploaded at the start of the mission. The green lines on the floor of the rooms should not be crossed unless you are in position to take out the geth attached to the hubs. Your squadmates can also cross the lines and trip the alarms. Note:  Position-changing powers like Charge or Shadow Strike will refuse to lock on an enemy even if there's a clear unobstructed path, as long as the alarms haven't been tripped. The restriction is removed once the lines turn red.
Move around the room and get into position before stepping on the line. Overloading or destroying the hubs sends the geth attached to it into shock for a few seconds and allows you to make the first strike. The Geth Troopers and Geth Hunter that were attached to the node eject and attack you. It is easy to take them down before they have a real chance to hurt you. When they are down a cutscene will play and Legion will explain how the hubs work and explain the shared geth experience. You can again ask about the decision but again Legion is unsure. Salvage the Geth Hub (+3000 credits) before leaving.
The Rocket Drone has an explosive personality, but is uninterested in the Geth Hunter
The next hallway contains some inactive Rocket Drones. Legion says that it can hack them and they will fight for about 10 seconds before they self-destruct. As you move down the hallway the door at the other end will open and some geth will spill out. Hack the Rocket Drones, take cover and fight them until they fall. Move on and into the next room.
Note: You can take friendly fire from the Rocket Drones, so don't stand in front of them! You can also be damaged when they self-destruct or are destroyed by enemy fire.
Be careful as you enter this room because there are two geth hubs. One ahead to the left in the alcove; the second is in an alcove next to the exit door. You will have to cross the lines to get into cover for this room but focus on the geth ahead of you for now. Quickly cross the line and overload the hub if you can (shoot it if you can't), thus activating the geth. Concentrate fire on the dangerous Geth Hunter to make sure it goes down immediately. Once those geth are down, make sure to take out the other Hunter first so it does not close in, then move to where the other hub is and take out the other geth. You can also use the window of sorts on the entrance hallway for another good position for the second group. When the geth finally fall, salvage the first Geth Hub (+3000 credits) and then salvage the second Geth Hub (+3000 credits) and move into the hallway.
Legion works on building consensus with the heretic geth
This hallway has some Geth Troopers so use cover and take them out. When the geth fall move to the end of the hallway and grab the med-kit with medi-gel. Move up the ramps to the next room. It is recommended you save before entering this room. This room contains a storage room of sorts and has little cover. Find what you can, usually along the railings on the side you enter from. There are two Rocket Drones in the center of the room and activate only one at a time. There will be two waves of Troopers and Hunters. Usually the geth would run through the center of the room, but watch out for any that will not go through the center and will go across the sides. Once you manage to take down the enemies, move around the room and collect any thermal clips to refill on ammo.
Move to the door, open it, and go in the hallway. At the other end are some power cells and med-kit with medi-gel, grab them both before moving down the ramps to the next area and deeper into the station. Once you are down the ramps go to the right and pick up a crate of Refined Palladium (+2000 palladium) and the head over to the door. Save the game before going in.
Heretic Station Interior[]
Once in the next room immediately take cover and combat the geth that are already in the room. There is a collection of two Geth Troopers and a Geth Hunter that will cloak once you enter the room. Target the Hunter first and then the Troopers. There is an inactive Rocket Drone in the room that can assist you in this fight. Once the geth are down the non-Legion squadmate will ask how long the room outside the windows is. Legion responds that the station is over 15 kilometers long and the room likely runs the length of it. Before leaving the room go behind where you entered to bypass a Geth Terminal for a Geth Shield Boost upgrade. Move through the next door and watch out for the data lines on the floor as you move up through this room with the four massive tanks.
""How could we have become so different? Why can we no longer understand each other? What did we do wrong?""
Once you emerge in the next room, take cover as there are two more geth hubs in the room, one to your left, and the other to the right. If you can, take out one of the hubs at a time. Pick one of the hubs to which you can get a clear line of sight and either Overload it or shoot it. Try to take out this first group quickly (or at least the Hunter), before the other group of geth emerges from its hub. Now use cover, powers, and whatever else you can do to get the geth to fall the fastest. Note that you can flee back up the ramp you entered from if things get too hot, and if your squadmates fall then reviving them when they are behind the geth will distract them and help you get back into the fight.
Tip: If you have the Shockwave power available it's possible to trigger this fight from the relative safety of the ramp leading into the area by aiming through the walls of the server rooms.  If you get the aim right you can destroy one of the geth server hubs from this location which will trigger all of the geth to go active and attack.  All of the cloaked Hunters will charge up the ramp at you but you'll have plenty of time and space to see them coming and take them out or hack them while the other geth won't come after you and you can keep retreating up the ramp as needed.  Be sure to order your squadmates to hold position or retreat as needed or they may charge out to their deaths.  If you don't have Shockwave available the M-490 Blackstorm's projectile can damage enemies through walls so if you don't mind spending the ammo firing a shot against the wall of one of the server rooms is another way to trigger the fight without going all the way down the ramp.
Tip: Spamming the M-622 Avalanche or another heavy weapon at one of the geth hub rooms will let you knock one group of geth out of the fight and still have time to get to cover before the second group emerges.  Hitting the group with one or two shield stripping abilities first will help soften them up.
Once they are down, salvage the first Geth Hub (+3000 credits), salvage the second Geth Hub (+3000 credits), and then pick up clips and move on. The next hallway contains what appears to be a massive server room. When you pass one of the windows, you can initiate a conversation with Legion. It will explain that the room is a server room, of sorts: the massive computers contain the sum of the collective memories of these geth. Legion takes a good look and reflects on how the heretic geth and the true geth have grown apart. You can comment on that and ask him about the decision. It will still be unsure and a debate will be raging in the core.
Move into the next room and for once, there are no enemies. Take a moment to observe your surroundings and don't activate any of the Rocket Drones yet as you will need them in a few minutes. Note the location of the only two ammo cartridges in the room – these respawn, and you will likely need to return to them from time to time during the upcoming battle.
Note:  There is a med-kit next to the geth console that you can take now or after the battle.
Move to the console in the middle, save your game, select the console, and dialogue will appear with some options. Legion says that the virus is completed and that it must be deleted. Legion will say that while the virus is being deleted/altered, all the geth on the station will become aware of the squad's presence and will try to stop them. Select the dialogue option to proceed and prepare for wave after wave of geth.
Hold Position[]
Legion asks Shepard to make a decision
This next area is just about killing geth before they have a chance to get to your position. The waves are composed as follows:
Wave 1: Geth Troopers
Wave 2: Geth Troopers, Geth Rocket Troopers
Wave 3: Geth Troopers, Geth Hunters
Wave 4: Geth Troopers, Geth Rocket Troopers, Geth Hunters
Note:  The number of waves and their compositions are the same on any difficulty level, but it is not clear if the same is true of the number of enemies within each wave.
Combat Strategy: Taking cover behind the three boxes that form an arc behind the geth terminal is generally the best place to complete this battle at all difficulty levels. Helpfully, there is a respawning thermal clip at this location. All of the geth that climb up will take cover at the top of the right and left staircases and even the Hunters usually won't storm your position, though it's wise to keep visually scanning both left and right sides to make sure you're not being flanked.
Combat Tips:
Don’t activate all the Rocket Drones in one wave and try to save as many as possible for later waves that are harder. If you manage to save everything until at least the Hunters start to appear, you will be much safer.
There are six Rocket Drones on the lower level and two on the upper level, save the last two on the upper level for the last wave, and not until you need them.
There is a limit to how many defenses Legion can hack at a time (about 2-3) if you try to hack too many Legion will state that it is unable to do so.
Use AI Hacking from Legion and as many other sources as possible to get the geth to thin their own ranks; this is also important as it prevents the geth from focusing on and destroying any of the Rocket Drones you hack. Be proactive and start hacking the geth from the upper level while the waves are approaching from the lower level, then retreat back to cover once they reach the stairs. Try to prioritize hacking the Rocket Troopers as their shots deal high damage and can knock other geth off their feet. Geth Hunters are also good targets.
Downed squadmates revive automatically once a wave is fully eliminated so if one dies but the wave has thinned out consider saving your medi-gel.
Your squadmates will forget their hold orders between waves so put them back into cover if they pop out.
Legion defers to Shepard's judgment
Once all the geth are down you re-engage in conversation with Legion. It states that the virus has been deleted and asks what the next step is. You can, for the last time, ask for Legion's opinion and again it cannot decide. You can also ask why it is leaving the decision to you. It replies that you have fought the heretic geth and that is why the decision is left to Shepard. Make your choice.
Rewrite the heretics (Paragon):
Legion will state that the station will release an EMP to rewrite them and it will also damage any unshielded organic tissue in a large radius. The station is unshielded. Your other squadmate states that that would have been nice to know earlier.
This solution might present a problem down the road with the integration of the memories of the heretic geth into the geth collective, and it will make the geth stronger as a whole. You will also be awarded a large number of Paragon points.
Destroy the heretics (Renegade):
Legion states that it will collapse the antimatter confinement bottle in the station's core, destroying the station and anything left onboard.
While this will destroy the main heretic stronghold there will still be other holdouts which may present problems in the future. This option will award substantial Renegade points.
No matter your choice, you will be left with only three minutes to evacuate the station.
Evacuation[]
The geth do not seem keen on the Commander leaving the station
Once the conversation ends, the three-minute countdown will start. At the end of those three minutes, you will die if you can't get out. This is actually plenty of time to destroy all the remaining enemies as long as you don't mess around, so move deliberately but don't panic as that can lead to fatal mistakes. Go down the hallway to the right of the console and take cover as the geth will try to stop you. Keep moving and shooting until you reach the second turn. Send your squad in first because there is a Geth Prime around the corner. Sending your squadmates in first will distract it while you can use the corner as cover to take out the Geth Prime. Watch your remaining time, because if you take too long you will die.
Tip: You do not have to defeat all the enemies to complete the mission – tapping the airlock at the other end of the room will result in instant victory and a cutscene. An Infiltrator, for instance, can cloak and need not hang around to take down the Geth Prime, and other classes may also be able to ""leave early"" once the geth are distracted (e.g. with AI Hacking, Stasis, or even Charge).
When you can, move across the room they were in and to the door to exit back to the Normandy. The ending cutscene will play, showing your decision of whether to rewrite the heretics or blow up the station. If you chose to rewrite, an EMP blast will show; if you chose to destroy the base, it will blow up."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Prologue:_Save_Joker,"Mysterious new players conspire
You acquire this mission immediately after importing a character or upon generating a new character. You do not get the opportunity to make any changes to your character until after this prologue and a 10-minute cutscene.
This mission, the first one in the game, does not involve any combat, no morality points are awarded for any dialogue choices, and it is not possible to save or access certain other menu options. It is mainly intended to present you with the events that lead to Commander Shepard's disappearance, taking place roughly two years before the events of Mass Effect 2.","The SSV Normandy patrols for the geth
The game opens with a conversation between the Illusive Man and Miranda Lawson discussing the outcome of the Battle of the Citadel. If you imported a character from Mass Effect, the conversation will reflect the choice Shepard made regarding whether the Citadel Council was saved or lost. If you created a new character for Mass Effect 2, the default decision is that the Council was lost in the course of the battle.
The next scene cuts to the SSV Normandy. In the wake of the attack on the Citadel, led by Sovereign and its Spectre puppet Saren Arterius, the Council has dispatched Normandy to clean up the remaining geth. Shortly after, the Normandy emerges in the Amada System of the Omega Nebula, and it detects the approach of an unknown ship.
The Normandy with a new sunroof
The unknown vessel attacks with a beam weapon that immediately cuts through the Normandy's kinetic barriers and armor, crippling the ship and breaching the hull in several places. Shepard issues an evacuation order, but a squadmate—either Ashley Williams, Kaidan Alenko or Liara T'Soni, depending on romantic attachment, Shepard's decision on Virmire, or the gender of a new character—tells the Commander that Joker, the ship's helmsman, is reluctant to leave. After convincing the squadmate to abandon ship with the rest of the crew, Shepard must head to the bridge and convince Joker to leave as well.
Note:  In the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2, Liara T'Soni will always be the one to show up for Shepard in this scene, even when importing a save from Mass Effect.
Shepard should walk through the blazing hallways keeping to the left or the right up a set of stairs to reach the Command Deck, which is now exposed to open space as the ceiling has been completely disintegrated with large sections of the hull breached. Shepard should now walk forward to the cockpit, passing through a kinetic airlock where Joker can be found.
Joker accepts the Normandy is lost
When Shepard reaches the bridge, Joker says that he believes the ship can still be saved, but finally gives up after Shepard, politely or aggressively, convinces him otherwise.
Shepard then carries Joker to the escape pod, securing him inside. Before Shepard can enter the pod, however, the cruiser attacks again, and the resulting blast throws Shepard away from the pod forcing Shepard to eject the pod with only Joker inside, saving Joker's life. Seconds later, a final blast obliterates the Normandy, and the resulting explosion sends Shepard flying into space, where it soon appears Shepard's suit has been damaged and is rapidly leaking air. Shepard struggles for a brief moment before losing consciousness, and is last seen drifting towards a nearby planet.

Missions

Prologue: Awakening"
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Grunt:_Rite_of_Passage,"Prerequisite: Horizon (mission),  and waking Grunt following Dossier: The Warlord
This is Grunt's loyalty mission, in which he requests that Shepard travel to Tuchanka so that he may complete the krogan Rite of Passage.
In the cargo hold of the Normandy SR-2, Grunt will pace back and forth restlessly as he tells Shepard that he is unnerved by his intense desire to destroy and kill. It has become an involuntary compulsion rather than an intentional, pleasure-seeking activity. He requests that Shepard take him to Tuchanka, as EDI is lacking in the area of medical records pertaining to krogan, who now fiercely guard their medical data since the salarians used it against them with the genophage.","Let's get started, Shepard. Hit the Keystone! Let's get started, Shepard. Hit the Keystone! Let's get started, Shepard...
With Grunt in your party, speak with the current leader of Clan Urdnot, who is either Shepard's old friend, Wrex, or (if he died on Virmire or was never recruited) his brother, Wreav. Either will note that Grunt is not sick, he is of the age where he must complete the krogan Rite of Passage, and refers the party to the clan Shaman. The clan Shaman will relate various information about the rite, as well as krogan history and culture. Gatatog Uvenk will protest Grunt taking the Rite, as he is tank bred. You can get Uvenk to stand down in a number of ways. After Shepard agrees to be Grunt's krantt, the Shaman sends Grunt and company to the traditional grounds of the Rite.
The Keystone[]
To begin each of the three waves of the Rite, you will need to activate the ""keystone"" that's near the central stairs where Shepard is standing when you enter the area.
Grunt getting ready to stomp some varren.
Before beginning the first wave, take a moment to run bypasses on the turbine parts on either side of the central stairs, get the platinum, and salvage the credits from four dead krogan on the upper level (+12,900 credits total). There are also three Med-Kits and two power cells.
Combat Tip: It is best to leave the power cells and medkits where they are until you need them. However, one power cell box and one medkit are on the lower level - you may wish to collect them before the third wave starts. Finally, as soon as you beat the third wave you will no longer be able to loot any of the objects, so be sure to get them all picked up before that happens.
Remember to get all of your ammo powers equipped - preferably Incendiary, Warp or best of all Armor-Piercing. Also before hitting the keystone, you can take this time to scout out the area and note the locations of ammo cartridges, all of which will respawn repeatedly throughout the Rite. Grunt will ""helpfully"" remind you to hit the keystone precisely every fifteen seconds when you are between waves, just to keep you from getting too distracted.
Wave One[]
Can't fight these critters but they will drop enemies you and Grunt can fight.
Varren - The first wave summons multitudes of varren and they all descend upon Shepard, Grunt and the third party member. Since they can only attack at melee distance, they should all be dispatched at range. They come from two sides of the map at the opposite corners from the switch, so you need to stay sharp and not leave your back unguarded.
Combat Tip: Get the armor stripped off each varren as quickly as possible so that you can then use powers to slow down their approach. Be careful with Shepard's powers however: Varren are quite fast, fast enough to outrun powers with slower moving projectiles such as most biotics or Incinerate. Time and aim powers carefully to avoid getting juked, or use a power with an instant effect such as Neural Shock or very large area of effect such as Shockwave to compensate. This isn't an issue with squad powers as those are instant.
Note: It is possible to face the varren all from one side if Shepard quickly makes it to the middle of the center set of stairs (it's really a bit to the right of center). The varren will all come up at Shepard up from the bottom of these stairs as it is the quickest route to Shepard and the team.
Once all the enemies are down, Grunt will begin reminding you to hit the keystone. Before you do that, walk around and refill all your ammo.
Wave Two[]
Grunt warming himself with klixen fire.
Klixen - These fire-breathing creatures make up the second wave and are delivered by Harvesters on either side of the map; don't waste your ammo, the Harvesters cannot be killed. The klixen will need to be taken out while you are still out of their fire-breathing range or they can quickly cause havoc and deal a lot of damage. They are resistant to Incendiary Ammo and Incinerate (but their armor isn't) and they're weak against Armor-Piercing Ammo, Reave and Warp Ammo.
Combat Tip: Once you've stripped their armor, abilities like Grunt's Concussive Shot or Jacob's Pull can stop the klixen before they get too close.
Tip: If you watch your teammates carefully, they will automatically face the direction of the next incoming harvester.
Tip: Unlike Varren, Klixen are quite slow and you can easily stay out of range of their attacks by continuously moving and shooting. Your squadmates will have to be ordered to do this or they will stand and fight (and often die) but Shepard alone can beat this section simply by continuously moving and shooting/using powers while picking up respawning thermal clips. Downed squadmates will automatically revive at the end of this (and all other) waves.
Once the klixen stop coming, Grunt will again start reminding you to hit the keystone. Refill your ammo before you do so, and consider collecting the medkit and power cells that are down on the lower level before you begin wave three -- they will be difficult to collect during the upcoming battle.
Wave Three[]
Thresher Maw! This is not so much a wave as it is a giant creature attack. There is only one Thresher Maw and the primary objective is simply to survive. All you have to do is survive the attack for five minutes and the test will be ended, though there are additional dialogue accolades if you succeed in taking it down.
Grunt ponders whether to watch the Thresher Maw eat a Cain slug or to blast at it while it eats the Cain slug.
If you manage to kill the Thresher Maw, you gain the respect of the krogan and the Rite ends. The Thresher Maw moves around the outskirts of the map, but its trail of flying dirt clods is easy to follow when it dives back underground. The Thresher Maw can destroy the ""merely metal"" structures, so try to avoid those for cover and go for the sturdier stone/concrete pillars and walls instead. Its acid spit is an area of effect attack and will accurately shoot at you even if you're cloaked. The blue tongue is not a weak spot—shooting it does not cause any additional damage.
Combat Strategy: There is one indestructible stone pillar on the low ground area of the level—to the right as you face out from the keystone—that you can use to take cover from the Maw from any direction it might appear. Additionally, there are two respawning thermal clips at the base of this pillar as well as easy access to a medi-gel and power cells on the higher ground that you can pick up from the edge of the raised area without needing to climb up. This is without a doubt the optimal place to fight the Maw, as all other locations will involve considerable running about when the Maw moves. Place your squadmates in cover behind the other two indestructible pillars on the high ground and they should also be safe and might even draw the Maw's fire giving you free rein. If a squadmate does go down it's not the end of the world: Shepard alone is more than enough to beat the Maw even on Insanity.
Combat Tips:
The metal pillars can be destroyed by the Thresher Maw in one hit, but any cover made of stone/concrete is not destructible. You should always try to interpose indestructible cover between yourself and the Maw. The Maw's spit projectile does have an area of effect so try to be as completely in cover as possible when the Maw attacks to ensure you are not hit.
Shepard's shields take longer than usual to recover after an acid hit, so be careful. On the plus side it takes about three consecutive hits to kill Shepard even on Insanity. Don't hesitate to use a medi-gel to quickly restore your shields (provided you have the Emergency Shielding medi-gel upgrade).
A well-upgraded heavy pistol is more than sufficient to take out the Maw as long as you take advantage of respawning thermal clips to keep replenishing its ammo.
On Insanity, the Thresher Maw's sheer amount of health makes using heavy weapons inefficient. Conventional weapons modded with anti-armor ammo powers are your best bet.
Though nominally ineffective against armor, Grunt's Concussive Shot can still ""stagger"" the Maw, reducing the number of acid shots it will take before retreating.
Zaeed's Inferno Grenade, Mordin's Incinerate, and Samara's Reave are examples of good squadmate attacks to use. Using weapons with high armor penetration such as the Widow, M-76 Revenant, M-96 Mattock, or most pistols will help a lot.
The Cain will usually only damage half the Thresher Maw's health on Insanity.
The Thresher Maw is immune to the effects of Stasis.
Uvenk's Folly[]
Matters finally come to a head with Uvenk
After the Thresher Maw is destroyed or the timer hits the five-minute mark, the Rite of Passage is officially over. However, at that point Gatatog Uvenk and his krantt make an appearance. During the cutscene, Uvenk expresses that he is impressed by Grunt's accomplishment. He then seeks out a loophole that he believes will allow him to accept Grunt. Grunt, however, is not at all pleased by what Uvenk is saying as he would be treated little better than a trophy for Clan Gatatog.
No matter what conversation option Shepard chooses, they end up engaging Uvenk and his krantt. Uvenk has a barrier and armor that need to be taken down to kill him and there are four Gatatog Warriors with him. After the cutscene, be ready to take cover immediately and order your squad to do the same.
Combat Tip: For whatever reason most of the krogan, including Gatatog, will move rapidly away at the beginning of the combat, so you will really only be dealing with one or two krogan attacking at any given time - concentrate on one attacker and obliterate it before it can get behind your cover. Warning: Summoning a Combat Drone on top of the krogan at the start of this encounter will backfire by making all the krogan bum rush your position instead of retreating like they normally would. You don't want that.
Note: If you have a heavy weapon with good area of effect and still have ammo, you can wreak havoc on the krogan by targeting them at the start of the engagement while they are all clumped together.
Note: There are two krogan corpses that can be searched (1200 and 900 credits) and two medi-gel packs to be picked up during the fight against Uvenk, but you have to loot them before finishing the fight because you will automatically leave the area. One is located down the stairs by the medi-gel packs and the other is behind the last barricade where Gatatog and his troops are positioned. It is advisable to wait until most of the enemies are dead before going for this last one.
Once the final enemy falls, you will automatically return to the Urdnot camp and speak to the Shaman. The Shaman will welcome Grunt as a full-fledged member of Clan Urdnot and award you a shotgun damage upgrade. Once you're done speaking with the Shaman, the mission will end. Once the mission has ended, a discount will automatically be granted at Fortack's Database; if you speak with Fortack he will address Grunt as Urdnot's new warrior, or if Grunt is not present, he acknowledges Shepard as Grunt's krantt."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Collector_Ship_(mission),"The true nature of the trigger for this mission is not fully understood, as there are a few reports of players completing more than five missions before triggering this mission, but it usually works like this:
After the mission on Horizon, a five-mission countdown begins, after which Shepard will be unable to access the Galaxy Map and instead must report to the briefing room to speak with the Illusive Man, who will dispatch Shepard to investigate a disabled Collector Cruiser. At that point completing the mission becomes the only way forward.
Even N7 assignments (e.g. ""anomalies"") count as a mission, so pick your five missions carefully. Non-combat assignments (e.g. Omega: Packages for Ish) do not count.
Even though Overlord technically consists of four separate assignments, it only counts as one for purposes of the countdown.
If the fifth mission is one of the two loyalty missions on Tuchanka or the Citadel, you can complete the other one before returning to the Normandy SR-2. Because of the order and tempo with which loyalty missions are acquired, the second Citadel mission will only become available in time if you leave Grunt in his tank.
Finally, it is possible to complete Miranda's loyalty mission fifth and then recruit Thane or Samara or complete Lair of the Shadow Broker as an extra mission, but only if Jack's loyalty mission has not yet been completed (because while Miranda's mission normally ends back on Ilium, if Jack is loyal then Shepard returns immediately to the Normandy for their argument).
This mission will not trigger until eight squad members have been recruited, and indeed the official Prima Publishing Collector's Edition guide states explicitly (p. 114) that the story will not advance without eight squad members. Grunt does not count as a squad member until he is awakened from his tank. The addition of Kasumi and Zaeed in DLC packs, along with the ease of recruiting them, tends to make this condition moot for many players unless they delay waking Grunt.
Note:  Though you'll have no choice but to complete this mission once it appears, any other missions that you didn't get to by this point can still be done afterwards.","Cruiser Entrance[]
EDI reports results of the Collectors' experiments
This mission is one of the most linear in the entire game. Start moving down the open hallway, and EDI will comment that the ship's signatures match those of the Collector Vessel that attacked Horizon. There is no need to worry about any enemies for a while yet so just keep moving forward. Upon arriving at a bend in the passage you encounter a pod where your squadmates will make some comments. Keep moving down the hall until you reach a pile of dead bodies where you can earn some morality points depending on your dialogue choice. Continue down the tunnel until you reach some salvageable Collector Technology (+7500 credits) on the right. Salvage it and move up to get the med-kit with medi-gel. Up ahead is a Control Terminal next to the body of a dead Collector in a pod.
A close approach will select the Control Terminal automatically. It is strongly recommended that you create a permanent save point before selecting the terminal, as you will be given a choice that can have permanent effects on your character throughout both your current game and any subsequent playthroughs with the same character. If you make a choice you end up not liking, reloading this save can give you the option of doing things differently.
When you access the terminal a squadmate makes a comment while Shepard contacts EDI, who will tell you about the experiments. Apparently, the Collectors were making fundamental ""genetic comparisons between their species and humanity."" Shepard can ask a question, and the conversation shifts to the Normandy's bridge where a holographic display and EDI's analysis reveals something shocking. The Collectors' DNA matches that of the Protheans! Respond to this however you choose. You can ask questions until you are satisfied, then end the conversation; you then reach down toward a pile of weapons.
Advanced Weapon Training[]
After the conversation, a menu will appear allowing you to choose one of three weapon-training options, which enables you to use the weapon in combat. If your character already has that weapon proficiency, you instead have the option of choosing a powerful, unique weapon of that class. For example, an Infiltrator will have the option to take the unique sniper rifle, or gain access to either the common assault rifles or the common shotguns. Adepts, Sentinels, and Engineers will only have options to train in the common weapons, and not the unique ones.
Shotgun Training: Soldiers and Vanguards can choose the M-300 Claymore Heavy Shotgun instead.
Assault Rifle Training: Soldiers can choose the M-76 Revenant Light Machine Gun instead.
Sniper Rifle Training: Soldiers and Infiltrators can choose the Widow Anti-Material Rifle instead.
Spoilers and guns - lots of them
Both the training and new weapon only apply to you, not to any other member of the squad. The best choice will depend on your character class and playstyle. Each unique weapon is generally considered the strongest of its class in the game; however, you may want instead to balance your weaknesses with a new weapon type.
Warning:  The training carries through for each new game: you do not get to pick another weapon or additional training on subsequent playthroughs with the same character, so choose wisely. New characters on their first playthrough will always be able to pick a new option.
Caution: The special weapon training can also change the equipped weapons of squadmates. Use the nearby weapons locker to make sure everyone is carrying what you want before proceeding.
Grab the crate of refined element zero (+250 eezo) and the power cells before you continue on.
Into the Belly of the Beast[]
Massive indeed
From here continue moving. You soon enter a larger room to see many pods—some still occupied—above and ahead of you, which evokes some comments from the entire squad as well as EDI, who detects no life signs in the pods (if that offers any relief). Move up some inclines and veer to the right, where you'll find some another salvageable Collector Technology (+15000 credits). Also, a Control Terminal at the end of this path will give a Damage Protection upgrade. Continue moving through the oddly deserted ship. As you walk up a long ramp, Joker comes over the comm and tells you that he and EDI discovered that this is the same Collector ship which attacked the SSV Normandy. Shepard makes the comment that this is too much of a coincidence.
As you round the corner at the top you enter into a massive open area of the ship which apparently holds countless pods. Your squadmates will comment that the Collectors could harvest every human in the Terminus Systems and still not have enough captives to fill all the pods; the Collectors must have one ultimate target: Earth. Now you have yet another reason to stop them, if you didn't have enough already. Move along until you approach an apparent dead end, where one squadmate will take note of a Command Console and the other will ominously wonder about the absence of Collectors. SAVE before you access the console.
Hello there.
Accessing the console sets up a link between EDI and the Collector Ship. EDI begins mining data, and for a few seconds everything seems to be going well, but not for long. In the Normandy's cockpit, Joker's holo-displays begin going blank, followed by the Collector General briefly appearing in the form of a red hologram, causing Joker to respond uneasily. Aboard the Collectors' vessel everything starts to shake as strange things begin happening around your team, prompting the Commander to radio for a status report. Joker responds that there was a power surge, and EDI says that she managed to divert the overload to non-critical systems. Worse, she informs Shepard that this was not a malfunction: it was a trap. The platform the team is standing on suddenly launches into the air, and EDI reports that she's having difficulty maintaining the connection due to ""someone else"" in the system.
When the platform stops in midair, everyone loses their balance and one member of the squad is knocked down. Your squad recovers as EDI says that she has reestablished connection and needs to finish the download before she can override any systems. She will keep you updated on the progress, but in reality the squad will only be safe after defeating the Collector forces rapidly approaching your position on flying platforms of their own. So take cover and prepare for a hard fight.
Sky-High Battle[]
Standard procedure with Collectors on floating platforms: Strip Barriers + Throw them off ASAP
The platform you are on provides some cover and a good position to combat the enemy. Two Collector Drones and a Collector Guardian are the first to drop in; if you can, take them out as fast as possible to prevent Harbinger from possessing them, but this can be difficult on higher difficulties. A platform with a Scion stationed on it will arrive in the first wave and slowly orbit the main platform cluster while you combat the other Collectors, continuously firing its signature shockwave attack that can devastate you and your squad.
As the battle progresses, a second Scion will eventually show up on another orbiting platform as well. You will have to fight a total of three waves of Collector troops who each show up on their own platform that docks with your starting platform. Move from cover to cover as needed and don’t forget to manage the health and abilities of your squadmates. Focus on the Collectors before going after the Scions as they are a more immediate threat, and in the case of Harbinger, a mortal threat if not dealt with quickly. It's still important to keep track of the Scions' positions and to take cover from their attacks as much as possible as they deal a large amount of damage, can stagger you out of cover, and can also delay your shields from recharging with direct hits (a bluish residue will cover you if your shields are disabled in this way).
Take cover away from your squadmates at (A) while they stay at (B), at least initially
Combat Strategy: This is arguably one of the hardest combat encounters in the entire game, however, certain tactics will drastically reduce its difficulty. As mentioned in the preparation section above, bringing Kasumi along for her Flashbang power provides you with an easy way of neutralizing Harbinger when he appears by disabling his biotics. Flashbang can also help create valuable gaps in the firing of the other Collector troops. If you don't have Flashbang Grenade available, a Combat Drone can distract Harbinger fairly well. At the start of combat, it's recommended that you take cover away from your squadmates as the diagram on the right illustrates; this should hopefully keep some heat off your team, and minimizes the danger of Scion shockwaves hitting all of you at once. Don't hesitate to use heavy weapons to quickly take out groups of attacking enemies, and definitely don't hesitate to use Unity if your squadmates are downed, or if you or they are severely injured. If sufficiently upgraded, medi-gel can restore the shields of the entire party, making it effective at counteracting the shield recharge-delaying effects of Scion attacks on a relatively quick cooldown.
Additional Notes:
An ability that lifts an enemy such as Slam, Pull or Throw can be used when the platforms carrying the Collectors are moving in. If a Collector with no barrier is knocked off its feet when the platform is still moving, chances are pretty good that it will plummet to its death when the platform moves away. Crowd-control abilities also reduce incoming enemy fire increasing the longevity of you and your team.
If you have Stasis as your chosen bonus power you can use it to efficiently dispatch the Scions as with proper timing you can freeze them in place while their platforms continue to move, causing them to fall to their deaths after the freeze wears off. Be aware that killing a Scion triggers one of three total platforms of Collector troops to arrive, however. If you don't have Stasis, then defeating the Scions should take a back seat to keeping Harbinger off your platform and killing the Collector troops attacking your squad. If you have one available, tie up one of the Scions with a Combat Drone; otherwise attend to killing them whenever you have a lull between Collector waves.
When Harbinger throws his slow-moving Singularity-like orb, draw it away from your cover so that it will miss, because if it hits, Shepard will be knocked from behind cover and exposed to potentially deadly fire and that cover position will become temporarily unusable.
If you can't disable or distract him, it's critically important to prevent Harbinger from closing to point-blank range, so concentrate your fire on him especially when he gets close. You don't want him flanking you on your platform and driving you out to a bad position where the Scions have clear shots at you. The charged shots of the Geth Plasma Shotgun are one of the fastest ways to eliminate Harbinger's barrier, at which point you should switch to anti-armor weapons and powers to finish him off.
Your squadmates will be preoccupied with shooting at the Scions until they fall, so if you want their help in attacking Harbinger or anything else, you will have to manually order them to do so.
Squadmates can have difficulty climbing up onto the raised platforms that dock with your starting platform (you may have to order them around obstacles with multiple move commands to assist their pathing AI). For this reason, Kasumi can also fail to successfully Shadow Strike the second Scion or any other enemy on the raised platforms. She cannot Shadow Strike the first Scion on the isolated platform.
You can move onto the first platform that docks with your starting platform, and it's a fairly safe place for your party once the first Scion is dead. However, there is some glitchy map architecture that prevents any powers or gunfire from reaching the second Scion from there, even though it might appear you have clear line of sight.
Ideally, get rid of Collectors before Harbinger assumes control, or he'll be making your life more difficult—and shorter.
Once all enemies are finally eliminated, EDI radios that if you access the panel again she can regain control. Before accessing the panel, pick up any dropped thermal clips and some power cells located on one of the platforms that flew in during the battle.
After hitting the panel, there is a brief cutscene during which EDI explains that the distress signal which originated from the Collector ship contains an error that clearly identifies it as a non-turian signal. She further explains that it is not possible that the Illusive Man would have been fooled by it, since she discovered the error using Cerberus detection protocols which he wrote. The only conclusion is that he knowingly sent you into this trap. Respond to that in any way you wish; one or both of your squadmates will also share their own opinions. Joker will then interrupt to tell you to hurry up because the cruiser is powering up its weapons. He will keep you updated over the course of the rest of the mission about this development, but you shouldn't worry too much as you're not under any real time pressure.
Fight Your Way Out[]
Bug spray's not enough to deal with these pests
Save as often as you can from here to the end of the mission, especially on Hardcore and Insanity difficulties.
As you land get off the platform and move. You'll enter a small room with closed doors, one of which EDI will open for you; grab the med-kit with medi-gel, and head through the open door. Warning:  Once you go through the door and drop down, the door slams shut behind you and you are unable to go back.
Soon you come to a close encounter on level terrain, just beyond some salvageable Collector Technology. Slam into cover at the first chance and shoot out the Collector drones that fly in; one of these will be quickly possessed by Harbinger. Focus on taking out Harbinger then focus on the other fodder in the room to prevent it from doing it again, or, if you wish, command your squadmates to attack the Harbinger while you kill the remaining Collectors. That way the Collectors should all die right about the time your squadmates polish off Harbinger.
Combat Strategy: Place your squadmates into cover kneeling down high up on the ramp near the door that just closed behind you. Move down to the flat area to trigger the Collectors. Quickly back up and get into cover behind the pillar against the left wall that contains the salvageable Collector Technology (+7500 credits). From this cover, Harbinger and Collector Drones will not move forward beyond their starting positions and won't shoot at you. Be warned, there is some sort of invisible barrier around the pillar and your own shots will hit that wonky map architecture. You will have trouble using powers from this cover as well. Use your squadmates up on the ramp to throw powers to chip away at the Collectors until they drop.
Alternative Strategy: If you have Flashbang Grenade available or another means of distracting Harbinger such as a Combat Drone, this fight becomes a cinch. Focus on the other Collectors while he is disabled to deny him any further hosts, and then take him out last.
After you put down these enemies, grab the salvageable Collector Technology if you didn't already, and move down a ramp to a larger and more complicated room for another dangerous encounter.
In this next area you really have a fight on your hands; however, there is a lot of cover to take advantage of. Note the ramp on your left as you enter, which leads to an elevated section stretching the length of the room; this section is accessible on the far side of the room as well. The first wave of Collectors will arrive as you enter, more or less in front of you, but keep an eye on them because they may use the high ground to flank you. As usual, Harbinger will also make at least one appearance.
Move around because there are too many flanking opportunities here
Combat Strategy: When you first enter this area, you will notice two ammo clips next to an unusual piece of cover shaped like part of a hexagon. This is the safest place to take cover and remain for most of the battle, as it not only prevents enemies from flanking you but also shields you from enemies up the ramp on the upper level. You can also keep your squadmates back in cover on the ramp you entered from so that they are safely out of the way for this battle. Keep Harbinger away from you of course, but if he's not an immediate threat prioritize picking off the Drones and Guardians, usually in that order. After you eliminate several of the attackers, a group of Abominations will approach from a distance and should always be priority targets because of their explosive suicide attack. Burn their armor away if they have any, disable them with powers, and finish them off if they don't spontaneously explode.
Additional Notes:
Flashbang Grenade not only disables Harbinger, it's quite useful against Guardians as it will disable their shields and stun anything in the vicinity.
Having a sniper rifle can definitely make eliminating the Collector troops much easier in this fight as many of them are at long range and stubbornly cling to cover. If you don't have a sniper rifle then any other accurate weapon like the M-12 Locust is your next best bet. Patiently wear down the Collectors one by one.
To make it easier to land shots and powers on the Collectors ducking in and out of cover, consider using a squadmate power to briefly stun them while you line up your shot or launch your own power; even if the Collector still has a barrier, using a power like Throw or Flashbang on it will still stagger it momentarily.
Having Barrier, Geth Shield Boost, or Fortification as a bonus power can really help on higher difficulties as you will probably be losing your shield a lot while trading shots with the Collectors and Harbinger. Having a tougher shield lets you trade damage more efficiently and gives you a ""panic button"" to instantly restore your shields if you come under more fire than you expected.
There is some more glitchy map architecture here that can prevent any hitscan (instant cast, non-projectile) powers, including squadmates' powers, from landing on enemies on the high ground. You'll either have to use your own projectile powers and weapon fire to take them down from where you enter, or take the braver step of moving your party forward to get unobstructed angles.
Once you eliminate all the enemies (you'll face 4-5 waves), head to the other end of the room and pick up the power cells, a med-kit with medi-gel, and another crate of refined element zero (+250 eezo).
Warning:  Save your game here before the drop down into the next area.
Praetorian: The Sequel[]
Literal piercing eyes that can strip shields and health in no time
After you drop down into the next room and proceed inside a short distance, EDI will come over the comm telling you that she has opened a door at the other end of the room. There are two problems: first, Collectors and Husks enter the area to block your path; second, and more alarmingly, there is a Praetorian flying at you as well. Once the Husks are eliminated, two Collector Drones will fly in near the far end of the chamber. This Praetorian duel will be more difficult than the one on Horizon due to the presence of other opponents, but the same principles for fighting it still apply, you just need to eliminate the other threats as fast as possible so that you can then devote all your attention to the hovering monstrosity.
There are many ways to approach this fight, but ordering your squadmates to (A) while leading the Praetorian in circles around the pillar at (B) works well once all extraneous threats have been eliminated.
After you drop down into the area but before you move forward to trigger the fight (you'll know you've triggered it if EDI comes over the comm) make final preparations. Order your squad to move into the area and take cover where you want them; this will not trigger the fight. If your squad doesn't move when you order them to (they can sometimes get stuck in the elevated area before the drop down) reload your save and try again until they follow your orders properly. One of the better locations for your squad is in cover near the center of the lower area away from the left wall. This location is best as they will be close enough to the Collectors and husks that will spawn to draw their attention away from you while being far enough from where you'll be fighting the Praetorian not to get hit and killed by its slamming Death Choir attacks.
Along the left wall of the area there is a large, roughly conical pillar with a wide base that twists and tapers towards the ceiling. This is the best place to play ""Ring Around the Rosie"" with the impending Praetorian; there is even a respawning thermal clip nearby that you use use to continually top off your weapons. Once you're ready to begin the fight, advance down towards the pillar hugging the left wall, but don't head for the pillar just yet. First, focus on the advancing husks and the Collector drones that fly in after the husks are dead, and once the Praetorian reaches you, start leading it in circles around the pillar while continuing to focus on the other enemies until they are neutralized. Using a heavy weapon is perfectly acceptable here to make killing the husks and Collectors less of a headache.
Careful not to get caught in the blast; hiding behind cover is no protection
Combat Strategy: Always be aware of where the Praetorian is relative to you, and don't get caught in the open where its eye beams will fry you in seconds; keep cover between it and you at all times. If you must break cover in its field of fire, sprint to minimize damage. Once the other enemies are dead, the Praetorian is the only threat and dealing with it is the same as on Horizon: lead it in circles while chipping away at it patiently with your squad helping. The Praetorian's lethal Death Choir attack triggers when it has taken a significant amount of damage to its armor from weapons fire (not powers) or when it's close to an enemy. Death Choir's shockwave ignores intervening cover, so merely being behind something isn't enough, you also need to be a certain distance away. If you get staggered by the impact of the Praetorian slamming into the ground it might be game over, but you'll still have a small amount of time to scramble away.
Additional Notes:
Fortunately, Harbinger does not spawn from the Collector drones you encounter in this fight, but you should still aim to eliminate them as fast as possible because the Praetorian is constantly flushing you from cover.
While the Praetorian always remains focused on you, the path it takes to chase you can be unpredictable, and there's a risk that it may pass close to where your squadmates are located and kill them with a Death Choir slam. If this happens, do not revive them immediately, or it will simply happen again—wait for the Praetorian to leave the vicinity first.
As always, use Unity if you're damaged or you need your squad back in the fight. A word of caution: while Unity will heal both you and your squad to full health and shields with the right upgrades, the effect isn't instant. If the Praetorian is on your heels and you need medi-gel, make sure to give yourself sufficient lead time and stay on the move.
The need to stay moving while fighting the Praetorian is just one more reason why having Barrier, Geth Shield Boost, or Fortification as a bonus power can pay huge dividends in this mission; if you're running from the Praetorian and your shields are down while facing additional incoming fire from the Collectors you're likely dead unless you can restore your shields immediately, and medi-gel is a limited resource. The Sentinel has the luxury of Tech Armor for such a situation.
As on Horizon, the Praetorian will remain focused on you the whole battle with only two exceptions: activating Tactical Cloak or summoning a Combat Drone at the Praetorian will temporarily distract it, and in the case of cloaking, cause the Praetorian to decide to fry one of your squadmates instead. For this reason an Infiltrator should only use the cloak as a last resort.
Your squadmates will focus all their fire on the Praetorian, so manually order them to target something else if you need to.
It is possible to stop more than a few Husks from spawning if you run to the other side of the room and reach the open door causing it to close. Once it closes, no more enemies can enter from it allowing you to focus on the Praetorian more quickly. This tactic is not recommended unless you are an Infiltrator with Tactical Cloak letting you escape back to cover. An Engineer can also get the door closed sooner by spawning a Combat Drone by an enemy in the doorway. You won't prevent that many enemies from spawning regardless of how you get the door closed so the risk/reward ratio of this tactic makes it of questionable value.
An M-920 Cain shot can do significant damage to the Praetorian at the start of the fight as it spawns without its barrier active, but you must begin charging the shot as soon as possible after you hear EDI over the comm as you must get the shot off before anything can shoot you and interrupt the charging of the shot. This will not kill the Praetorian on higher difficulties and is not really recommended as even a Praetorian with weakened armor still has a powerful barrier so it's still generally better to eliminate the lesser enemies first before trying to take it down. Remember also that the Cain does friendly fire so keep your squad out of the blast zone.
Almost Home Free[]
Once the area is cleared of hostiles, pick up any ammo in the area including the power cells on the lower level if you hadn't already, and move to the door. The door will close as you approach it and EDI will divert you to a longer path around the obstacle.
The hallway has some salvageable Collector Technology (+7500 credits) and across from the Collector Technology is a Control Terminal with a Tech Damage upgrade.
Warning:  Once you go through the next door, the door slams shut behind you, you are unable to go back, and the battle starts. Save your game before you continue.
The next fight can be difficult if you rush in too fast and get overwhelmed, but is relatively easy if you approach it cautiously. The Collectors attack in waves that include everything in their arsenal except another Praetorian (fortunately).
Again, move around because there's too many flanking opportunities here
Combat Strategy: Order your squadmates to take cover on the left side of the area while staying outside the entrance, which doesn't trigger the fight until you move inside. There's one Collector pod on the ground and some raised ridges up against the high ground area. It's a good idea for the whole party to remain in this low ground on the left for most of the fight. Move forward to trigger the first wave and get ready—when the Abominations spawn, they need to be killed quickly with weapons or powers. All other Collectors from this point on will not come down the ramp and should have difficulty firing at your squad if it's positioned well. Harbinger will appear and several Collectors spawn in the first wave, but they stay at a distance on the higher ground. Kill the enemies using weapons or powers by moving forward towards the ramp and then running back to recharge shields. Additional waves can be lured out by moving forward carefully, then running back once enemies start flying in. This strategy takes time, but you can use powers and snipe with accurate weapons from a distance and conserve ammo while minimizing the danger.
Once all the Collectors are eliminated, the final hurdle is a lone Scion who lingers by the passageway leading out of the area. It won't move from this location, so you can even conserve ammo and kill it entirely with powers if you don't mind taking the extra time. Once it is down, search the areas where Collector troops died for any thermal clips they may have dropped.
Warning:  Save your game at this point as you will be unable to save your game until after all the remaining combat in the mission is over.
The final part of this mission involves a gauntlet of about twenty husks. Head down the lengthy hall until you hear Joker over the comm recommending that you pick up the pace which is your cue the husks are about to appear.
Fight the horde, or try and slip past
Combat Strategy: Keep moving so as not to get cornered while you eliminate the Husks. On higher difficulties shoot off their armor and then use force-based abilities such as biotics or Flashbang Grenade to instantly kill unarmored Husks in groups. If worst comes to worst and conventional weapons and powers aren't cutting it, take out a heavy weapon if you have one with good spread and blast away. Another tactic is to retreat all the way back to the last room where you fought the Collectors and take cover behind some of the low walls which will confuse and slow down the Husks.
Alternative Strategy: Although it takes some courage to attempt, you can bypass the Husks entirely by sprinting past them to the shuttle which triggers the escape cutscene. Start running the moment you hear Joker over the comm, then stop to catch your breath as you round the corner, then sprint again to get past the majority of the Husks; if you're quick about this you'll see that most of the Husks aren't really aware of you yet and aren't rushing to the attack. To make this easier, a Soldier can Adrenaline Rush past the Husks, an Infiltrator can Tactical Cloak, and a Vanguard can Charge at a Husk nearest the exit. If playing as an Adept, Sentinel or Engineer, then a few shots with the Avalanche or the Grenade Launcher will clear a path through the bulk of the Husks without a problem.
Once the Husks are thinned out or completely eliminated, the way back to the shuttle is clear. Upon reaching it, a cutscene will play that covers your return to the Normandy and your narrow escape from the fully operational Collector vessel."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Freedom%27s_Progress_(mission),"Prerequisite: Prologue: Awakening
The mission is acquired automatically after your briefing with the Illusive Man.","Your first two henchmen want to let you know you're in charge
Freedom's Progress is the third and final mission in the prologue, where Commander Shepard's embryonic team investigates the recently attacked colony of Freedom's Progress. Your mission is to recover any clues or information as to who is responsible, with help from newfound squadmates Jacob Taylor and Miranda Lawson.
You start in the shuttle, talking with Jacob and Miranda. When Jacob asks for specific orders, there are morality points available: you can get Paragon points for emphasizing looking for survivors, or Renegade points for prioritizing the mission over everything else.
On arrival, be sure to check the Squad menu and assign your available points to powers. Pay attention to the numbers on the sides of buildings for navigation.
Arrival[]
When you gain control you're at a landing pad with the shuttle behind you. You need to go through the big door in the distance, which means going through the building labeled 27 in front of you. Jacob and Miranda both comment on the suddenness of disappearances and the palpable lack of any evidence.
You have two biotics with you, play to their strengths: Miranda for protection stripping, Jacob for immobilizing
Beside the big garage door beneath the floodlights is a pile of lootable spare parts (1000 credits). Beyond the door, there will be two LOKI Mechs in the prefab house across from you, unreachable except for gunfire and powers. Up the stairs to the side are two inactive LOKI mechs that activate on proximity, and a currently locked door. When the first two LOKIs are destroyed the other two activate, and the door opens to reveal two FENRIS Mechs. A few seconds later, another LOKI mech will appear where the first two were. After this encounter you'll gain the Codex entry for mechs.
Combat Strategy: For the first battle of a prologue mission, this can get surprisingly tricky on higher difficulty levels since the LOKI mechs flank the one obvious cover position and the FENRIS mechs approach relentlessly. You'll need to be quite nimble in switching directions and concentrating on the most threatening target. An alternative tactic if you're having trouble is run back through the door as soon as the enemies spawn and take cover in the previous area. There is a large pipe some distance back from the door where you can take cover, and you can place Miranda and Jacob to the right up on a small ledge. Enemies are not able to follow you through the door and you can pick them off at your leisure. Unless you're confident in your skills, don't take on four LOKIs at once by baiting the dormant ones while the first two are still active.
A popular saving spot due to who you'll meet next
When all the mechs are scrapped proceed to the building labeled 75. Inside is a Med Kit with 1 medi-gel (if your medi-gel is full any excess will be converted to 100 credits) and a Wall Safe worth 2000 credits (bypass required). Outside is another pile of spare parts (1000 credits) and another building, labeled 92 on the side. This building is initially locked: it is guarded by one LOKI Mech and one FENRIS mech, both inactive but will go online when you approach. Destroy them both and the building becomes accessible. Note:  Before opening the door, make sure you retrieved everything you need from the environment up to this point as they will be inaccessible afterward.
Inside prefab 92 your squad will run into Tali'Zorah vas Neema and a group of quarians under her command, all of whom express great distrust for Cerberus. Tali explains that their mission is to find Veetor, an unstable and sensitive quarian who came to the colony on Pilgrimage. They suspect that Veetor, nervous to begin with, must have suffered damage to his suit during the attack, with the subsequent infection causing him to become paranoid and reprogram the security mechs.
The two squads decide to work together to find him. Again, multiple morality points are available depending on how you play this encounter out, and if you imported a game from the first Mass Effect where you helped Tali with her Pilgrimage you can even leverage it here.
Battle-hardened Spectre-N7s have no business getting jump-scared by an activating LOKI in a lightless part of the room... unless they do.
When you regain control, the door where you came in will be locked, so there's only one way to proceed: a walkway to the next building (labeled 55). Outside, Tali will warn of security drones, which you will see fly past you, and Jacob thanks her for the heads-up. Inside building 55 one LOKI mech is bundled up next to a Wall Safe worth 2000 credits (bypass required). The time it takes for it to stand up is enough to do significant damage.
Outside building 55's exit you'll see buildings 56 and 57. Two Assault Drones and one Rocket Drone will appear, and three more of the same will replace them after they're destroyed. Jacob helpfully suggests using Overload on them, which at least Miranda has if you don't have it. Tip: If you're replaying and have Stasis it will destroy any drone you use it on.
You'll want to do most of the heavy lifting in combat yourself to keep your new comrades in arms alive to help you with their abilities
The drones can quickly strip your shields and health if you're not careful, so stick to the banisters as much as possible. The first 3 drones take position on the lower rectangular block to the left of building 55, so the obvious cover position is the banisters bounding the walkway. Be careful, as the reinforcements will have a height advantage and possibly negate your banister cover: one Assault Drone perches on the tanks next to building 55 while the Rocket Drone goes on top of building 57. You can take shelter at prefab 56 and lean out of its doorways to fire at these guys. Note:  You can also remain at the exit of building 55 to deal with all of the drones by edging out carefully, leaving both Jacob and Miranda safely inside to assist with powers. However, if you go too far out both of them will suddenly teleport outside and you get locked out of the building.
When the drones are all down Tali will contact you saying that Prazza and the other quarians went on ahead, despite her protests, in an attempt to locate and remove Veetor before Cerberus can question him. In building 56 will be a thermal clip, and a Med Kit. Note:  If the drones dropped thermal clips at their assigned positions there's no legal way to reach those places. You'll have to make do with the ones reachable by walking.
Backtrack to Miranda's position and you'll be largely safe from whatever the drones fire at you wherever they are
Proceed to  building 57, which is empty, then down to three flights of stairs. Shortly before descending the second flight you'll run into two Assault Drones and one Rocket Drone, each with a back-up (same as the previous drone encounter).
The drones initially land on the long blocky level next to the green body of water, in front of you when descending the second set of stairs. However, they periodically switch places between that and two smaller rectangular platforms on the descending ramp to the big (currently disabled) gate. Quickly returning to the top of the staircase gives you the high ground and the best cover for taking out the drones regardless of their placements.
When the last drone explodes Tali urges you to hurry: Veetor reprogrammed a heavy mech that's now laying waste to Prazza and his team, causing Miranda to remark they did want to get to Veetor first. Tali wants you to order your squad to both sides of the large door's entrance and hide yourself at the barricade in front of it.
But first, sweep the area for lootables: thermal clips, if they fell from the drones on accessible places, spare parts (1000 credits) next to the building labeled 2 (which in turn is directly below building 57), a guaranteed thermal clip next to the pile of spare parts, and a Med Kit on the ramp. Note:  This is the last chance to sweep the preceding areas as the garage door will lock once you get in.
Once you're all in position, Tali will open the door remotely then hide.
Cargo Docks[]
That's going to be a hell of a headache
You get in just in time to see a YMIR Mech slaughtering almost the entire quarian team, then its attention turns on you.
The mech is protected by shields and armor, and is equipped with a rocket launcher and machine gun. Limit your exposure to as little as possible - its weapons can incapacitate you within seconds. The YMIR advances on your position and may catch you off-guard by flanking. Most of the time the mech will focus completely on you, leaving its back open for your squadmates; you will be completely safe from both its machine gun and rocket launcher as long as you stay in cover, but you can pop your head up and help your squad out when the mech pauses between switching weapons.
There are a bunch of boxes around: three yellow boxes, one set of white man-height boxes, and a waist-high white box with a barricade. Hide behind the white boxes as they are indestructible, and do not use the yellow boxes for cover as the YMIR will shoot through those. The waist-height white box is indestructible but not optimal as the YMIR will simply look down on you and shoot when it reaches you there, and so it should only be used in a pinch.
PROTIP: ignore the yellow boxes, hide behind the white boxes, and run the mech around in circles until it explodes
One good tactic is to position your squad off to the right or in the doorways of the nearby buildings, then get the mech's attention and simply dance around the white man-height boxes you start behind. The YMIR should only focus on you, allowing your squad to damage it. Keeping large objects interposed between you and the mech as you move shouldn't be a problem given the mech's slow speed, and each time it finishes firing a rocket you have a moment to step out and take some quick shots. Staying on the move without getting fully ""into cover"" will help keep you mobile and avoid splash damage from the rockets.
Alternatively, you can run inside the buildings 25 or 95, because the YMIR can't follow there. Both buildings have low-walled windows where you can take cover behind and shoot. Starting behind your original position, wait for the mech to walk down the ramp and towards you, then run for it. Waiting until the mech walks down the ramp will ensure that you take minimum damage during your sprint for the building, since the mech will have to turn to aim at you. Obviously powers such as Adrenaline Rush, Tactical Cloak, or using Stasis on the mech will all make this easier.
No sense leaving useful items among the wreckage and the dead
Once the mech is destroyed, it's time for the usual item sweep. Building 25 has a Med Kit as well as Tali taking care of the wounded. Building 95 has power cells that increase your heavy weapon ammo supply, a Wall Safe with 3000 credits (bypass required), and a thermal clip. Scan the damaged YMIR Mech below building 79 for a Heavy Weapon Ammo upgrade, and collect the 2000 iridium right next to it. Go up the stairs and into the building Veetor is holed up in.
Finish the mission by entering building 7, right next to building 79. Inside is Veetor, who is babbling in a paranoid manner about monsters out to get him, and watching garbled footage on a wall of display screens. You will have either a Renegade interrupt option, consisting of shooting one of the screens, or a Paragon interrupt, which simply turns them all off with your omni-tool, depending on your first dialogue choice. Both get Veetor to stop muttering to himself, and to finally address you.
Veetor telling Shepard about the Collectors
Tali walks in shortly afterward. Veetor, though delirious, has managed to piece together footage from the colony's security cameras to reveal that the Collectors are behind the abductions. The group theorizes that Veetor was spared because the Collectors are only scanning for human vital signs, or are only interested in humans. Miranda will insist that the quarian be taken into custody for interrogation, but Tali objects, demanding that he be taken back to the Flotilla for medical attention. The final decision rests with Shepard, after which the squad heads back to the Cerberus facility.
Note: In Tali's Loyalty Mission, Veetor has the option to testify on her behalf if he is allowed to return to the Flotilla."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Prologue:_Awakening,"Prerequisite: Prologue: Save Joker
The mission is acquired automatically upon your reawakening.","Reanimation of dead matter: a portion of the Lazarus Project
This is the second mission of the prologue. It begins right after completing Prologue: Save Joker, and it serves a dual purpose, providing a basic combat tutorial and introducing field mission concepts. This mission situates Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect 2 universe as a Cerberus operative with a new team.
After the destruction of the Normandy SR-1 and death of Commander Shepard two years earlier, Shepard's body was recovered by Cerberus, who spent the time rebuilding Shepard into a cybernetically-enhanced symbol of humanity. After the opening credits, which show Shepard literally being rebuilt by the Lazarus Project, and a brief interlude showing Shepard regaining consciousness prematurely, the Commander awakens for the second time on an operating table at the Lazarus Research Station to alarm bells ringing, as the station's personnel come under attack from their own security mechs. Although alone and under-equipped, Shepard is guided by an authoritative female voice over the intercom, the voice belonging to the woman looming over Shepard when they awoke the first time, eventually revealed to be Miranda Lawson, head of the Lazarus Project and commanding officer of the facility.
Escaping the Lazarus station[]
Hey, you. You're finally awake.
You must walk to the locker to obtain a pistol and armor, and then must take cover to avoid damage from an explosion which blows the room's door. This allows you to exit the room and find a spare thermal clip on the floor, just past the door. Walk to the clip to pick it up, and reload your weapon to unlock the door to the next room. If you dither about Miranda grows strident in trying to get you moving, but for the most part there are no consequences for late reactions.
Before proceeding, you can pull up your squad screen and start investing points on your powers. What powers you have depends on your class and whether it's your first playthrough or not (because you can take a bonus power on succeeding playthroughs). This early in the game with starter weapons and armor, you may want to consider boosting your survivability attributes especially on higher difficulties, but as with everything in the game it is up to you since you can reset them later anyway.
If you started from the first Mass Effect and continued to here, you may notice that there is no map for the facility. This is by design for most mission and assignment levels; in fact the only places with maps are the hubs you'll get to visit later. If you do try to bring up the map via the assigned key/button, it will only show you a directional compass to where you need to go next.
When you move on, Miranda's voice will tell you to vault over a low obstacle. A lone Hacked Mech, which arrives from the stairway, will have to be destroyed. Collect more thermal clips from the room if you wish, and then head upstairs.
The mechs may be bent on killing you, but at least they do so in orderly fashion
You arrive at a large well-lit observation room, where Shepard receives a radio warning that several more mechs are coming, and that the safest way to dispose of them is to take cover until they are destroyed. This room has a lot of waist-high cover to lean out of, and the mechs will arrive from the doors right in front of you and to the left. Alternatively
Combat Notes:
If you're playing on a lower level of difficulty the unarmored Hacked Mechs are among the easiest enemies that can be found in the game. It might be a good idea to knock them down with melee attacks and kill them in order to obtain the Brawler achievement early. Legendary Edition:  The Bruiser achievement can be similarly worked toward.
On higher levels of difficulty the mechs advance armored and numerous, so Overload and AI Hacking will help if you have them available.
The mechs only arrive when you take cover. Moving up to the far right corner of the room before taking cover allows you to achieve a better line of fire when the mechs emerge, and any surviving mechs will tend to divert away from you rather than flanking and compromising your position.
Alternatively, take cover near the door leading out and just plow right through the one mech that appears there and keep going (being careful not to get caught in any death explosion). This allows you to skip battling the rest of the mechs.
Rise of the machines
Moving forward after disposing of the mechs, you may witness people being gunned down by a heavy YMIR Mech when you look through a window to the left. Keep moving until you find a new weapon, the M-100 Grenade Launcher, lying next to a dead security officer. Miranda advises Shepard to use this new heavy weapon to dispose of a group of incoming hacked mechs, and indeed you must take the weapon to progress the mission.
Note: The mechs will not appear until you equip the Grenade Launcher. You do not need to actually use the Grenade Launcher, in which case you can keep the 3 Ammo that came with picking it up. However, if at any time you reload the game the Heavy Weapon Ammo drops to 2.
Miranda will then direct you to the elevator, which operates automatically as soon as you step on. You'll then be taught how to storm through a fire obstacle created from the grenade launcher's explosion. The radio communication with Miranda now starts to break up, so you're a bit more on your own.
Straight ahead is a room with two crippled mechs on the ground. These mechs explode on contact with something, be it you or a wall, but otherwise are nonthreatening. Deal with them however you see fit. They are in a room containing laptops where you can access recordings by Miranda and Dr. Wilson about their experience reviving Shepard. There is a wall safe here, which you can bypass to gain 975 credits. This is your first chance to experience the Bypass mini-game, and the Commander has infinite tries to get it right. Legendary Edition:  The wall safe no longer needs to be bypassed and just yields 1,725 credits.
Hapless Cerberus employees blow up left and right throughout the mission
After climbing up some stairs, you'll witness another member of the station's staff being gunned down by a heavy mech. Good thing the glass is shatterproof and the heavy mech just walks away afterward. The public computer next to the window has an audio note from Wilson complaining about Miranda's icy demeanor in less than professional terms.
Entering the next room, you will meet Jacob Taylor on a bridge area, fighting a group of mechs standing on another small bridge at the other side of the room. Dispose of the mechs: help Jacob out, or if you remain idle he'll do it himself (he's invulnerable at this point). Take cover since the mechs will be gunning at you instead of Jacob. Whatever the case, you and Jacob enter conversation afterward.
After the first few mechs are down Jacob observes that things must be dire if Miranda awoke Shepard, and confirms that he is on your side. Depending on your conversation choices, some Morality points may be awarded. Finally, Jacob asks Shepard to help destroy more incoming mechs, promising to answer more questions when that's done. He also indicates that he is a biotic and may use his powers to aid them, should Shepard order it.
Your new guy begins pulling his weight
When you regain control, you gain Jacob as the very first squad member of the game. You must use Pull on a mech here, be it yours or Jacob's, otherwise the enemies will continue to respawn and you will be unable to move on. If you want, you can now pull up your squad screen and invest some points in Jacob's abilities. Tip: During this section Jacob's Pull cooldown is instantaneous, so the mechs can be pulled back-to-back completing the fight very quickly.
When that's done, you and Jacob enter dialogue again and you may obtain more background information on the situation and what happened after the attack on the SSV Normandy two years earlier. When the conversation ends, Jacob receives an incoming call from Dr. Wilson, who is surprised to learn that Shepard is awake and alive. He gives directions to reach him safely.
Before leaving the room, there's a datapad on a bench containing an audio log from Wilson: elation in the project's success, and a seeming obsession with Miranda when considering his previous logs.
[[File:Lazarus Station - come to daddy.png|340px|right|""Gravity's one mean mother, huh?""]
On the path towards Dr. Wilson, Shepard and Jacob encounter additional mechs at what appears to be a boiler room with red lighting, as the path is less secured than planned. A short while after dealing with the mechs there, Wilson comms that the mechs found him in Server Room B and that he's shot. Jacob urges haste, but in reality there's no time pressure.
In a side room along the path, after some stairs up, you'll find another laptop, giving access to another video recording by Miranda explaining Shepard had to be brought back as is without any mental tampering. Proceeding through the next door you'll then meet up with Wilson, who appears to have a wounded leg. You're asked to retrieve medi-gel from a medical station on a nearby wall, then use the Unity power to heal Dr. Wilson, who will then join your squad.
Your next few objectives in one place
Note:  After meeting Wilson, the Squad screen becomes greyed out in the menu and inaccessible for the remainder of the mission. Make sure you spent all the points you need on Shepard and Jacob.
After agreeing where to go next, a group of mechs enter the room and you will be instructed to use Dr. Wilson's Overload ability to clear the explosive crates ahead to be able to proceed. However, if Shepard is an Engineer or a Sentinel, the Commander's own Overload ability can be used if points were invested in it beforehand. Note:  Unlike similar explosive tanks that will be encountered on numerous future missions, these particular tanks cannot be exploded by shooting them. You must use the Overload ability to progress further. Before going on, Jacob feels compelled to reveal to you that the Lazarus Project is a Cerberus operation, with morality points again being awarded depending on your conversation choices.
In the next room heading to the shuttle bay, you will find a datapad on a corpse. The datapad can be hacked for 900 credits. This introduces the Hacking mini-game and again offers unlimited tries to get it right. Legendary Edition:  As with the wall safe before, the datapad no longer has a minigame and can be directly looted for 1,650 credits.
Orange room leads to extra credits, opposite that is the mission exit
Going downstairs and through a corridor, Shepard's squad enters a large docking area, cluttered with crates and more hacked mechs. There are two staircases here, and if you initially head up the left one you will end up fighting ten more mechs, whereas if you head up the right one you will instead fight six more mechs. There are plenty of boxes and walls to take cover on, remember not to die under massed M-4 Shuriken fire.
Either way, once you've cleared the room you should proceed to the upper left part of the area to find a small room with a laptop, which gives access to another log recording: at the beginning of the project Miranda received Shepard's body in a highly damaged state, though Wilson assured her the Commander is still recoverable. Also in the room is another datapad to hack (975 credits) and a wall safe to bypass (900 credits). Legendary Edition:  The wall safe is now the first bypass minigame and yields 2,400 credits while the datapad no longer requires hacking and yields a straight 1,725 credits.
Shuttle departing from Lazarus Research Station
In a small room opposite the upper platform lies the door to the shuttle bay. As Wilson opens the door, Miranda is standing on the other side, and shoots him without ceremony. She explains that Wilson was a traitor, who hacked the security mechs, endangered the project, and cost the lives of most of the staff. You can press Miranda for more information and again receive Paragon or Renegade points during this conversation, at the end of which everyone leaves the station.
Meeting the Illusive Man[]
Chat with Miranda and Jacob a bit before proceeding to the next mission
During the shuttle ride from Lazarus Station to another Cerberus facility, Miranda will ask you to answer questions about the past, to assess Shepard's memory. This is basic background stuff covering your pre-service history, psychological profile, and your reaction to the squadmate who died on Virmire. Jacob finds the exercise unnecessary, and you may stop the conversation at any time by choosing some variant of ""We're done here!"", though again there are morality points here.
If you imported a Mass Effect save file they will ask you about who joined the Council. Whatever you answer will turn out to be true regardless of what choice you actually made. For example, if you chose Captain Anderson to join the Council but to this question you answer Ambassador Udina, Udina will be the Councilor. Legendary Edition:  The Council decision has now been properly recorded in the imported file and Miranda skips this line.
You now arrive at a waiting room in the facility, where you can change armor or casual appearance using a console on the wall, but you will be unable to take any further actions until speaking with the Illusive Man. Don't mind the save files in this level, which says you're still at Lazarus Research Station when in fact you already left.
To this end, enter the communications room, where you don't actually meet face to face with the Cerberus leader himself. The Illusive Man explains over hologram that entire human colonies and thousands of colonists have gone missing. He will ask Shepard to investigate Freedom's Progress, the latest colony to go missing, with the assistance of Miranda and Jacob. You may inquire after further information, and up to 8 Paragon/Renegade points may be awarded, depending on your dialogue choices.
You then return to the waiting area, where it is now possible to talk with Jacob and Miranda for further Paragon/Renegade points. Taking the door out of the entrance will end this mission and start the next one."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Tali:_Treason,"Prerequisite: Dossier: Tali
Some time after recruiting Tali, Kelly will tell Shepard that Tali seems distraught after receiving a message. Shepard learns that Tali has been accused of treason, and that she must return to the Flotilla to defend herself. Tali provides the current location of the Migrant Fleet.","The Rayya[]
""After time adrift among open stars, along tides of light and through shoals of dust, I will return to where I began.""
The Normandy arrives at the Migrant Fleet. There is suspicion because it is a registered Cerberus vessel, but Tali's passphrase allows the ship to proceed to dock with the ship Rayya. Captain Kar'Danna with a marine detail greets Commander Shepard. If Shepard arrived with Legion, they will have their weapons aimed at the squad. Shepard can use Charm or Intimidate to convince Captain Danna to allow Legion aboard. Otherwise, Legion must return to the Normandy and another squad member selected. Captain Danna reveals that the charges are that Tali smuggled active geth into the fleet. On the orders of her father, Admiral Rael'Zorah, Tali had been sending deactivated geth samples to the fleet. When questioned further, Tali insists she took every precaution to ensure the materials were not dangerous.
At the garden plaza where Tali is to be tried, Admiral Shala'Raan greets Tali as ""Tali'Zorah vas Normandy"". Tali hugs the Admiral, calling her ""Auntie Raan,"" and then introduces the Admiral to Shepard as a friend of her father. Tali then reacts to Raan calling her ""vas Normandy""; it turns out Tali has been stripped of her quarian ship's name, something that portends badly for her chances in her upcoming trial. Raan then reminds Tali that she is still entitled to be represented at the hearing by her current ship's captain: Shepard. The Commander's reaction to being Tali's defense lawyer can garner 2 Paragon or Renegade points.
Veetor aboard the Rayya, still nervous around crowds
After the conversation ends, Tali and her new advocate make their way into the crowded hearing chamber. Admiral Raan, forced to recuse herself from judging Tali's guilt or innocence due to their close relationship, opens the proceedings. Shepard may use Charm or Intimidate in two separate dialogue choices to gain morality points. The admirals sandbag Tali with the revelation that the lab ship Alarei has been overrun by geth, demanding an explanation. Tali's father, who was working on board, is presumed dead, but Tali, shocked by the news, refuses to accept this and wants to board the ship to look for him. Shepard and Tali propose to retake the Alarei, which the admirals approve. The hearing is recessed pending the recovery of the Alarei and any data that might reveal what truly happened on it.
For additional story details and occasional morality points, Shepard can talk with the admirals, Veetor, and Kal'Reegar, if he survived Haestrom. The latter two are strongly supportive of Tali and had come to speak publicly on her behalf, but only if two conditions are met: Veetor was not given over to Cerberus, and Kal'Reegar is alive. Shepard learns that the hearing is a facade for the members of the Admiralty Board to advance their own individual agendas; Tali's guilt or innocence is of only secondary importance. Admiral Xen wants to study AI to regain control of the geth; she will be particularly fascinated by Legion if it is present. Admiral Gerrel advocates a war to retake the quarian home world, believing that the quarians have become complacent as a people. Admiral Koris sympathizes with the geth and believes that Tali and her father need to be made examples of to send a larger message about the evils the quarians inflicted upon their ""children"". Admiral Raan alone appears to be acting out of concern for Tali, admitting that she deliberately prevented Tali from being informed about her father's likely death so that her genuine shock at the news during the trial would garner sympathy and make the other admirals more likely to allow her to board the Alarei to find evidence that could exonerate her. Shepard can also return to talk to Captain Danna, but Shepard will not be able to return to the Normandy or request new squad members.
The Alarei[]
Shepard and the team take a shuttle from the Rayya to the Alarei. Shepard enters a room that has two Geth Troopers. They are quickly reinforced by more Geth Troopers and two Geth Hunters. The key here is not to have the ever-advancing cloaked Hunters reach point-blank range where their shotguns are deadly and where low cover will not shield you from them due to their height.
Combat Strategy: Since you have Tali in your party, her AI Hacking ability can be most useful in keeping a  Geth Hunter at bay. In addition to the obvious possibility of using it on a de-shielded Geth Hunter, it can be used on a Geth Troopers standing near a Geth Hunter and will tend to cause the Geth Hunter to become distracted and even move away from you. Since Geth Troopers are much easier to shoot the shields off of than Geth Hunters, this tactic will come in handy repeatedly throughout the entire mission. This battle will be at close quarters with a swarm of geth closing quickly (a preview of things to come): act decisively or you'll be overrun.
In the room is a med-kit with medi-gel, a laptop (+1500 credits), a second laptop (+1800 credits), power cells, and a Quarian Log. The Quarian Log when accessed shows a quarian scientist reporting that something is slowing down the systems, so they're taking down the firewalls as apparently Admiral Rael'Zorah ordered them to bypass standard safeties.
Down the hallway is a medbay. In the medbay is medical station with medi-gel, a hackable Terminal (+4200 credits), and a Repair Drone that Tali had sent to her father. Tali talks about what geth parts she sent to her father and how she did it when you access the Repair Drone.
Continuing down the hallway there is a small office with a hackable Monitor that awards a Geth Shield Strength upgrade. In the hallway between the medbay and the small office is another Quarian Log. The Quarian Log when accessed shows a quarian researcher realizing that geth have infiltrated their computers.
Shepard can continue through the door into the next room but beware as a Geth Hunter comes down the stairs from the rear and right of the room so take the Geth Hunter out quickly.
In this room is a laptop (+1800 credits) and a second laptop (+2100 credits). Near the stairs upwards is a Wall Safe (+4200 credits) that can be bypassed and another Quarian Log that shows a researcher's last moments before being overrun by the geth.
Note:  Save your game at this point before going up the stairs as the next battle will again be close-quarters combat.
You can then go up the stairs into another area that looks like a chemistry laboratory with convenient workbenches for cover.
Combat Strategy: Get in cover behind the nearest table ahead of you, as Geth Troopers and Geth Hunters will come through the doors, in several waves. On higher difficulties there are at least three Hunters and they will all try to close to point blank range with you, leaping right over tables to blast you with their shotguns. Apart from shooting them quickly, you can again resort to Tali's AI Hacking ability to keep them distracted—even if you don't hack the Hunters themselves, they are easily distracted by other geth near them that you hack and will leave off pursuing you. The nature of the cover in this room, along with the additional waves of enemies arriving, means that if you seek cover elsewhere in the room you are likely to be exposed to deadly flanking fire. If a Geth Hunter starts approaching too closely, it's best to flee back down the stairs to the prior room instead. The geth will follow you downstairs and you'll hopefully be able to take them out quickly enough. As always, liberal and precise use of AI Hacking is key to not being overwhelmed.
Warning:  The door in the room downstairs slams shut and you are now stuck in this nasty battle until it is over. If you go downstairs, understand there is not a lot of cover and the Geth Hunters and Geth Troopers will come down the stairs after you. Do as much damage as you can while you retreat down the stairs or you'll be stuck in a small room with lots of geth. After the battle the door magically opens again.
After the battle, inside the chemistry lab there is a crate of Refined Palladium (+2000 palladium) and a med-kit with medi-gel.
The adjacent room will have a Wall Console, which starts a testy conversation with Tali. She is concerned that the risky research on the Alarei was motivated by her father's promise to build her a house on the quarian homeworld. Shepard can advocate taking back the homeworld or suggest giving up on that dream for up to 4 Renegade or Paragon points. There's also a Wall Safe (+3000 credits) that can be bypassed.
Note:  Save your game at this point before opening the door as the next battle will again be close quarters combat.
After going through the door, Shepard will be on the second-floor of a two-level room. Geth Troopers and Geth Hunters will be coming into the room through a door on the lower level. A few Geth Troopers will also come in through a door on the upper floor from the left.
Warning:  The door into the chemistry lab slams shut when you activate the door and you are now stuck in this tough battle until it is over. There is a glitch listed below to help with the door shutting but understand that if the glitch doesn't work that the door isn't open, Shepard and the squad are now in a tiny little room and there are Geth Hunters and Geth Troopers on their way to your location. The geth will close the distance rapidly and won't go to cover until the Hunters are dead. Even after the Hunters are dead sometimes a Geth Trooper will enter the little room. There is almost no cover and the geth outside the little room will shred your squad unless you are very far to the right in the little room. After the battle the door back to the chemistry lab reopens.
Combat Strategy: The ramp up to the upper level makes a natural chokepoint, and a Combat Drone can be used to impede geth progress up the ramp. Sending a Combat Drone inside the downstairs door at the beginning of the battle will usually stop further enemies from spawning. Hacking unshielded geth also works well, and is particularly useful for distracting the deadly Geth Hunters. One thing to be careful about is hacking the Geth Hunters themselves if they are on the ramp, because while attacking the other geth they will often ""back up"" (toward you), leaving you in an extremely delicate position when the hack runs out. It is better in this case to hack one of the nearby lesser geth to distract the Hunter.
Glitch Strategy: There is also a notable glitch here that will make the room much easier on Hardcore or Insanity. Station one of your squad in the chemistry lab and proceed to open the door. If you feel you are overwhelmed, retreat through into the chemistry lab and take cover near a small counter near the door; some of the geth will not enter the lab, and will stand by the doorway; however, this is far from foolproof, since other geth will follow you relentlessly anyway, in which case you should prepare for close-quarters combat.
Exploit Strategy: There is another way of handling this battle that can greatly simplify it, though it's basically an exploit. Immediately charge forward and down the ramp at the geth, and use a heavy weapon with high disruption such as the Avalanche, Arc Projector, Grenade Launcher, or Blackstorm to disable or destroy the geth waiting for you down there. Without pausing, keep going until you reach the door leading out; encountering the dead quarian's body just beyond triggers a cutscene that immediately ends the battle and eliminates all hostiles. Use Unity when needed to keep your health and shields up. An Infiltrator or Vanguard can make it down and out the door even more efficiently by using Tactical Cloak or Charge, respectively.
After the battle, down on the lower level is a med-kit, a laptop (+1800 credits), a second laptop (+2400 credits), and another Quarian Log. Accessing the Quarian Log confirms that it was Admiral Rael'Zorah's intention to take back the homeworld.
Tali spares a moment with her dad
Just beyond the room is Admiral Rael'Zorah's dead body. Tali tries to convince herself that her father isn't dead. Shepard can comfort Tali with a Paragon interrupt or dialogue choices for morality points.
Tali finds a recorded message for her from her father. Rael'Zorah's last words to his daughter are to order her to destroy the main geth hub and to bring the data to Admirals Xen and Gerrel. In the room to the left beside Rael'Zorah is a med-kit, a Wall Safe (+1500 credits) that can be bypassed, a second Wall Safe (+2700 credits) that can be bypassed, and some power cells.
Tip: If you're already full on heavy weapon ammo, you can save the power cells for after the final battle as you'll be able to return here. Also save your game at this point before opening the door at the top of the stairs as the final battle will again be close-quarters combat and the door locks behind you until the fight is done.
Up the stairs from Admiral Rael'Zorah's body is the final battle of the mission: a Geth Prime, a Geth Hunter, and two Geth Troopers. The geth will have their backs turned towards the squad, so Shepard has the element of surprise. In between Shepard and the geth is an unbreakable glass wall. Though the geth can be seen, they cannot be targeted by powers through the glass wall.
The bridge is cramped and offers little cover in the face of these geth so take them all out as fast as you can
Combat Strategy: One very effective tactic is to put your squadmates into cover behind each of the two desks at the entrance. Then, move slightly around the corner and knock down (using powers or your weapons) the shield of one of the smaller geth, and immediately hit it with Tali's AI Hacking power. Most of the geth will immediately begin fighting amongst themselves; when one slips through toward you, usually the Geth Hunter first, then you'll be able to concentrate on just that one with your entire squad.
Meanwhile you can repeat this tactic whenever the hack ends (or a hacked geth is killed) to keep the geth fighting among themselves. Eventually you will be left with just the Geth Prime, and will be able to deal with it without worrying about getting flanked or surrounded -- you can just keep falling back in circles whenever you are too hard-pressed.
Note:  If you have the M-920 Cain while encountering the Geth Prime, you can fire it to the furthest wall to kill all of the geth on the bridge immediately. Shooting any closer may result in your death as well.
Before getting the evidence from the console at the back of the room, Shepard should pick a Quarian Model Ship for the model ship collection, and access a laptop (+3000 credits).
The evidence console contains recordings revealing that Rael'Zorah was deliberately reactivating geth and linking them in neural networks to reach sapience in order to perform weapons tests on them. However, Rael makes it clear that Tali has no knowledge of his criminal activities. Despite the likelihood of this evidence exonerating her, Tali begs Shepard not to reveal it at her trial to preserve her father's name, as his actions violated laws so ""sacred"" to the quarian people that he would be viewed as a traitor for all time.
Once Shepard uses the console the team automatically returns to the Rayya.
Return to the Rayya[]
The verdict against Tali is rendered
Shepard returns to the Rayya to discover that the admirals are about to pronounce Tali dead and deliver judgment in absentia. After the Commander and Tali's entrance prevents this, the admirals ask if they discovered anything on the Alarei. Tali gives her captain a meaningful look and quietly pleads with him one final time. Shepard now has several choices:
Use Charm or Intimidate to point to Tali's history as proof that she would never betray her people. If Shepard took the time to speak to the Admiralty Board before departing to retake the Alarei (and thus uncovered the political debates between the admirals over war with the geth), the speech given will focus more on how Tali's trial is being abused to generate political ammunition. Either way, it will generate 30 of the appropriate morality points and the Admiralty Board will exonerate Tali, granting Shepard her loyalty.
Lie and say no evidence was found, gaining 30 Paragon points. Tali is found guilty of treason and exiled from the Migrant Fleet. She has six hours to leave. However, Tali's loyalty is earned.
Veetor (left) and Reegar (pointing) will argue for you under certain conditionsIf Shepard spoke to the Admirals about their motivations, Veetor and Kal'Reegar are present, and Shepard asked them for their help before leaving for the Alarei, Shepard can rally the crowd. The option is only available if Veetor was returned to the Fleet instead of Cerberus on Freedom's Progress and Kal'Reegar survived Haestrom. They will speak on her behalf and say Tali ""did more for the fleet"" than the admirals ever will. The admirals are cowed and find Tali not guilty. 30 Paragon points will be awarded. Shepard now has Tali's loyalty.
Present the evidence of Tali's father's crimes, earning 30 Renegade points. Tali is declared innocent, but her father faces dramatic consequences. He is posthumously exiled and his name is stricken from the rolls on every ship he served. The Migrant Fleet becomes Balkanized, as the public revelation of the data brings simmering tensions to the forefront. Some ships want to use the research to make new weapons against the geth. Others want to make peace with the geth. Tali is angry at what Shepard has wrought and will not be loyal.
Note that the persuasion dialogue options are only available with a very high morality reputation, so if you have allowed Veetor or Kal'Reegar to die, you may wish to wait until you've done more to raise that reputation score before taking this mission on.
If Tali is found not guilty, Admiral Raan presents Shepard with a tech damage upgrade in thanks.
Note:  At this point Shepard will be offered the opportunity to end the mission immediately, but if you don't leave yet, further conversations can be had with Veetor, Kal'Reegar, Captain Danna, and the admirals, some with more morality rewards depending on how the trial unfolded; see the Morality Guide for details.
If Tali is found not guilty, then after the trial, if Shepard talks to Admiral Han'Gerrel, he will ask what had happened on the Alarei. Shepard and Tali can confide in him about his old friend Rael'Zorah's experiments. He will be shocked to hear this, but promise to keep it a secret. Admiral Daro'Xen will also ask about what happened, but Tali will immediately reply that it's nothing that would help her.
No matter what, upon completion, a new outfit will unlock for Tali. If you talked with the admirals before the trial, you'll get dialogue options in which Shepard can request the admirals move in a particular direction: to attempt to retake their home world by force, or to avoid going to war with the geth at all costs. Regardless of your recommendation, the quarian leaders' replies will be noncommittal. After the trial, Tali retains her changed name, and is listed as ""Tali'Zorah vas Normandy""."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Jack:_Subject_Zero,"Prerequisite: Horizon (mission)
After retrieving Jack from Purgatory, Commander Shepard gives her access to Cerberus's files aboard the Normandy. After the mission on Horizon, Kelly will tell Shepard at some point that Jack wants to see the Commander in her “hidey hole on the Engineering Deck”. Talk to Jack and she wants to blow the facility to pieces; Shepard can comment that attacking allies is a bad idea, but the facility was decommissioned after Jack’s escape.","Travel to the Nubian Expanse, then into the Dakka system to find Pragia.
Arrival on Pragia[]
Teltin facility: unwelcoming?
In the shuttle before the mission Jack will give some dialogue about what happened there, as well as the environment, and the location of where the landing pad is because of it. Jack comments that Cerberus built the place to last. As the shuttle is on final approach to the decommissioned facility, EDI comes over the comm and tells the squad that she is detecting multiple thermal signatures from the complex but none near the landing zone. Time to crash their party.
After the shuttle drops off the squad head around and down into the facility. Upon entering the base proper, Jack will comment about the massive amount of containers and how she doesn’t remember the room from her escape. Hack the terminal on the other side of the room for 3000 credits before moving on. The next room has an active security console that gives some interesting information. Apparently the people at the facility were acting outside the Illusive Man's orders and had gone rogue. Turn off the console and you move on. The next room upon entering appears to be a large room, like an atrium, and Jack comments that she saw sunlight through the skylights. From the way she describes it, it was her first glimpse of sunlight. Head down the stairs and to the right. Easily Missed: Before going under the elevated catwalk, turn to your right and a locked crate will be there that you can bypass for 3000 credits.
Only this landing pad is high enough off the ground not to be completely overgrown
Once you pass under the catwalk be ready for an attack because varren will come around the corner and attack. Take them out before they have a chance to kill you or your squadmates. Combat Notes: Jack's Pull power will disable varren once you have their armor down - note that her Shockwave on the other hand often misses these highly mobile enemies. If you gradually pull back firing as they come on that gives you more time. If one gets right up in your face don't be afraid to melee it - that's often quicker than trying to aim at it running around.
Once the varren are down move to where there is an old bloodstain. Select it to begin a conversation with Jack about what happened. Shepard learns that it was an arena where Jack was pitted against the other kids. Apparently they also drugged her because every time she killed she was rewarded, that continues with warm feelings. In addition, if she hesitated she was shocked. Once you have learned enough move on. The next hallway contains medi-gel, and a security console that when activated will display a security guard telling that the subjects have rioted and that Jack could get out. He goes on to say that all other subjects are expendable but save Jack. Jack turns off the console at that point and you can earn 2 morality points based on your response. Open the door and move down the stairs. The stairs contain a fresh kill and Jack will comment that no one is supposed to be here. Bypass the door on the first landing to get some element zero.
Moving Deeper[]
Entryway to the morgue, Teltin facility
After getting down the stairs and entering the next room, you will suddenly come under attack by vorcha and krogan from the Blood Pack. It's a good idea to put yourself and the squad into cover among the large metal operating tables—but beware as you'll be in close quarters with a Pyro and a krogan. The attackers appear on the upper and ground level ahead of you; take these out quickly or it will be a short fight, and not in the good way. Once all the members of the first wave fall, or even before that, the windows to your left shatter as three more vorcha attack. Switch cover if you need to and let them know the price for ambushing you like that. As usual the Pyro will explode if you can hit him with Incinerate or Overload after his armor is down, and you can use fire-based attacks or Warp to stop the krogan regenerating once his own armor is also down, at which point knocking him off his feet to prevent him from closing or charging is a good idea. The krogan and Pyro are the two most dangerous enemies in the room and should be dealt with immediately.
Combat Strategy: It isn't necessary to get locked into the room to take this fight. Edge into the room carefully and you can trigger the enemies to appear but keep the door from locking behind you, at which point you can then retreat back to the hallway with your squad. Carefully coax the Pyro and the krogan to come through the door one at a time where your squad can annihilate them, then go back inside and methodically pick off the vorcha safely from near the door. Pyros are dangerous around corners so consider using a heavy weapon with splash or spread effects to take it out; the Arc Projector can stun the krogan and bounce to the Pyro, instantly blowing it up.
Warning: Standing outside the room and summoning a Combat Drone inside will trigger the enemies but it will also trigger the door to shut and lock, at which point you can't progress further without reloading a previous save.
Once the room is cleared, Jack will question why this small facility had a morgue, and your other squadmate will comment, provoking a rebuttal from Jack. Head to the other end of the room, to the right, opposite of the now dead ambushing vorcha, and hack a datapad for 3000 credits.
Bypass the door to continue and move down the hall. The catwalk you are on will not have any enemies but when you reach the end and the next door, look down the stairs and, at the bottom, put your squadmates into cover on either side of an open doorway. Run through this door frame and take cover behind the crates. Two vorcha will attack you from the elevated walkway across from you. Take them out (powers work well here) and move down the stairs into a hallway of what appears to be a dormitory or cell block. When you move be careful because more varren will charge from the cell doors to attack you. Tip: If needed, you can retreat back up the stairs as the varren will not follow you. This will allow you to pick them off at a distance. Once they are down move further along and your other (non-Jack) squadmate will comment about the conditions. In the second cell from the end on the right are some circuit boards that you can salvage for 3000 credits. Do so and move on.
Jack listens to a log entry
The next room is large and open, and as you advance on a catwalk Jack will comment with surprise that the facing windows are actually a two-way mirror, and that her cell is on the other side. She will tell about how she would bang on the windows and the other children would not answer her. Before going through the door, grab the medi-gel and then go through. The left room contains nothing of special interest (except for an interrogation chair) but the right has three things of interest. Jack will comment that she must have broken through here on her escape. There are two consoles in the room that will reveal how much the other ""subjects"", for lack of a better term, suffered at the facility. Test subjects were exposed to certain chemicals and apparently freezing temperatures, among other things, in order to develop Jack into the biotic juggernaut she became. Jack refuses to believe that the others had it worse than she did. The other console will show the doctor distraught over the subjects' riot and how Jack may escape, and he'll mention future plans for the project, including a plot to infiltrate the Alliance's Ascension Project. At the end Jack apparently shows up and kills the doctor. Before leaving, hack the research terminal for a biotic amp upgrade. Then move to the door and save your game. Also, be sure to pick up the power cells just to the left of the small corridor leading to the door.
Jack’s Cell Exterior[]
Kureck
A cutscene will play showing a krogan, Kureck, talking over the radio and announcing your arrival to his boss, Aresh. He will ask what to do and his boss apparently says to kill Shepard and the squad; he throws back to Aresh that they need to talk after this. Make sure he doesn’t get the chance.
Combat Notes: The main threat in this battle involves being flanked and flushed from cover while the trio of krogan mercenaries rains rockets and gunfire on you. Staying in cover near the entrance, take out the vorcha on the floor, Pyro first, before they can flank you. Then focus on the krogan in the back, concentrating on one at a time. The krogan will begin sending one of their number at a time down after you, attempting to flank you while the remaining krogan continue their suppressing fire. Whichever krogan leaves the platform becomes the primary threat and you should concentrate on bringing it down at once. When Kureck himself finally comes after you, don't wait around while he closes to point-blank range: as soon as he reaches medium range run to a new cover far away from him. If you keep circling the room he won't be dangerous.
Once Kureck is down Jack says that the only thing left is her cell, and that whoever Aresh is, he is in her cell. Grab whatever ammo may have fallen, and hack the crate for 3000 credits.
Jack’s Cell[]
Once you enter Jack’s cell you begin a conversation with the elusive Aresh. He recognizes Jack and tells her that he, like everyone else at the facility, knew her face, while she hardly knew anybody else. He goes on to tell you that he is restarting the facility because all the experiments must have been for something. So he wants to use the research and find out what they learned. At that point Jack pulls a pistol and threatens to kill him, and you have up to four options available to you.
You can use the Charm option to spare Aresh’s life and Jack lets him go. On the other hand, you can use an Intimidate dialogue option to order Jack to kill him.
Alternatively, or if your reputation's not high enough for the left-hand choices, there are two regular dialogue options ordering Jack either to let Aresh go or to kill him. Taking either will result in corresponding interrupt opportunities: a Paragon interrupt if you order Jack to let Aresh go, or a Renegade one if you order her to kill him.
Let the past die. Blow it up, if you have to.
Whatever you choose, all critical choices have corresponding morality points. When Aresh has been dealt with you can either go or let Jack stay for a few moments.
Staying results in you and Jack walking around the cell and she tells you things about the room and the life she lived at the base. The window, bed, desk, and a bloodstain on the wall outside the cell, all have memories for her and she will elaborate on them. Once you select all four the screen fades to black and you move back to the shuttle.
On the shuttle back to the Normandy Jack fumbles with the trigger for the bomb. She flips the cap on the detonator switch up and down several times, and when Shepard nods in approval she presses the button. Shepard slams a fist on the cockpit door several times to warn the pilot of the coming shockwave, and the bomb goes off. The shuttle is rocked by the explosion but continues on, uninterrupted, to the Normandy.
Normandy[]
If you have already completed Miranda's loyalty mission, when you return to the Normandy, Joker will mention over the PA saying that Jack just went to have a talk with Miranda; when Shepard decides to handle it, Joker replies, “Take pictures.” Once Shepard arrives in Miranda’s office, Jack flings a chair across the room and Shepard tells them both to knock it off. Jack is furious that Miranda will not admit that what Cerberus did to her was wrong. Unless you have enough Paragon or Renegade points you cannot end this situation without alienating either crewmember (fewer Renegade than Paragon points are required). If you do have enough, then you can retain the loyalty of both crew members and can continue any relationships that you have started. If you fail then you will lose out on any relationships with either one, depending on who you alienate. You will also lose the loyalty of the crewmate you alienated. Loyalty can be regained in a later conversation with that crewmate, provided you have a high Paragon or Renegade score.
This conversation can also take place after Miranda's loyalty mission if you completed Jack's before hers.
See also: Loyalty#Confrontations
The amount of Paragon/Renegade points required also varies during the course of the game, due to how Mass Effect 2's Charm/Intimidate system works. You need a high percentage of the total Paragon or Renegade points obtainable from the missions you've undertaken and the conversations available to you on the Normandy and various hub locations in order to pass the persuasion check; the amount of the meter that is filled in does not provide an accurate indication of whether Charm or Intimidate will be possible.
Email[]
Soon after returning to the Normandy, Cerberus Intel sends Shepard an email:
Pragia Facility UpdateFrom: Cerberus Intel

Commander Shepard,

Contacting you per Illusive Man's instructions. He believed you would want to know that he had ordered Subject Zero's project shut down before the riot broke out. Cerberus personnel arrived to find all guards dead, along with most of the subjects. Any surviving children were treated for injuries, given mild amnesic treatments, and delivered to Alliance facilities as survivors of slaver attacks.  A few surviving doctors were forcibly retired for their role in the project.

Per your report, the facility on Pragia has been destroyed.
Mass Effect 3 Consequences[]
If you can convince Jack to spare Aresh, Shepard will receive a news alert in Mass Effect 3 stating that he saved a shuttle of children evacuating a Reaper-occupied colony, dying in the process. His last name is revealed to be Aghdashloo.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Kasumi:_Stealing_Memory,"Prerequisite: Dossier: The Master Thief
This mission is acquired after recruiting Kasumi on the Citadel. Like Zaeed: The Price of Revenge, this mission doesn't require the mission on Horizon to be completed first.
Head to Bekenstein in the Boltzmann system of the Serpent Nebula cluster to begin.","Traveling to the Party[]
Kasumi briefs Shepard on the mission.
Only Shepard and Kasumi take part in this mission. On the ride over you can ask about your cover—either Solomon or Alison Gunn, depending on Shepard's gender—and your new formal attire (which becomes a casual outfit option following this mission). Kasumi will go over the plan and every detail of it. In a nutshell: you will be going to a party at Hock's house, which will feature some of the biggest scumbags in the galaxy. You and Kasumi will break into Hock's vault and grab the graybox of Kasumi's deceased partner and lover, Keiji, which literally contains a snapshot of his brain. You will bring in a tribute in the form of a statue of Saren, which actually conceals your weapons and armor. Once inside you will arm up, break into the vault, obtain the graybox and leave Hock's complex.
At the Party[]
When you arrive at the entrance to the party, one of the Eclipse guards takes some issue with your gift and begins scanning it, which brings Hock out. Respond in any way you wish, then the guard turns up nothing and Hock lets you proceed in but insists that your friend (Kasumi) must stay outside, because Hock doesn’t like the way she looks. Respond to that and Kasumi will pull you aside and is understanding of why she must wait outside. Then Kasumi activates her cloak and heads inside with you.
Kasumi and Shepard arrive at the party.
When you are inside move through the party and enjoy yourself while you can. While walking around the party, guests will comment on various missions that you have or haven't completed yet. If Zaeed's loyalty mission was previously done then some party guests will comment on either Vido Santiago's escape or death.
When you reach the end of the corridor off to the left is a security office that Kasumi says you will need to get access to eventually. Then she reminds you about the vault so move on. Hock is currently unavailable for talking at the moment so move out onto the deck and read a datapad. Apparently there is a Chief Roe in charge and Kasumi says that if you can get into the guards' communications it would help. See below.
Heading back inside there is a door that leads to Hock private quarters and is guarded by a merc, Samuels. You can’t get in yet so move to the vault on the lower level.
Getting Into the Vault[]
When you get close to the door, Kasumi decloaks and examines the vault door. After examining it closely, she says that three things are needed: cut the power to the kinetic barrier, get samples of Hock's DNA from his private quarters for the DNA scanner, and record a voice sampling so Kasumi can reconstruct the password using a programmed version of Hock's voice.
Voice Lock[]
Kasumi records Hock's bloviating monologue.
Go talk to Hock; follow Kasumi's advice and keep him talking. Use the Paragon or Renegade options to draw Hock into giving a speech, giving Kasumi plenty of material. If you don't have enough morality points, you will have to use the correct dialogue options to keep him talking long enough to get a sample. Head to the security office and Kasumi will decloak, bypass the lock and take out the two Eclipse mercs in the room. Once they fall, Kasumi will say to look around. Access the Wall Safe (+7200 credits) and the medical station next to it for medi-gel. On the other side of the room is a Datapad with the password for the lock. You can now bypass the voice scanner.
DNA[]
Hock's Apartment - watch for alarms!
To obtain Hock's DNA you need to get into his private rooms. You have two options for this; one involves subterfuge, and the other, brute force.
The subtle method requires convincing the guard (Samuels) outside Hock's quarters to let you in. Before he will allow you access, he will want to verify your access with the head of Hock's private security team (Chief Roe). You will need to enter the Security Room (left of where Hock is standing), take out two Eclipse guards, and read the datapad on the desk. The datapad has the password (""Peruggia""), and after reading it, Kasumi will say she has tapped into the guards' communications. While you're at it, access the Wall Safe and medical station nearby.
Before returning to speak with the guard, walk onto the balcony. There is a Datapad next to a couple sitting on the railing on the side opposite Hock's quarters. It contains a message from Samuels declining some sort of invitation to sneak away from the party. After this, Kasumi will radio and prompt you to speak with the guard again, urging you to tell him Roe sent you. Then, when talking to Samuels, say you have clearance and he will call Chief Roe. Kasumi will tap into the conversation, pretending to be the security chief, and provide you access. Head down the stairs and into the bedroom. If you didn't examine the datapad on the terrace, then the dialogue option for verification with Chief Roe will not appear.
Also, if you did examine the datapad, but didn't raid the security office yet, the option to ask Samuels to check with Chief Roe will be available, but it won't work as the real Roe answers Samuels and tells him she's never heard of you. However, failing in this way doesn't preclude you from trying again after you raid the office and Kasumi taps into the merc comms, you just have to be a little insistent with Samuels and Kasumi pretends to be an annoyed Roe who tells Samuels to let you in and to stop bothering her.
A trio of bored guards by the brute force route
The brute force option is to break into the bedroom from the balcony outside. Head outside and towards the right side nearest the bedroom (the opposite side of the balcony where Chief Roe's datapad is found). There will be a prompt, ""Balcony Railing"", where you can jump down. When you land Kasumi decloaks and now you have to fight three Eclipse guards that are outside the building. There is little cover so use your pistol and powers to take out the guards.
The guards are facing away from you and will not initially turn. You can get as far as the window ledge, but as soon as you shoot or smash the window, they will be alerted. You must eliminate the guards to proceed, you can't climb through the broken window into Hock's quarters until they are dealt with.
If you sneak up (i.e., just walk) to the guard furthest from the window and hit him with melee from behind, it is likely he will fall screaming off the cliff and be instantly killed.
When they are down, head up the fallen panel and onto the ledge. Shoot out the window and head inside. Be warned that because you snuck in, if you activate the alarm clock in Hock's bedroom it will summon two more guards. Note:  To get all the credits, first head to the security office and go either way you choose because both will be available. Kasumi recommends the quick and quiet approach, and that's good advice.
There are a lot of scannable items in Hock's bedroom. There are multiple copies of some things (namely the couches and plants) but each type of item can only be scanned once. Note that you can't scan again until Kasumi or you are done commenting on the previous scan.
Couches: 1 credit chit
Wineglass: DNA
Ashtray: Nothing
Plants: Nothing
Papers: Gives details on how Hock has been trying to crack graybox, he hasn’t yet.
Bypass the Wall Safe (+7800 credits) (Warning: failing the bypass summons the guards)
Antique weapons set: DNA (Kasumi says it may be contaminated, but it will count)
Keyboard: Nothing
Datapad: DNA
Alarm Clock: Wakeup call, which will summon guards to attack you if you broke in through the window.
Pillow: Nothing
When you have enough, Kasumi will say when. Leave and head back up. If you snuck in through the balcony, and didn't activate the alarm clock during your search, you will have to fight two guards on the way out. If you are able to knock one out a window, he will fall out screaming.
Lights Out[]
The barrier power coils are along the floor to the right when you exit the vault. Kasumi will reset your omni-tool to scan for the power source. Head up the stairs ahead and around until you reach the fireplace. Pull the statue on the wall and that will disable the barrier.
When you have completed all three tasks head back to the vault and bypass the security systems.
Note:  You will now have your first opportunity of the mission to select your weapons loadout.
The Vault[]
Donovan Hock's vault with various objects, including the head of the Statue of Liberty
Kasumi will disable the security while Shepard straps on armor and both grab weapons. As you emerge into the vault Kasumi will trace the signal from the box and you can admire some of the works. Among them are Michelangelo's David, a krogan statue, a rachni queen statue, a turian sculpture, a statue of a Creature, a scale statue of the Kara (known as 'the turian Titanic'), some old quarian stone tablets, an ancient Egyptian statue, a Prothean statue, and the head of the Statue of Liberty.
After examining the Statue of Liberty's Head, there is a Codex entry which details how it got detached in the first place. The Michelangelo's David sculpture found in Hock's vault appears to be a little worse for wear in certain areas, missing a leg and a few other... bits and pieces. In the inaccessible area of Hock's art gallery behind Liberty's head, there appear two pieces of art that resemble miniature mass relays similar to the mass relay monument found in the Citadel's Presidium.
Hock, the great and powerful
On the table with the graybox are a pair of M-12 Locust submachine guns. Grab the graybox to progress, Kasumi starts to crack it and a holographic head of Hock threatens the two of you. Use a Renegade interrupt to shut Hock up while Kasumi cracks the graybox. Now Hock calls on his guards to attack. Chief Roe is among them. Use the cover and take them out, but be careful, as Roe's Eclipse troopers will try to flank you and they also throw Flashbang Grenades that can blind, damage, and stun you, while Roe herself attacks with Combat Drones and Incinerate.
Combat Strategy: Approaching this fight conventionally can be very risky due to the number of enemies pinning you down and the danger of being stunned out of cover by drones, Incinerates, and grenades, but it's doable. Slightly to the left of the initial starting cover is one of the best places to be for the whole battle (the krogan statue on the pedestal will be to your right). Chief Roe will stay in cover launching Incinerate bolts and Combat Drones towards you but the Combat Drones get stuck on the wall in front of you and aren't able to land their attacks while you remain in cover; time your shots in between the drone attacks to eliminate them, or use Kasumi's Overload if necessary. Some of the remaining mercs move around erratically but will also take cover eventually. Kasumi can draw some fire and give Shepard a chance to pop out from cover to attack but she has a tendency to die on higher difficulty levels; thus, an effective way to both eliminate enemies and keep Kasumi alive is to have her use her Shadow Strike power constantly as it grants her temporary invulnerability and she can return from delivering the attack with full shields again, though you will have to get used to manually ordering her to take cover again after each strike. Even if she can't kill the target in one blow she will do substantial damage and often stun it. This level contains quite a lot of medi-gel including a dispenser in this very room, so if she goes down while the enemies are still numerous go ahead and revive her. Kasumi will come back to life after the battle so no need to waste medi-gel if you're down to the last couple enemies.
Alternative Strategy: An effective way to make this fight much easier is unleash a heavy weapon right at the start while the enemies are all packed together in the bottleneck of the doorway. The best weapons for this strategy are either the M-622 Avalanche or the M-100 Grenade Launcher as their shots stagger enemies, and in the case of the Avalanche freeze them solid for a long time if they get hit without shields or armor. Having Kasumi hit them all with an Overload as they are all clustered in the doorway can soften up shielded enemies and overheat the weapons of unshielded ones making your life even easier. Roe possesses armor and is the hardest to bring down but if you take out the majority of the other enemies with heavy weapon fire she's much easier to handle.
Getting Out[]
Head toward the door that the mercs came out of, be sure to grab medi-gel from the medical station to the left of the door before you walk through the door. After you exit the room, you can change out your arsenal at a weapons locker on the left.
Combat Tip: Before you access the door into the next section, keep in mind that accessing weapons lockers completely refills conventional ammo for all weapons. Make sure to access the weapons locker now before the upcoming battle to refill your ammo for free as the locker becomes unavailable after starting the next encounter.
Go through the next door and quickly take cover, because you will come under attack almost instantly from more Eclipse Troopers and an YMIR Mech. Take out the first two Eclipse Troopers then hop into cover, the YMIR will not enter your part of the garage, so you can sit back and take it down at your leisure. Once the YMIR falls, move up and take out the remaining mercs, which can include an Eclipse Engineer and an Eclipse Vanguard. Once you get far enough down the driveways, Hock will seal you in, so head up the stairs to the right and through the door. Hack the PDA (+4200 credits) on a container before you leave.
Note:  The weapons locker becomes usable again after you clear out all of the enemies in the area, and you either save your game and reload it, or you move far enough into the room to hear Hock's voice line about sealing you in. This can be a handy way of refilling your thermal clips.
At the other end of this hallway are eight more YMIR Mechs in storage, though thankfully none will activate. Move up to the next door and take cover, because there are more Eclipse Troopers and an Eclipse Heavy in this room. This room holds even more YMIR Mechs in storage and several missiles that will keep traveling overhead. Eventually you reach a point where you need to blow some tanks, but Eclipse Troopers and some LOKI Mechs won’t make it easy. Take the mercs down before approaching the parked M-080's mass accelerator weapon.
Combat Tips: If you get into trouble, firing the cannon will instantly kill almost every enemy in the room.
Using Adrenaline Rush, Tactical Cloak, or Tech Armor you could run past the some of the enemies and trigger the cannon to wipe them all out. Very useful on higher difficulties, though rushing past all the enemies at once is only recommended with Tactical Cloak - others should winnow the pack a bit first.
If you are an Engineer, you can place Kasumi into cover close to the tanks, drop a Combat Drone, and then make a run for the cannon as the door is opening. They should draw enough fire, even on Insanity to make it to the cannon and wipe out the back-up units.
Some Heavy Weapons and the M-98 Widow are also powerful enough to take out the tanks.
Nothing is true, everything is permitted - Kasumi about to off someone stealthily
Before you activate the M-080's mass accelerator weapon (if you didn't use it during the battle), there are several items to collect in this area. Near the M-080's cannon is a crate of Refined Platinum (+1000 platinum), salvageable Spare Parts (+4800 credits) and a med-kit with medi-gel. In the LOKI mech room next to the explosive tanks is another salvageable Spare Parts (+1200 credits).
When you're ready, activate the M-080's mass accelerator weapon to explode the tanks. Hock doesn’t sound too happy over the intercom as you move through the hole in the wall.
Warning:  When you drop down into the next area you are unable to go backwards. Save before you drop down into the next section.
When you drop down through the hole in the wall turn right and take cover. More Eclipse Troopers, an Eclipse Heavy, and another YMIR Mech will be coming down on the attack, so use cover and take them all out.
Combat Tip: The YMIR will be unable to advance on your position much like your prior encounter with one. Staying on that small crate cover next to the door you dropped down from looking down the long hallway and you can eliminate all of the mercs and the YMIR with ease, or move to the left behind the truck and you'll be out of the YMIR's line of fire entirely.
When the mercs are all down, move up, but take note of the cover as a truck will pull up with two more Eclipse Troopers, an Eclipse Vanguard, and an Eclipse Heavy on it. Move as you need to in order to take them out. Note:  Use of an Engineer's Combat Drone in the prior segment of the battle may induce them to move forward and join the fray early.
Once they are down, head for the door. You'll find a Tech Damage research upgrade on a Dead Merc to the left of the door and a med-kit with medi-gel to the right of the door.
Warning:  When you enter the door into the next area the door will slam shut behind you and you are unable to go backwards. Save before you open the door into the next section.
As you enter the next room, Hock will tell his forces to keep you busy, as he will handle the situation himself. You will encounter Eclipse Troopers, an Eclipse Vanguard, and an Eclipse Heavy in here, so watch your step. You and Kasumi should both take refuge inside the large shipping container to the left after entering the room, as it gives you excellent protection from all enemies while still allowing you to stand. As you eliminate enemies, more mercs will arrive including an Eclipse Engineer and another Heavy. An additional Eclipse Vanguard sometimes spawns after the Engineer if you advance too slowly. Keep a close eye on any Vanguards as they sometimes approach your position.
Combat Tip: It's possible to prevent additional waves of enemies from spawning by having Kasumi or yourself in an advanced position closer to the exit door before killing the last enemies in the initial group. An active Combat Drone in a forward position can also accomplish this.
When you take out all the mercs, there are several items to collect in this area. You'll find some salvageable Spare Parts (+1800 credits), two crates of Refined Platinum (+500 platinum each, +1000 platinum total), a PDA (+1800 credits) on a truck, and a Storage Crate (+1200 credits). When you have everything, save your game before you head for the door.
Landing Platform[]
A cutscene plays showing Shepard and Kasumi exiting onto the landing platform. They are suddenly met with a hail of bullets as Hock appears in a fully armored A-61 Mantis Gunship with additional shielding. As they take cover they are met with a wave of mercs and LOKI mechs.
Don't remain at your start position (A); instead, hunker down at (B) while Kasumi can hold at (C) or (D)
Combat Strategy: This is probably the most challenging fight in Kasumi's loyalty mission, as you will be attacked by mercs, LOKI mechs, and a gunship all at once. It is not a good idea for you and Kasumi to take cover where you begin the fight in the center of the landing platform, as enemy waves can spawn on your left or right and potentially flank you from either direction. Most critically, the crates in the middle area where you start do not offer reliable protection against the rockets fired by the gunship, and getting hit by said rockets staggers you out of cover and is usually a death sentence at higher difficulties. The optimal cover position for this fight is actually to the left of where you start. Here there are some crates near the rear wall that have respawning thermal clips on them making ammo not an issue for the fight. This left area is also much better cover against flanking attacks as well as the gunship. Kasumi is also afforded better protection in this area, as you can have her hold position against the high cover that is directly in front of your position, or behind the crates close to the leftmost edge of the area, whichever you feel works best. Kasumi should not remain by your side, as this can lead to both of you being hit by rockets.
Combat Tips:
The merc/mech waves arrive via three elevators: one to the left, one to the right, and one at the far edge of the area slightly to the left. Kasumi will usually issue a verbal warning when a wave is incoming and from what direction. Another helpful cue: a klaxon will sound and red warning lights will flash right above the elevator where enemies are about to arrive from. The first wave always arrives from the right side elevator.
Keep in mind that the gunship has two modes of fire: continuous machine gun/cannon, and two rockets in rapid succession. The rockets travel deceptively fast, deal high damage, and stun you out of cover so seeing them coming in time to take cover is a high priority.
There will be 1-2 LOKI mechs with many waves. Prioritize disabling and killing them over the other enemies as they will otherwise approach to point-blank range. On higher difficulties they also possess armor.
The ultimate goal of the first section of this battle is to reduce the shield on Hock's gunship to the point that he will have to retreat and recharge it, so once you've thinned out the mercs a bit start whittling the gunship down. This will reduce the amount of time you have to wait before Kasumi tells you she can disable its shields permanently.
Once the gunship returns with full shields, concentrate all of your effort on the mercs until Kasumi eliminates the gunship's shield, allowing you to begin working on its armor.
Kasumi vs. Gunship
You will eventually be treated to a cutscene where Kasumi pulls off some amazing acrobatics and disables the gunship's shields.
There are two ways to get to the point the cutscene triggers where Kasumi takes down the shields on the gunship. There is a set dialogue string from Hock that you can let play out as you fight off recurring waves of guards, or you can skip some waves by taking down the shields yourself once, and allow Hock to re-appear with the shields recharged. Either way will lead to the cutscene and eventual final showdown. It also doesn't seem to matter that Kasumi might be down at this time, she will miraculously come back to life and perform her astonishing gymnastics, so save your medi-gel if you are close to this point. If Kasumi informs you she needs ""a clear path to the gunship"", it means that you must eliminate the remaining guards before she can disable the shield: do so as soon as possible or Hock may manage another shield recharge.
Following the cutscene, you will be returned to the original position from which you started the battle, regardless of where you moved during the battle, so if you prefer the cover to the left you will need to get over there once again. Meanwhile, Hock's gunship will now be like any other gunship that Shepard has encountered and can be killed. Keep chipping away at its armor until it is destroyed, although the priority is still any mercs or mechs on the ground that might flank you or drive you out of cover. The main challenge here is keeping the mercs safely under control while still finding time to chip away at the gunship, but remember you will have at least a brief window to line up shots on the gunship at the end of each wave, so if you're having trouble play it safe.
Note:  It is not possible to fight fewer than three waves of enemies in this encounter, as the gunship's shields can only be disabled after the second wave is killed at the earliest. If you want to minimize the enemies you have to fight the key appears to be not clearing the enemy waves too fast; leave each wave with at least two enemies alive for a respectable amount of time before killing them off. Leave the first wave with at least two alive until you work down the gunship's shields, leave the second wave with at least two alive until Kasumi delivers her line about disabling the shields and until Hock taunts you, and leave the third wave with at least two alive until you can wear down the gunship's armor and destroy it. Killing too much of a wave or killing it too fast will either cause a new wave to immediately spawn, or it will cause the gunship to fly away and hide until the current wave is cleared out and a new wave spawns.
When the gunship is finally destroyed (along with Hock), Shepard's shuttle will arrive on the other side of the landing platform. Before entering the shuttle, be sure to scout around as there are three med-kits with medi-gel and a medical station near the entry door with even more. There are also some power cells next to the staircase leading up to the shuttle. Once you're ready to leave move up to the shuttle to leave the mission.
Shuttle Ride Back[]
Keiji's highly incriminating memories
The shuttle will touch down and on the ride back Kasumi will examine the graybox and be treated to memories of her time with Keiji, as well as a warning: if the information in his graybox were made public, the consequences for the Alliance could be severe. Images of what appear to be Reapers are seen in the first and third frames, interspersed within personal memories.
Kasumi has trouble letting go, and the scenes behind her show that their relationship was much more than professional. After the scene is over, you can persuade Kasumi to keep or destroy the box, with additional morality points available depending on your level of tact. Regardless of your decision, Kasumi will be loyal to you."

Kasumi Goto

- Master of stealth and infiltration
- Skilled hacker and information specialist
- Operates completely off the grid
- No criminal record

Kasumi Goto is not the most famous thief in the galaxy -- she's the best. Trained in the arts of stealth and infiltration, she has ""acquired"" artifacts and information from all over the galaxy and yet maintains a completely clean criminal record. She is awaiting rendezvous with Shepard on the Citadel, in the Zakera Ward.","Look for the advertisement tube showing Kasumi's face
Kasumi's ad terminal isn't hard to find, it is right there when you leave the Normandy at the Level 27 Dock. Select the terminal and you begin a conversation with Kasumi, she is talking through the terminal and transmitting from the platforms and catwalks above the dock.
If you loiter by the terminal without accessing it, she recites different advertisements containing less-than-subtle references to her recruitment. If left alone long enough, she becomes annoyed and openly questions Shepard as to why she is being ignored.
Note: The password ""Silence is golden"" is not necessary for her acquisition. Telling her to ""cut the crap"" will not penalize you in any way.
Kasumi's recruitment is completed simply by welcoming her aboard, but she requires your assistance on a job regardless of your interest in the matter. Learn more about her and the context of the job by fully exploring her dialogue options instead.
You can ask about whether she has been briefed, what is with the secrecy and her history with Cerberus. Apparently Cerberus made a deal with her and when asked she gives the history of what happened and the briefing for the heist.
The Master Thief knows where you are
You can also ask what happened and about Donovan Hock and the plan. Apparently she has procured some evening wear for Shepard. You can ask about grayboxes and their function as well. When you have all the information you need, welcome her aboard.
When you end the conversation, the terminal sinks into the ground, and Kasumi begins talking to Shepard in person from the catwalks. As she walks away, she cloaks.
You can find Kasumi in the port observation lounge on the crew deck of the Normandy.
Note:  This mission is unlike normal recruitment missions in that once completed it doesn't move forward squadmate conversations or trigger loyalty missions.

Dr. Mordin Solus

- Biological weapons expert
- Light weapons training with Salarian Special Tasks Group

Dr. Mordin Solus is a salarian biological weapons expert whose technology may hold the key to countering Collector attacks. He is currently operating a medical clinic in the slums of Omega.","Arrival on Omega[]
Aria always liked Mordin
When Shepard arrives on Omega, EDI cautions that the section housing Mordin's clinic is quarantined due to a plague outbreak, and that gaining access may be difficult. While she advises visiting Afterlife to get more information, it is possible to head directly to the quarantined area near the apartments and start the mission. If you choose to stop by the club, you need not proceed there immediately if you wish to explore, since there are several minor assignments available in the area, as well as a few merchants.
At Afterlife, the bouncers wave you through immediately, while a human is fruitlessly antagonizing the elcor bouncer about the long wait. In the entrance hall you can earn some morality points depending on your dealing with some batarian thugs. Once inside the main bar, you can head to the back and up the stairs to the platform where Aria T'Loak, the de facto ruler of Omega, sits watching over her domain. You can ask her about anything to do with Omega, but be sure to eventually ask about Mordin and Archangel. Once you get the information, you can excuse yourself from the club. Eventually make your way to the turian guarding the shuttle dock to the quarantine sector.
Into The Plague[]
The quarantine guard uses hand gestures to accentuate his desire for the human to get lost
Before speaking with the turian, you may wish to save in case you do not have enough morality points to get past him without having to shoot up the place. As you approach, a human woman is incensed at the turian, as she is not being allowed back into the slums to protect her possessions from looters.
Asking about the plague reveals that it affects everyone but humans and the vorcha. You can use the morality options to get the guard to call ahead and tell the other guards to stand down. Alternatively, if you want a firefight, then use the right dialogue options. If you get past the turian using diplomacy, the human woman will exasperatedly ask why she can't also be let in, and the turian will point out she is distinctly lacking a grenade launcher.
The Slums of Omega[]
Upon entering the slums and depending on your options with the turian guard, either you will be shot at or the guards will stand down. Either way, first move straight across to retrieve the crate of 250 refined eezo. Then go back a little, turn toward and go around the barrier; be sure to pick up the medi-gel on your way. Open the only door and go down the stairs where you'll confront a couple of Blue Suns mercs, and be prepared for some grizzly conversation from your squadmates. From where you enter run across to get access to a terminal with 5,000 credits; there are power cells in the nearby room, in which you can bypass a door to get access to 4 audio logs describing how some turians were sealed in by the local Blue Suns mercs to prevent the spread of the plague. The logs describe their final, tragic days.
The batarian plague victim is less than pleased to see humans
Go back out and to the batarian victim on the ground. He is not happy to see humans since humans are not affected by the plague, from which fact he has convinced himself that humans are the cause of the plague. Ask him some questions and eventually he will go into a coughing fit, whereupon a Paragon interrupt will use one of your medi-gel to help him (+5 Paragon points). An additional 2 Paragon points can be earned after the Paragon interrupt by saying, ""I'm here to help,"" or 2 Renegade points can be earned by saying ""I need information"" or by simply ignoring the interrupt and letting him die. He does indeed have a lot more information he can give you, so if you save him you can ask about the professor, particularly his rather unorthodox methods and skill with weapons. Apparently the Blue Suns pressed him for protection money, and he popped them all before they could even respond. When you get to the clinic, ask Mordin to send someone to escort him back to the clinic as this will net you some experience points. There is no journal entry associated with this, however.
The entrance to Kokomo Plaza; a merc is seen right of center, standing behind the main barricade
Moving past the now healthier or dead batarian, bypass the nearby door and go down to discover another batarian; unfortunately there is nothing you can do for this one. Access his logs to find out what happened to him, and you can loot his wall safe for a sum of 4,000 credits. Go back upstairs through the door, head to the right, and you enter the beginning of what is apparently called Kokomo Plaza, where you will soon come under fire from several Blue Suns mercs. You can fight them from the first floor, or you can run up the stairs (on the left) and take them out from the height of the second floor. If you're an Engineer, be sure to send your Combat Drone over early, as it will prevent the appearance of more enemies, shortening the fight significantly. If you're feeling particularly aggressive, running quickly around the right side and then forward will get you to a position flanking the enemies at point blank range—which also prevents the spawning of any more enemies and lets you overload the many explosive containers just behind them.
After taking them out, if you did not go to the second floor, retrieve the medi-gel and spare parts (1,000 credits) located there. On the opposite side of the plaza from where you entered, to the right of the barricade, bypass a door and enter the apartment of two human refugees. They tell you about how the Blue Suns, even though corrupt, still ran a tight ship and had reasonable rates, at least for Omega. You can persuade them by using moral speech that staying in their apartment is not the best idea, but they will not come with you. They say if you can clear a way to Mordin's clinic, then they may take their chances and go to the clinic. Any way you decide to take the conversation don't forget to access the safe for 4,000 credits; there is also a medical kit on their kitchen table.
A Blue Suns trooper considers the ramifications of exposing himself
Go behind the main barricade of the plaza (where you destroyed the Blue Suns) and scan the dead merc for an assault rifle upgrade. It is recommended that you save the game at this point: the next area is hard, especially on higher difficulty levels. Go down the stairs and through a door, entering the remainder of Kokomo Plaza, and you start hearing gunfire. Apparently the Blood Pack is moving in on Blue Suns territory. Using the ongoing battle as a distraction, backtrack and go up the stairs. Position your squad quickly because the Blue Sun mercs won't last very long, and then the pack will turn on you (note that the Blue Suns can also attack you). Use your elevated position for an advantage, and have someone guarding the stairs. The vorcha will stay at a distance, but the Blood Pack's varren and krogan will not stay away but rather will charge up the stairs. Destroy the Blood Pack, watch for the Pyros, and then move down the stairs.
Combat Tips: Manually ordering your squad up the stairs will prevent them from knocking out the Blue Suns too soon, which will in turn make your early battle with the Blood Pack easier—varren are easier to pick off when they're trying to eat somebody else. The two Pyros hiding behind the central pillar can be safely sniped early on from upstairs if you move to the far left and right ends of the window and shoot their flame tanks. The two krogan usually appear one at a time in the middle of the battle, and you should concentrate fire and powers from your whole squad when they do show up.
Warning:  Attempting to use an Infiltrator's Tactical Cloak to ""dash past"" into the room with the looters will result in an awkward surprise: when you return the Blood Pack will be heavily reinforced with as many as four Pyros. Although it is possible to evade them and reach Mordin's Lab without fighting anything, it's a low-odds proposition and tends to take longer than just fighting everything.
On the left side of the large room is another room that links to an apartment. In the other room grab the container of eezo, then head inside the apartment proper. The apartment has some unwanted tenants: human looters. You can let them go, or shoot them. Either way ask them questions first. They will fill you in on what happened and how the plague spread. Once done asking your questions, make your decision on the looters, and then leave. Head back out and down the stairs, following the signs to the clinic.
Mordin's Clinic[]
Mordin's waiting room: patients for the curing, a weapons locker for the hurting
Outside the clinic there is a detachment of human and mech guards. The guards if questioned tell you not to make any trouble unless you want to deal with the mechs and the professor himself. Head in and question as many people as you can; although there is no actual conversation, they tell stories of how the professor seems to be helping them and how he defended the clinic from a few attacks, and so forth. Head down the back hall and head to the left first, pick up two crates, some medi-gel and access a computer for a research item: the crates contain palladium and platinum, the research increases your medi-gel capacity after the mission. Once done in here go into the other room and before talking to Mordin pick up the medi-gel, power cells, and more resources: this time the other two, iridium and eezo. Once the items are acquired, talk to Mordin.
Aria was right: Mordin likes to talk, and fast—he reasons quickly and out loud. This habit may prompt Shepard to perform the occasional interrupt (a Renegade or Paragon one here, and another Paragon one after the mission on the Normandy) to forestall any unnecessary rambling. Mordin is friendly, however, which is a change of pace for this district. As the Illusive Man stated, he is also brilliant: he not only easily deduces you are with Cerberus (if you don't tell him up front), but he has apparently already found a cure for the plague and needs only to distribute it. You invite Mordin to join your mission to stop the Collectors, but he declines for the moment because he wants to cure the plague first. He plans to spread the cure via the ventilation system, though there is a catch: the air-control facility is guarded by Blood Pack vorcha.
Mordin recalls with fondness his work for the Salarian STG
Just as Mordin finishes, said air flow system shuts down, adding the threat of suffocation to the problems you already had. Shepard volunteers to deal with the vorcha and reactivate the air flow fans, simultaneously distributing the cure to the entire district. On the plus side, Mordin, eager for a new challenge, promises to join your team if you are successful. You can ask a few more questions, and also ask that Mordin send someone for the sick batarian you met (if you didn't allow him to die). To help you in your upcoming fight, Mordin gifts you a new gun, the M-6 Carnifex Hand Cannon, but he will also ask a favor: to keep an eye out for his assistant Daniel, who went into vorcha territory alone to find some batarians to give them the cure; Mordin would like you to rescue him and bring him back alive.
To Environmental Control[]
Tip: There is a Weapons Locker in the clinic that you can use on your way out to change any of your team's weapons to fit your preference. Note that all party members including Shepard that carry heavy pistols are now equipped with the Carnifex. If you're new to a certain weapon type and want to test anything out before leaving the clinic, you can: leave out the exit door but don't go too far. Once you get just far enough outside to unholster your weapons again, stop, and you can fire your guns as much as you want to get a feel for them without getting locked out of the clinic. Then just head back inside, hit the locker again, and all of your non-heavy weapon ammo will be fully refilled.
The vorcha might be barely competent to hold guns in lore, but the sheer amount of AI-accurate firepower they can pump out quickly adds up to stripped shields and an undignified death
This is a good save point. Once you're ready (there is one more medi-gel next to the clinic exit), go out of the clinic, up the stairs, and be ready for a fight. Get into cover and use it to take out the attacking Blood Pack: a single Blood Pack Pyro, and a lot of Blood Pack Troopers initially. If you go in first then you have a chance to catch them off guard and take out one of them. Using a sniper rifle to target the flame tank on the nearby Pyro makes the most dramatic entrance. Try not to let the vorcha get in cover, because their regeneration will allow them to completely regenerate their health. If your squad has Incinerate or Warp, then they can be applied to a vorcha (once its armor has been stripped) to permanently prevent regeneration. Be mindful of explosive containers strewn about the place, shoot at them whenever enemies draw near.
Later, two Blood Pack Warriors eventually emerge, one from the green door in the far side of the room and another from the emergency exit stairs, and will charge you while the vorcha stay put. In addition, this area sometimes has a little ""glitch"" (one might call it a tactic) insofar as Pack members will sometimes not move and stay out of your line of sight, requiring you to go hunting for the Pack.
The goal is to proceed toward the emergency exit sign after dealing with the room's heavy hitters
Camping Strategy: After the entering the door from the clinic and the loading screen ends, order your squad members to stay put at the bottom of the stairs. As mentioned above, snipe and use powers to kill the Pyro quickly then run back down the stairs. From this point on, the rest of the battle is poking your head out around the archway to snipe or use powers on the remaining enemies. The krogan and vorcha that appear will get stuck in a pattern of running next to the left side of archway, out into the middle of the room, then the right side of the room. If you stay low on the stairs, pop out and chip away at the enemies, they will eventually all die. They won't come down the stairs after you if you stay glued to the bottom of the stairs. This will also give you time to recharge your shields. You may have to go out into the room to get a vorcha or two that hunker down and won't come out but the rest is playing the long and slow patient game. Once you have killed off all of the bad guys, a second pyro will show up from the left side of the screen with a few other vorcha. Take the Pyro down quickly then repeat the same run and hide strategy. This strategy makes the battle much easier as you can take your time and use whichever weapons and powers you want to finish this battle without wasting ammo or getting killed quickly on Insanity difficulty by a room full of enemies.
Just when you thought the slog is over, another one threatens to ruin your day
When you've cleared out the initial wave and the krogan wave, be wary of proceeding up the emergency exit stairs as there is a final wave of reinforcements: a bunch of vorcha troopers, a pyro, and a last Blood Pack Warrior. Fortunately all of them are funneled into the stairs and you won't have to worry about flanking until they get down.
Once they are all eliminated look around for a gambling terminal by the side of the emergency exit stairs, which can be hacked for 3,000 credits, and a medical station on the other side for another medi-gel.
In case of directional disorientation, the door to Daniel is to the left while the door to the environmental controls is to the right
After stocking up, move and go up the emergency exit stairs; hack the bank terminal for 5,000 credits. Go up the next flights of stairs where you find a short hallway with two doors. The door on the right advances the mission, but the door on the left has some upset batarians and Daniel. See Omega: The Professor: Missing Assistant for resolving this assignment, and save before opening the door as there are multiple possible outcomes here.
Once the decision is made, leave the room and open the other door at the end of the hall. The next room has three Blood Pack Troopers. Apparently the Pack has moved closer to the clinic than Mordin realized, and they have taken a lot more territory than originally thought. In any case, fight through the Blood Pack as you come across them, head down some stairs, and move on until you reach a very large room where there is no ceiling.
Conventional skirmishing means eliminating everyone before proceeding, but there are other ways
This room – apparently the entrance to the District Environment Control facility – has three interior staircases, all leading to various parts of the lower level. Meanwhile, where those large fans are across the way from you, Vorcha Heavies will appear and begin shooting rockets. If you shoot them down, they're replaced by Blood Pack Boom-Squads. You now have a choice between different approaches—which will affect the mix of enemies you are faced with:
Staying Upstairs: Option 1 is to stay upstairs at least until all the rocket vorcha are taken out. Up to six of them will spawn, but since the vorcha down below will not try to come upstairs with you, you can eventually get rid of all the rocket launchers. There are explosive canisters near the rocketeers so always target them when there's opportunity. After the first Heavy, the remainder may not fire at all if you are far enough away. Once you've eliminated all the upstairs enemies, you can use the balcony to pick off the vorcha down below from relative safety. If you fight the whole battle upstairs, only regular Blood Pack Troopers will spawn down below. If you head downstairs while enemies are still spawning, Blood Pack Warriors and and Blood Pack Pyros will also spawn.
Friendly reminder that you don't actually have to kill everyone, only those in your way
Rushing Downstairs: Option 2 is to head downstairs immediately via the staircase to your immediate left. When you get to the bottom, rush forward as quickly as you can along the far left side of the room. This will take you underneath the far balcony where the rocket launchers can no longer fire on you, and there is plenty of cover in that corner from which to engage the enemy forces on the ground. If you go this route you avoid the battle with the rocketeers entirely, but krogan and Pyro vorcha will spawn in addition to the standard vorcha and will advance upon your position. This option can be particularly effective if Shepard is an Engineer, because spawning a drone anywhere near the exit door will stop the further spawn of enemies. There is sparse cover if going this route, but you can take refuge behind several pillars and the short end of a barricade.
Bearing all that in mind, choose the type of battle you want and take out the remaining Blood Pack. If you wish to save here, make sure to go in past the doors and inside (you may have to eliminate the rocketeers above to clear the area for saving if you ignored them earlier). If you don't, then when you reload you will have to fight all over again.
Moving inside you will soon confront a few more hostiles in a small room: a couple of pistol-packing Blood Pack Troopers and a single Blood Pack Warrior (beware the krogan). On the right you can find some spare parts (1,000 credits) and some medi-gel. The gel is valuable because the upcoming fight is a hard one. As you go up the stairs one of your squadmates reminds you how to disperse the cure. Before opening the next door, save (Note:  This is one of the last saving points for the mission for both manual and autosave).
Environmental Control[]
A vorcha exposes his softer side to Shepard and crew
When you enter you encounter an unusually talkative vorcha, who makes clear that he and his accomplices are in league with the Collectors. Whatever your responses to this guy, there's no standing down and a fight must proceed. You'll face a Pyro, a Boom-Squad, a Heavy, and a rifle-toting Trooper. Get in cover quickly in the small barricade in front of you or the rails off on either side to avoid being shredded by gunfire or rockets to the face, then mow them down as per standard procedure.
Once the vorcha are down, EDI will come over your comm and tell you where to start the ventilation process by inserting the cure, but you need to start the main system and inject the cure before continuing. Note:  You can actually sequence-break by rushing to the back of the room and inserting the cure while there are still enemies about, but this will deprive you of breathing room against the incoming onslaught and is therefore not recommended.
As soon as you activate the main system by inserting the cure, vorcha and krogan will stream in from the general direction whence you entered. Vorcha Heavies will also appear on the catwalk across from your position (above your original entrance). Usually you can take out the Heavies across the way first and let your squad deal with the Pack members streaming in. Alternatively, if you clear the ground and advance on their position, you can approach closely enough that you are outside of their firing angle. If you are far enough away, they might not fire at all.
View of the main environmental system, with the fan-control rooms on either side
You must now turn the two fans on, one on each side, so after you've taken out the Heavies and other threats, pick the ventilation-control room to attack first. Each of two ventilation-control rooms, where the fans are activated, flank the main system on either side, but on a slightly lower level. No matter which side you want to do first, the process is the same, but you have several strategies available:
Conventional Approach: Move downstairs toward a control room and quickly put your squad in cover; the control-room door will open on its own as several Blood Pack members will pour out. There will be lots of Pyros, so don't let them get close. Shooting their flame tanks can make them explode and damage their friends. Likewise an Incinerate or Overload applied to a Pyro from which the armor has been stripped will instantly create a helpful explosion.
Reaching one fan station is the easy part, getting to the other one is the hard part
Once you put them down, move into the control room and activate the fans for that side (be aware that there's a medical station in each control room). Once the fan is activated, go back out of the room and take cover behind one of the nearest pillars—more enemies usually confront you here. Don't try to advance back up the stairs until the enemies stop coming to you, as the other side will already be teeming with Blood Pack and multiple Heavies will have mounted the upper catwalks across from you. Approach the stairs carefully, because a krogan sometimes charges down them at this point, and a Pyro often spawns here as well. Keep both at a safe distance and avoid coming up the stairs into target range of the Heavies before you've dealt with them.
Now move up the stairs and take cover from the barrage of rockets which will be fired at you from the opposite balcony. Note that the first fans clearly cause strong winds; with well-used powers (such as Pull, Throw, or Shockwave), the squad can knock enemies off their feet, who will then catch the wind and be blown around. This tactic is particularly useful for getting rid of the Heavies on the catwalks, who can literally be blown away. In any event, once you can head down to the remaining control room, the door opens again revealing even more enemies. Once they are all down move in and activate the fans (but not before claiming the medigel). Your squad will say some things but you are quickly transported back to the clinic.
Those with the skills can cloak or charge their way out, those without will be forced to yet another gunfight/power slog
Use the Terrain: When proceeding from the first control room to the second, it is possible to use the terrain to avoid having to fight the rocket-launching Boom-Squads at all. Once you've turned the fan on and fought your way through the wave of troops that spawns—taking care to make sure you've cleared any krogan and Pyro from the staircase area—run quickly across to the other side of the room, dashing under the balcony the heavies are on, which will prevent the rocket troops from being able to fire on you. In this scenario you now only need fight whatever troops spawn from the second control room, and those are likely to be relatively sparse. Once you turn on the second fan, the rest of the vorcha give up in frustration.
Game the Spawn Points: One can also game the enemy spawn points to prevent the spawning of any more heavies. The key to this strategy is clearing both the left and right wings before turning either fan on, which prevents the second, larger, spawn of rocket-firing heavies. For this strategy one can proceed otherwise-as-normal, clearing each side wing with your squad, but not turning any fans on until both wings are cleared—there will still be a final spawn of vorcha and krogan on the middle platform after the first fan is turned on, but no heavies.
Dodging krogan and rockets at the same time: fun
Super Methodical: Or, to take things even more slowly, remain on the main central level for as long as possible. Once you have cleared out all of the enemies on the main level you are on, you will be able to see both the left and right fan ventilation room paths on the lower levels. Don't go down onto the lower levels yet! Place your squadmates into cover on either the right or left side on the higher level so that you can see a fan ventilation room door down below. Get as close to that door on the higher level as you can. (Whichever fan ventilation room on the lower level you want to clear out first, it doesn't matter which one. Stick to finishing one side until you've cleared it out). Take Shepard and go slowly down onto the lower level you have picked. Move forward towards the fan ventilation room door. As soon as you see it open, run back up to the higher level where your squadmates are located at and snipe or use powers to kill the 2 vorcha and 1 Pyro that came out of the door. If your squadmates are in cover far enough forward on the higher level, and in view of the door on the lower level, the enemies will stay in cover on the lower level and you can kill them easily. 
Once the enemies on the lower level die, put your squadmates back into cover (if they have come out of cover), go back down to the same lower level fan ventilation room door, and repeat the process again of drawing out the enemies, running back up to the higher level, and killing the bad guys. You will know the process is complete when no new enemies spawn when you approach the fan ventilation room.
Reposition your squadmates to the opposite side of the higher platform once you have cleared one of the side areas leading to the fan ventilation rooms on the lower level. Repeat the same process this time on the opposite side by having Shepard run down to the lower level, draw out enemies, run back up to cover, kill them, and repeat until they are all dead. You will know you are done when nothing spawns when you approach either fan ventilation room. This strategy greatly reduces the amount of enemies you have to fight next when you turn on the fans and you can do this slowly and carefully without wasting ammo. The enemies seem less likely to show up in hordes if you clear both sides first. The rocket-launching Boom-Squads on the balcony don't spawn in this variant.
Sometimes the game just hates you and makes activating the second fan extra challenging
Save your game before you turn on the first fan (if it will let you do so). Before you pick a side to turn the fan on, get your squadmates into cover in the fan room on the sides of the doorway as enemies will spawn outside on the lower level when you turn on the fan. Some enemies will stay in cover, some will charge you depending upon how far forward you move on the lower level. If you get the enemies out of cover, run back to the fan room and use your squadmates for help. Be patient! If you take your time, you can draw out and kill everything. Focus on krogan or Pyros when they show up as they will close quickly and kill you fast. Normal vorcha are annoying but they tend to stay put in cover usually unless you flush them out by getting close to them. Clear everything out and then move over to the other fan room lower level. Take your time and watch your radar for hidden enemies. Make sure you get any medi-gel or ammo you want before you start the second fan because it goes straight to the clinic when you activate fan two.
Mordin's Clinic Round 2[]
Once back in the clinic Mordin tells you that the plague levels are dropping throughout the district. He says that he is satisfied and ready to join your team; he mentions working with Cerberus and how unexpected it is that they are working with aliens. You can now head back to the Normandy or stay in the clinic. Stay if you want to get any of the things mentioned earlier, but you can also see and talk to several of the people you encountered earlier, if you saved them (the sick batarian and Daniel) or convinced them to go to the clinic (the human refugees). You can talk to many patients and employees for their new perspectives. When you are done, return to the Normandy."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Thane:_Sins_of_the_Father,"Prerequisite: Dossier: The Assassin
Kelly will say that Thane wishes to speak to Shepard. Thane has been contemplating his mortality and has checked in on his only remaining family member, his son, Kolyat. Kolyat apparently wants to practice the same profession as his father, which greatly troubles Thane. He asks Shepard to go to the Citadel to stop his son from becoming like his father.","Go to the Citadel and select Thane as one of the squad members.
Finding out the target[]
Thane asks Mouse about Kolyat
Talk to Captain Bailey at C-Sec  and ask about Thane's son. Bailey checks and finds that a local petty criminal named Mouse was seen talking to a drell. Mouse was a poor kid who grew up on the Citadel. He is also selling VIs of Shepard. Mouse can be found on Level 28 near Rodam Expeditions. Mouse recognizes Thane. About a decade ago, Thane used Mouse when he was a child to gather information on his assassination targets. Shepard can convince Mouse to say who hired Thane's son by:
Renegade interrupt (+5 Renegade)
Charm (+5 Paragon)
Intimidate (+5 Renegade)
Paying him 3,000 credits
Mouse will reveal that Elias Kelham, a small-time criminal who got big after the geth attack wiped out many crime bosses, hired Kolyat for a hit.
Note that in order to find out about the Shepard VIs, Shepard needs to ask about them before asking about Kelham. Shepard can ask for a copy of the VI, for Mouse to stop selling them, or for a cut of the profits. None of the choices has any effect on the game and the player never gets to see the Shepard VI.
It isn't really necessary to mess up Kelham's face, but given his attitude you might as well try it sometime
Go back to Captain Bailey to ask about finding Kolyat. The situation is awkward for the C-Sec captain, because he and Kelham have an arrangement—Kelham bribes Bailey and he looks the other way. Nevertheless, Bailey is willing to help Shepard by arresting Kelham and providing an opportunity for Shepard and Thane to interrogate him. You must now try to make Kelham confess before his lawyer arrives.
With a high Renegade score, Shepard can Intimidate Kelham to an instant confession (""I'm a Spectre. Start talking.""). In this case, unlike the below instance, it doesn't matter if Shepard was actually reinstated by the Council.
Shepard can beat Kelham three times (Renegade interrupts following Kelham's responses to questioning) to make him confess in time. The confession can only be gotten if Kelham is beaten all three times consecutively. Otherwise, he remains defiant if beaten once or twice.
Advise Thane to play Good Cop, take the first Renegade interrupt and avoid the second and third, instead using Charm options to get the confession before the lawyer enters the room. Kelham will be angry at being manipulate, but nothing can be done about it. He asks for the name of the one who sold him out; Shepard can mock him one last time or sell out Mouse (Renegade) before his lawyer ""kindly"" advises him to shut up as they leave.
If Thane was advised to play Good Cop or Bad Cop, and Shepard uses Charm (""We'll sweeten the pot."") or Intimidate (""You really should talk to us."") for the last dialogue point, the advocate will enter the room and interrupt Shepard before the Commander can convince Kelham. Using Charm/Intimidate fully and still getting the confession therefore requires Shepard choose the neutral option (""Plan?"") when Thane asks how to approach Kelham's interrogation.
If Kelham's advocate interrupts the interrogation before Kelham confesses, Shepard can still use their Spectre status (only if actually reinstated by the Council) or make a deal which either blackmails his lawyer that Kelham was bribing people or threaten everyone in the room with a firearm (""I am done negotiating""). The advocate will either be powerless to stop Shepard or advise Kelham to make the deal.
Eventually Kelham will confess to ordering the hit on Joram Talid, a turian running for local office, whose platform is based on anti-human sentiments as Bailey reveals.
Following Talid[]
Bailey arranges for transportation to where Talid is. Thane tells Shepard to shadow Talid from above from the catwalks. Shepard should go to the right to find a datapad that will provide the heavy pistol upgrade. Then Shepard can update Thane on Talid's location. The majority of the mission will consist of moving close to Talid, updating Thane on Talid's location, and then waiting for Talid to move again. In Mass Effect Legendary Edition, a large blue box centered on Talid's ""talk box"" was added, making it easier to spot him from the catwalks.
Joram Talid meets up with some folk of suspicious nature
Talid is easily spottable because of his krogan bodyguard. If Shepard is too far away, Thane will say he's losing sight of Talid. There is also plenty of time to regain sight of Talid if Shepard loses him. If Shepard does not update Thane on Talid's location, there will be a cutscene in which Kolyat murders Talid and Thane laments that his son's path was inevitable. The mission will be considered complete, but Thane will not be loyal.
After the fourth update, Talid waits outside a store while the krogan bodyguard goes inside. Then the two will run into a nightclub. Talid then meets with a group of krogan.
Shepard will then encounter a stock boy, Jim Reynolds, up in the catwalks. Shepard can use a Renegade interrupt, Charm, or Intimidate, to get past Jim. The Renegade interrupt is 5 Renegade points, the Charm option is 5 Paragon points, and the Intimidate option is 5 Renegade points. If Shepard does not choose one of these options, the player will be given more Renegade interrupts, Charms, and Intimidates, until finally Shepard knocks him out for zero morality points. Sometimes, the encounter with the stock boy will not trigger, but Shepard can proceed onwards and complete the mission. The catwalk part of the mission is over.
Tip: If you're replaying the mission and would like to complete it as quickly as possible, then when the krogan bodyguard goes in the store give Thane one last update on Talid's position, wait for the krogan to exit the store, and then you can proceed as quickly as possible to the stock boy and thence through the door to the final encounter. By moving quickly you will trigger the final cutscene before Thane notices you're too far from the target.
The Reunion[]
Kolyat is waiting for Talid. He wounds the bodyguard and pursues Talid to his apartment. Shepard and Thane chase after Kolyat. At Talid's apartment, Kolyat is ready to execute Talid when Shepard, Thane, Bailey, and a C-Sec officer arrive. Shepard can use a Paragon interrupt to distract Kolyat and disarm him. If not, Shepard has the more extreme option of wounding Kolyat, or the very extreme option of killing Talid for being criminal scum.
Father and son
Kolyat is angry at Thane for only just now caring about him. Shepard and Bailey then give Thane and Kolyat the opportunity to talk more in private. Back at the C-Sec station, Bailey tells Shepard he's been looking into the archives and found a series of murders ten years back where the primary suspect was a drell. Shepard tells Bailey not to pursue it.
Shepard, Thane, and Bailey then talk about what to do with Kolyat since he attempted committing murder. Charm for 5 Paragon points will convince Bailey to have Kolyat do community service. Intimidate for 5 Renegade points will cause Bailey to privately employ Kolyat. Doing neither sends Kolyat to prison.
Email[]
Captain Bailey will send Shepard the following message after the mission only if Thane and Kolyat got to talk with each other.
Update on the KidFrom: Captain Bailey, C-Sec

Hey, Shepard. Just wanted to let you know that the drell kid's doing okay.

Everything's taken care of legally, and he's doing some work for me. Helping me deal with some trash in the Wards, maybe make life better for some of the kids like Mouse. Not perfect, but then, what is?

Don't know if your drell and mine are talking. I told him life was too short not to, but I don't know if it took.

Good luck out there.

-Bailey
The message will be the same regardless of Bailey's decision on Kolyat."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Collector_Base:_Final_Battle,"There is no formal Journal entry for the final battle, but the battle is triggered as part of Stop the Collectors: Defeat the Collectors once you have completed Collector Base: The Long Walk.
Note: At the start of all three major segments of the Collector Base mission including this one, your medi-gel and heavy weapon ammo are given a complete refill to 100% capacity.  However, there will be no further opportunities to replenish medi-gel during the final battle.
Note:  While manual saving is not allowed from this point onwards, the game will auto-save at the beginning of each part. Loading an auto-save also gives you the opportunity to change the weapons loadout of your squad. If you die, you will have full ammo when you reload the game, even if you didn't have full ammo at the last save.","Reach the Central Chamber[]
Harbinger and its minions will try its darnedest to kill you
You must now reach the central chamber. A series of five platforms will fly in, each carrying several Collector enemies: Drones, Guardians, and eventually Assassins. Harbinger will make repeat appearances as usual, so try to eliminate drones as quickly as possible to force him to ""consume"" his more powerful Guardians and Assassins when he assumes control.
Powers must be used efficiently as ammo is very scarce and must be scavenged whenever possible: watch for opportunities to advance and fill up between enemy waves. As in the similar battle on board the Collector Cruiser, using abilities to knock Collectors off the platforms can be invaluable but you'll generally need to take out their barriers first.
The sixth and final platform contains three Abominations and two Scions. After defeating them there will be a console to trigger the next section.  Note that the two Scions are so far away they will usually not attack or move towards you until you approach their platform to engage them. Using long range fire or damage powers such as Warp it's possible to kill them from two platforms away before they are aware you exist. In any event, the Scions will be obstructed from advancing more than one platform due to their inability to climb down from their starting platform. Legendary Edition:  The Scions' initial platform is not raised, and they will thus be able to approach your position.
Destroy the Feeding Tubes[]
Failure to destroy tubes on the allotted time windows will cause the Human-Reaper to discharge a powerful blast
Your platform will now fly into the central chamber and a cutscene will introduce the final enemy, a Human-Reaper Larva. When you regain control, quickly climb to the uppermost platform on your right - until the Reaper activates it is a safe location that will give you a height advantage over arriving enemies. More fly-in platforms with various types of Collectors (and Harbinger) will now arrive. After clearing each platform, the armor covering the four tubes of the inactive Human-Reaper will open for a short period of time and they should be destroyed immediately (one of your squadmates will helpfully remind you if you forget).
Tip:  Just as on the Collector Ship, using heavy weapons to quickly neutralize the Collectors while they are grouped up on the platforms is a good way to minimize the threat they pose to your squad especially at higher difficulties.  There will also be opportunities to replenish heavy weapon ammo in the upcoming fight.
You should be able to destroy at least two tubes each time they become vulnerable; you should avoid using any single-shot weapon such as the M-92 Mantis or M-300 Claymore for best results. The Soldier can destroy all four tubes in one Adrenaline Rush using an assault rifle such as the Mattock or Revenant. The Geth Plasma Shotgun can also take out two tubes since its three plasma rounds take time to reach their target letting you line up your shot at the next tube. The Collector Particle Beam can destroy all four tubes in just one go before the covers come down.  It is also possible to destroy the tubes or at least heavily damage them by using biotic powers such as Pull, Throw, or Warp, so having squad members with this ability can be useful. You can also instruct squad members to attack the exposed tubes while attacking a different one yourself to take down at least two tubes with standard weapons.
Destroying all four tubes will cause the Reaper to fall into the chasm below.  After watching its apparent demise, Shepard will contact the ground team left behind to hold the line against the Collectors and request a status report. One of the team members will respond; who it is can vary depending on which team members remain alive and who is in Shepard's squad.  Shepard orders the ground team to begin falling back to the Normandy, then orders Joker to prep the ship for departure from the hopefully soon-to-be-destroyed base.
Shepard then opens up the platform's core and prepares to destroy the station by overloading its reactor, but the Illusive Man interrupts.  He asks Shepard to instead trigger a radiation pulse that will kill the remaining Collectors but preserve the facility to ""secure humanity's future against the Reapers and beyond."" Shepard will then need to make a choice: destroying the facility is a Paragon action, while preserving the facility for Cerberus to use against the Reapers is a Renegade action.
Note:  During this conversation, Shepard might refer to team members giving their lives even if the entire team has survived up to this point (depending on the selected dialogue option). Also, if Miranda is in the party, a few extra lines of dialogue between her and the Illusive Man can be heard.
Whatever Shepard's decision, once the call with the Illusive Man ends and the chosen sabotage of the Collector Base is complete, Shepard tells the squad that they have only a limited time to escape the station. However, before they can leave the team is interrupted by one final surprise.
The Human-Reaper Larva[]
Duck and cover when you see its mouth beam reach critical charging levels
As it turns out, the Human-Reaper isn't dead yet. After your decision on the Collector Base's fate it reactivates and hauls its way up to your set of platforms to do battle with you.
You start behind a good barricade spot and you can begin shooting at the Reaper's weak spots: eyes (two in the left socket, one in the right) or the large weak point on its chest. The so-called weak spots are all armor, so if you need to change your loadouts for more effective weapons via autosave do so.
Almost any weapon that works well against armor can be effective here. Despite the short range of most shotguns the size of the Human-Reaper's weak points makes it possible to still do reasonable damage. The Human-Reaper moves around a lot which can make aiming through a sniper zoom challenging. Out of all the heavy weapons, the Collector Particle Beam is probably the most ammo-efficient and effective at attacking the weak points as well as being the easiest to aim. If you are confident enough with your aiming skills then feel free to unload on the monstrosity with whatever weapon you're comfortable with. Anti-armor powers such as Warp or Incinerate also work well and don't miss unless the Human-Reaper retreats before they hit home.
...Or you risk getting caught when it it's-a-firin' its lazor
At periodic intervals during your fight with the Human-Reaper, Collector soldiers fly in. Harbinger will quickly inhabit one of them as usual, though it possesses a unique property during this fight: when it dies it may drop a white colored pickup that works exactly like power cells, refilling ammo for all of Shepard's weapons including heavy weapons. Harbinger is more likely to drop this power cell pickup if you aren't at maximum heavy weapon ammo when it dies.
Tip: If you are in need of additional ammo refills, the platform to the right and forward of where Shepard starts contains one respawning thermal clip near the edge you can grab during lulls in the action. The Human-Reaper never upends this platform, however, the area is quite exposed.
The Human-Reaper has a nasty charge-up attack and it would be wise to take cover until it fires. If you are caught in the beam, your shield will be knocked out and will take longer than usual to recharge (Tip: using upgraded medi-gel or activating a shield restoring power such as Barrier or Tech Armor will counteract this). This attack can work to your advantage, however, as it doesn't discriminate—it will instantly kill any Collectors caught in the blast including Harbinger. If you're feeling brave, you can also take advantage of the fact that it remains still while charging its attack to get in some reliable damage; listening to the charge-up sound will tell you when it's time to get back behind cover.
Note: The Reaper's glowing mouth is yet another weak point you can damage while this attack is charging.
Hold the central platform with your squad, and avoid the three rear platforms. Make runs to respawning thermal clips at (A) or (B) as needed.
Warning:  After your first engagement with the Reaper, it will disappear below the platform and return in a different location. It will sometimes destroy one of the side platforms when it does this, and if you are on the platform at the time you will be killed. Squadmates can also be killed if they are on the left rear platform (they can't climb up to the right rear platform), but if revived with Unity they will reappear in the central area. A safer spot to camp out for this section is the barricade on the forward central platform, as it provides cover from all directions and a high wall that can be interposed between you and the Reaper when needed. Note that you can also be knocked off the very edge of any platform bordering empty space if the Reaper decides to crash into it, so never hang out there for long, if at all.
When the Reaper's life is below 25%, it will move and attack more often. Continue shooting at its weak points and the fight should be over shortly, leading to the end of game cutscenes.
Cutscenes will vary depending on who survives the Suicide Mission. If at least two companions survive, one will pull up Shepard into the Normandy. Otherwise, Joker will vainly attempt to help the commander and ultimately cause his or her fall and subsequent death.
Note:  At the end of the battle when you talk to Joker via comm link, he will tell you all ""survivors"" have made it back to the ship, even if you saved your entire team and crew."

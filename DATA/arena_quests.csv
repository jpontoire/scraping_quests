"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Arena:Crypt_of_Hearts","Sleep and receive a vision from Ria Silmane. Travel to High Rock and meet with the Brotherhood of Seth. Go through the Mines of Khuras to acquire a map to the Crypt of Hearts. Have the Brotherhood decipher the map to learn exactly where the Crypt is. Retrieve the sixth piece of the Staff of Chaos from the Crypt. Repel another attack by Jagar Tharn.","Sleep and Dream[edit] Go to sleep again and Ria Silmane will speak to you: ""It has become a habit, congratulating you on your success. Still, there are three pieces left, and what guards them only the Divine Lady may know. I have spent many a day searching the ethereal planes for some clue as the location of the sixth piece of the Staff. This is what I have found. The piece was sent to a place called the Crypt of Hearts. I have no clue as to the location of such a place. The price for the little knowledge I have was... exacting. Still, only three provinces remain that can hold these last pieces. It can only lie in one of these. Good luck..."" Camlorn, Part 1[edit] Asking around about the Crypt of Hearts leads you eventually to the Brotherhood of Seth in Camlorn, High Rock.  There you are told by Halfas Varn that one of their junior members went mad, talking about how the Emperor was kidnapped and he needed the Staff of Chaos to free him.  He fled with a map telling them where the Crypt is, and they know where he went.  If you agree to get the map back, they mark the location of the Mines of Khuras on your map. Mines of Khuras[edit] The mines are located a short way southeast of Camlorn.  This is a bi-level dungeon with huge levels. Upon entering, you will receive a message: The sulphuric air of the Mines of Khuras hits you like a wall of heat, bringing tears to your eyes. Through the shimmering air you can see numerous lava flows and pits that lie scattered about the scorched ground, treacherous and deadly... Around you lie pools of seething lava welling up from deep below and releasing their gases into the air, which seems tainted but breathable... Near the entrance, you will also find a dead body with a clue as to where to go next: This body you surmise is that of an unlucky adventurer. The flesh seems torn, and perhaps  chewed. Scrawled in blood on the floor next  to it are the letters, 'SW'... You will find lava in abundance as well as magic-, fire-, and shock-throwing monsters, so ensure that you have plenty of defensive magic (potions, spells, or magic items) on hand.  Because spell-throwing monsters can kill you while you're climbing out of a pit, it's also very helpful to have Levitation so you either stay out of pits or, if you end up in one, don't have to laboriously climb out. On the first level, the way down is more or less in the center of the dungeon.  Levitation is a big help in negotiating the puddles of lava that are abundant here.  You could jump over them, but it's often difficult to do that without landing in another flaming puddle on the other side. Throughout the level you may receive various messages, apparently clues left behind by the Brother Barnabas: Scratched into the wall here is a short message,  'Ware the Emperor. His minions await me. A strange message to find within these depths... - Scratched into the wall here is a strange message, The secret of the Staff is mine. The wicked shal- The writing ends abruptly, as if the writer was suddenly interrupted... The fastest way down is to head west in the first east-west corridor and take the first opening south.  Immediately work your way a short bit back east, then go south quite a way.  Eventually you should see the blue dot that shows you where to go down (51,58); it'll likely be a bit east of where you're going south. Upon accessing the second level, you will receive another message: You enter the bowels of the Mines, aware that all around you lie creatures that have come to call this forsaken place their home... - There is an absence of light in the area, only adding to the forlorn feeling of abandonment... Map fragment While it thankfully has little lava, this level has pits a-plenty and not a few tunnels; it is very maze-like, dark, and difficult to navigate.  You can find the map fragment (and what's left of Brother Barnabas) in the southeast (the small room above the 'BLACKMARSH' tunnels) of the level (21,86). Here, collect your prize: You have found the Map fragment, only slightly discolored by Brother Barnabas' blood. With the help of the Brotherhood of Seth, you may succeed where Barnabas failed... Your best bet to get out of the dungeon quickly is to take the trench south of where you entered to where it comes out, then make your way south and east as best you can. Camlorn, Part 2[edit] Back at the Temple, return the map and the brothers will mark the location of the Crypt of Hearts on your map. Crypt of Hearts[edit] ""The chill of death seems to touch your heart as you gaze upon the stone walls of the Crypt of Hearts. Above the entrance stands a grinning skull, a warning to those who would traverse the halls of the dead. You can sense the sixth piece of the Staff of Chaos, somewhere below..."" As you enter the crypt: You stand in the Crypt of Hearts, a world of darkness  and death. The air is still, decayed with age, and the  smell of sulphur pervades the air. A hot wind seems to  be coming from around the corner, to the south... This is a four-level dungeon.  The first level is quite large, though the lower levels are smaller.  Every type of undead are plentiful here, as you might expect.  There is also a large number of the most deadly of monsters, the stone golem. This dungeon is easily the most difficult so far, and the fourth level is especially challenging. Passwall is particularly helpful here, because many of the levels offer a shortcut to the exit if you have it. Bring as many Potions of Heal True as you can. A couple of Potions of Invisibility can protect you from the stone golems of the bottom level, which might not spot you right away.  Resistance potions  and a lot of Potions of Levitation will be beneficial too. The dungeon doesn't really offer much treasure, even if you'll find dead bodies from time to time, sometimes including nice magical items. The way down on the first level is in the north center of the level.  Make your way west while staying as far north as possible and you'll quickly find it. This level also holds another chance to meet your first vampire, if you didn't meet one already in the Crystal Tower (he will be located in the half-circle room in the center of this floor). Mind the fields of lava around the place, there are usually floating rocks to allow you passage but a levitation spell will always come in handy. Throughout this first level you may explore various locations hidden past the fields of lava, usually containing treasure and signaled by messages popping up on the screen to inform you of this: This large room is filled with a seething pool of lava. In the distance can be seen many floating blocks, held up by some sort of magic. Perhaps the field of fire may after all be safely traversed... - On the other side of the lava run are temple walls with inscriptions that seem to twist your very thoughts towards baser instincts The smell of death lingers in the hot air. Drums can be heard in the distance... - You come upon a strange sight. Humans have evidently been killed, each next to a small guttering candle. In the center of this bizarre sacrifice stands a closed crypt made of heavy stone... - In the middle of this sea of lava stands a temple. You can see its rune incripted walls shimmering in the heat... Finally, upon reaching the stairs down the second level: You stand near the stairs leading down further into this crypt of the dead. A cold air gusts from the opening, bringing with it the smell of decaying flesh... The second level is quite small in terms of actual area to explore.  The way down is in the southwest section.  If you have Passwall and don't want to explore, it's worth cutting your way south immediately, skirting the pit of floating floor tiles, and then making directly south for the way down.  Otherwise make your way east down the long corridor on the north section, then back west as you can. As you enter the next level, you are warned: You enter the third level of the Crypt of Hearts.  The walls are covered with a sticky, foul smelling, mucus-like substance. In the distance can be heard screams of agony... Throughout, you may receive other such messages, including: A foul wind passes by... - From somewhere comes the smell of sulphur, and along with it a blast of hot air... The third level is also small.  Again, if you have Passwall and don't want to explore, getting to the way down is a snap; you can probably see the blue dot on the map as soon as you enter the level.  Cut through the wall right behind where you entered.  If you don't have Passwall, you'll have to go a way north and east, then down a very long corridor south and, eventually, back west. As you go even deeper into the crypt,you receive another message: You stand in the tombs of heroes long dead. A low moan can be heard through these vaulted corridors. The fourth level is larger and more problematic.  It is heavily pocked with trenches and pits, so Levitation is an enormous help, particularly when having to deal with the very dangerous (especially while distant) stone golems and wraiths.  The Staff piece is in the center of the level, within a Temple in the center of the room, as the game will let you know soon enough: You can see what looks like a large crypt or temple far in the center of this room of chasms... If you have Passwall, you can immediately head north, cut through the east wall, and instantly find yourself in the area where the Staff piece room is. This is highly recommended; also use invisibility to get through to the Staff piece room without being attacked. Otherwise, you are in for a long trek east, then a long trek north, then a long trek west, then a shorter trek south before you can get into that area.  Once in that area, there are more fell beasts and automata, plus of course a riddle-locked door: Few have gained these hallowed halls, Brave fools who wouldst face the puzzle... - There is a thing, which nothing is, Yet it has a name. It's sometimes tall And sometimes short It tumbles when we fall It joins our sport, And plays at every game... - What then, doth I speak of? The possible answers are ""Shadow"", ""A Shadow"", ""My Shadow"" and ""Your Shadow"". A correct answer opens the door and gives you a message: Thou art correct mortal. Proceed to thy fate... Unlike other dungeons, you won't experience negative consequences by answering incorrectly, just a different message: Think again, then speak with wisdom... As you enter the room, you see the Staff Piece (30,32 you were looking for, guarded by two Fire Daemons. Take care of them or avoid them and take the Staff piece (30,32). The sixth piece of the Staff of Chaos slides into the nearly complete rod like a sword into a sheath... Ambush[edit] After arriving back in town, Jagar Tharn will send a monster to kill you and a vision to warn you: ""You have rejected my offer of everlasting life, and defeated the Crypt of Hearts. Your list of accomplishments grow. You will not however, accomplish the forging of the Staff. My forces are inexhaustible, and you will succumb. Prepare, for my servants arrive..."""
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Arena:Crystal_Tower","Go to sleep and receive another vision from Ria Silmane. Travel to the Mages Guild of Lillandril, Summurset Isle. Retrieve a diamond from the Priests in the Temple of Mad God. Return the diamond to the Mages Guild to learn of the location of the Crystal Tower. Recover the fifth piece of the Staff of Chaos from the Crystal Tower. Survive yet another attack from Jagar Tharn.","Sleep, sleep, sleep[edit] Ria Silmane will visit you the next time you sleep after retrieving a piece of the Staff of Chaos from Elsweyr. She will tell you: ""You have recovered the fourth piece! I honor your bravery. Listen closely now my friend, for Tharn has begun in earnest to look for you. Do not fear, he does not know your true identity, but he can sense the Staff's power. With four of the eight pieces, you stand out like a lantern at night. I urge you to caution. The fifth piece of the Staff lies in an ancient stronghold of sorcery called the Crystal Tower. It was said that the southern tip of the Dragon's Teeth, which stretches from the ice covered mounts of High Rock to the wooded forests of Valenwood, could be seen on the horizon from the top parapet of the Tower. This would lead me to believe it is not far south of the majestic mountain range. You must find the Tower and gain access to recover the fifth piece of the Staff of Chaos..."" Lillandril, Part 1[edit] Asking around about the Crystal Tower leads you eventually to the Mages Guild in Lillandril, Summerset Isle. Corim Ashlen, the Loremaster of the Guild, tells you that they had a diamond that would tell them where the Crystal Tower is, but it was stolen by the Priests of the Mad God. The Guild also drew power from this diamond and for its safe return, are willing to share the tower's location. If you complete this task, the location of the Temple of Mad God is marked on your map. Temple of Mad God[edit] This temple, located a short way southeast of Lillandril, is a two-level dungeon with medium-sized levels full of monsters and monks. They are not much more difficult than the knights of the Temple of Agamanus in the previous quest, but their attacks are fast and dangerous. Don't underestimate them just because they aren't wearing armor. There are not many treasures here; in fact, this dungeon is almost empty, so the rewards of exploring will be mostly experience and loot from your battles. On the first level, the way down is in the south central section of the dungeon.  There's a lot of water on this level.  If you choose to follow the water far to the west and then south and then east, you will find the way down no problem, but it's definitely the longer and more dangerous way. You can stay on the floor and make your way south and west (but not too far west) and you'll get there more directly and with fewer encounters. The second level has a normal layout, but is quite large and full of endless chambers. If you find the large central treasure chamber (64,46), you'll find that you are too late. The treasure has been moved, but you also discover a note with a clue to its new location: A note on the floor instructs someone to move things to the secure storage area in the Northeast, ""before any meddlers arrive""... Indeed, the room has been emptied. The diamond is in the northeast section of the level. You want to head more north than east, as there are some dead ends if you go too far east. Thanks to the regular layout (no pits, no water), it's not hard to find. The diamond When you get to the room with the diamond, answer the riddle to unlock the door. The area above the door is inscribed with the following: - What flares up And does a lot of good, And when it dies, Is just a piece of wood? Answer with ""torch"", ""torches"", ""match"" or ""matches"", grab the diamond (16,3), and get back to Lillandril. Upon answering the riddle: The door moves slightly as the lock disengages Upon grabbing the diamond: You have found the Diamond Corim Ashlen sent you to recover. Only he can use it to see the Crystal Tower's location... (Beware the explorer's temptation; for just behind the diamond is a cascade of raised platforms beckoning you to ascend the stairs.  You will find that you can walk around the entire outer parameter of the dungeon.  If you dare to step over the edge, you may find that you can walk on air in an endless cavern. You may find a duplicate dungeon where the paths are the same, but all the walls are invisible.  You just might be able to return from your journey to complete your quest, or drop to the floor, and find that you are now trapped forever.  This truly is the Temple of Mad God.) Lillandril, Part 2[edit] Back at the Mages Guild, return the diamond so they can mark the location of the Crystal Tower on your map. Crystal Tower[edit] ""The Crystal Tower dominates the area, rising like an accusatory finger pointing at the sky above. This bastion of sorcery seemingly transcends normal human conceptions, existing in many planes other than this. You can sense the fifth piece of the Staff of Chaos, somewhere above..."" Upon accessing the dungeon, you may receive rather disheartening messages: All who enter this place, abandon hope... You enter the halls of the Crystal Tower, greeted by strange sounds and sights... This dungeon is the reverse of all the other dungeons you've found so far in that you have to go up.  Therefore, you are looking for green dots on your dungeon map rather than the blue dots you're used to searching for. In preparation, you may need lots of Potions of Heal True, Potions of Resist Shock (for use against homunculi), and a few Potions of Free Action (for use against medusa and spiders). Potions of Resist Fire could also be helpful, depending on your chosen stats and class. The Crystal Tower has four levels. They are all small, though, so at least it doesn't take long to fully explore each of them and pick up their many treasures. The treasures here contain a lot of magic items, such as torcs, bracelets, and crystals. The way up on the first level is in the northwest section. If you have Passwall, the most direct way is to just cut through straight north and loop a bit east.  Otherwise, make your way around as closely west as you can. The last corridor that leads to the exit, is the home of many trolls.  There is a chance you will meet your first vampire on this level. He's a very tough fight, and powerful magic is needed to beat him. Like with trolls, weapons can hurt him, but not defeat him. It's best to avoid him if you can't magically harm him, as his fireballs can cause a lot of damage. The second level is curiously icy, and ice creatures abound.  The way up is in the northeast corner.  If you have Passwall, you can just head east and cut through the wall.  Otherwise, when you get to the east wall you will have to make your way south and then back north. Here you will face many ice golems and homunculi.  There is a room (12,15) on this level where, if you enter it and the door closes behind you, you cannot then leave the room by normal means. There's no need to enter it at all, though, because it only contains one ice golem and one pile of treasure. There is a trench in front of the door and you cannot reach the door from the other side of the trench. If you are in this room and the door is indeed closed, there are only four ways out (short of reloading the game): Levitate over the trench and open the door. Use Passwall to cut through the walls to a place you can scale the trench and climb out. Rest and hope you encounter a monster that will open the door in its effort to get at you. Jump towards the door; when you reach the door you will stop for a split second and your mouse will appear, so you can open door.  This method can be difficult to accomplish, and may require several attempts. This section has a single waterway entrance (41,19) which can sometimes become blocked by hovering homunculi.  You may need to use Passwall to enter at a separate location. Also the entire far west corridor and southwest area contain a section that is separate from the main dungeon.  This area has another three loot piles and a chest, but can only be reached by using a spell such as Passwall. The third level, The Bestiary, is possibly the most interesting of all the dungeons: it's a zoo! Interestingly, there are buttons for each section, with which you can unlock all doors. This is not necessary, though, since you can open all but two doors by yourself and kill the monsters one by one and being open to the possibility of the specimens attacking you in group might not be the best of ideas... There are monsters (including medusa and a stone golem) in cages with troll zookeepers guarding them, of which you learn as you advance in the level and kill the creatures, by receiving the messages: On this troll's body you find a crudely drawn map, obviously of this level. In the SE corner is a large, red 'x'. The map also shows an illegible scrawl just NW of this room, marking a location just beyond the cell door... You suddenly realize that the illegible scrawl may have been a warning in trollish... You can see pits behind the creatures. This must be what the Troll keepers use to feed the captive specimens... The trolls, which lurk mainly by the buttons, are important: they carry keys. There is one magically-locked door that cannot be passed without a diamond key; it is in the southeast, and behind is the way up. Any of the trolls might carry a diamond key (it's random); loot each corpse to find the key. There is another troll that carries a steel key (initially at 43,33, but he'll move to you if he sees you), and that key unlocks a door to another area (35,45). You can also find a steel key in one of the medusae in the southwestern cells. If you don't get a troll corpse with a diamond key, there is a diamond key on the floor (36,34). Open the diamond key door (7,45), defeat the fire daemon awaiting you behind it, and go up. As you enter the next level, you're struck with a realization: As the icy air blows by you, freezing the very breath in your lungs, you realize that only the most powerful of magics could sustain the varied environments you have witnessed in this tower... The fourth level is more mundane. It also has a steel key lying around (2,23) and a steel key door (48,43). The key is not necessary, but it's a somewhat shorter path to the Staff piece if you can get it. Go north to get the key, being notified as you approach: You see a small key on the floor of this icy chamber, but other things seem to draw your attention Go back south and go west while hugging the southern wall. Cut north when you have to, then loop back around to the room with the riddle door: To enter within, thou must find, The meaning of this passage... - In a marble hall as white as milk, Lined with skin as soft as silk, Within a fountain crystal clear, A golden apple, doth appear, No doors there are to this stronghold, Yet thieves break in to steal the gold... - What is thy answer? The answer is ""Egg"" or ""An Egg"" and the Staff piece is found within (36,37). Upon answering correctly: Thou may proceed mortal, to thy peril... Answering incorrectly: Too quick with thy answer. Think, and try again... Grabbing the Staff Piece: You attach the fifth piece of the Staff and for a moment feel a surge of energy pass into your body, almost as if the incomplete Staff were a live thing... If you can't find the key, just take the long way around north, then west, then south. Behind the door to the staff piece, you'll encounter two wraiths. Ambush[edit] You will receive yet another ambush from Jagar Tharn, but this time his tone is changed: ""I have underestimated you, that is clear. You have not only defeated the useless creatures I have sent against you, but managed to survive the Crystal Tower, a feat that in and of itself could be legend. It is sad that I am forced to destroy you. Prepare, for my minions arrive..."""

Recover the Hammer of Gharen from Black Gate. Exchange the Hammer for the knowledge of the location of the entrance to Dagoth-Ur. Go to Dagoth-Ur and reclaim the final piece of the Staff of Chaos. Escape Jagar Tharn's ambush.","One Last Night[edit] Go to sleep and Ria Silmane will visit you again, saying: ""I would take no chances, for Tharn has no mercy and will attack the moment he perceives the Staff reassembled. You must be swift. To the northeast lies the fire mountain, Dagoth-Ur. Somewhere in its volcanic depths is the final piece of the Staff of Chaos. The entrance to that fabled mountain has disappeared with the Dwarves that mined it. There may still be those who know of it, however. Find the entrance, enter the volcanic catacombs, and return with the final piece of the Staff. We are so close, I wish you well..."" Ebonheart, Part 1[edit] Asking around about Dagoth-Ur leads you eventually to the palace in Ebonheart, Morrowind. Once there, King Casik, the local ruler, tells you that he does, in fact, have the means to tell you the location of the entrance to Dagoth-Ur. He just needs you to hit the Hammer of Gharen on the Anvil of Mithas. The catch is that while the Anvil is readily available, the Hammer lies somewhere in the depths of a dungeon known as Black Gate. Black Gate[edit] Black Gate, just southeast of Ebonheart, is a two-level dungeon with a large area to explore.  The monsters aren't so bad, but of course be ready for anything. You will encounter Stone Golems, rats, ghouls, homonculi, medusa (bring Potions of Free Action), wraiths, hell hounds and iron golems. This time you won't really need Levitation if you don't want to explore, but bring lots of Potions of Heal True. On the first level, the way down is a bit west of center.  Swim south in the canal just west of the entrance, go west at the first intersecting canal, then go south at the next intersecting canal.  Continue a short way south and go through a hidden door that leads to a short corridor west and into a room.  The way down is just a bit west of that room as the crow flies.  If you have Passwall, you can avoid some monsters and some walking by cutting through the west wall of that room.  Otherwise, go two doors south, two doors west, and find the hidden door north into the monster-filled room, which contains the route down. The Hammer of Gharen The second level is flooded, but also contains a few dry rooms.  You will first have to answer a riddle to have access to the level: This door is sealed tight. A question is carved above it. What answer do you give? - What is the thing which comes in sheets, yet cannot be folded or gathered again? The answer is ""rain"" or ""the rain"", answering incorrectly doesn't carry any consequences. The Hammer resides in a large room in the southwest section.  But while you won't have to answer another riddle to get in, you will have to find one of three keys.  There are three entrances to this room: a ruby key door (92,101), an emerald key door (76,110), and a sapphire key door (101,113).  None are particularly accessible, especially the emerald key door, but all lead to the area containing the Hammer.  The keys themselves are scattered on the level.  The ruby key is on the floor in a small room in the northwest (115,21).  The emerald key is on the floor in a small room in the north central (58,14).  The sapphire key is sometimes unavailable.  When it exists, it is held by an iron golem (99,111).  Fortunately, you needn't get all of the keys.  Any key, once acquired, will get you into the Hammer area through the appropriate door. Your best bet is to see if you can get the sapphire key off the golem, as he is just a short distance south and is guarding a door appropriate to the key he's holding.  To get to the golem, simply walk south after the riddle-door, then pick the western door, walk to the west until you reach the water, and then follow one of the walkways directly south. The Golem is right in front of the door he's guarding. If that fails, the ruby key is probably the easiest to get, and the ruby key door is certainly the easiest door to get to. There is a hidden room in this area, but it is completely empty. Enter the room, defeat the iron golem and fire daemon, and grab the Hammer off its platform (91,117). You have found the legendary Hammer of Gharen. Once it is united with its mate, the Anvil of Mithas in the palace at Ebonheart, it will ring with the location of the secret entrance to Dagoth-Ur... Ebonheart, Part 2[edit] Back at the palace, return with the Hammer so he can strike the Anvil and learn the location of the entrance to the volcano Dagoth-Ur. Before you attempt the final quest, make sure you have several Potions of Heal True, Resist Fire and Shock, and Levitation. Passwall will be of great help in this dungeon as well. Dagoth-Ur[edit] ""The sacred entrance of the Dwarven smiths into the fire mountain, Dagoth-Ur, stands before you. Magical runes glow in the red firelight, shimmering with heat. Sulphurous gouts of steam escape from vents within the rock face of the opening. The final piece of the Staff of Chaos beckons..."" The first level of Dagoth-Ur is a straightforward dungeon crawl. Bring plenty of healing potions and potions of resist fire. Passwall is even more useful than in previous dungeons. As you advance, you are likely to encounter a few messages: You enter the fire mountain, Dagoth-Ur. Around you the air shimmers with heat. Even the stone floor is warm to the touch... - The passages within this volcano are  covered in soot, and the smell of sulphur lingers  everywhere. Be prepared to meet vampires, fire daemons, homunculi, hell hounds, a couple of liches, medusa, stone golems and wraiths. The way down is in the far west center of the level.  The best way to get there is to keep heading west as much as possible.  You will go through a room filled with trenches, then eventually to a lava-filled room with a large crypt in the center: This chamber looks to be some sort of crypt... In that crypt is a vampire who holds a mithril key (83,22).  Beat him down enough to get the key and head for the door in the southwest corner of the room.  Open the magically locked door (92,37) and head south to the way down.  (Having Passwall or the Skeleton's Key means you don't have to deal with the vampire if you don't want to.) This level contains a weird little room in the west you can reach by raised walkway.  What's weird is that when you enter the room, you will still hover above the ground as if you are still on the walkway.  That wouldn't matter if there weren't piles and piles of treasure in the room you can't pick up because you can't get low enough to reach them.  The way to reach them is to cut a hole in the west wall using Passwall and go to the newly revealed floor.  You will descend to the floor, and then you can grab the treasure. The second level is large, and without Skeleton's Key you are required to find at least one key to a magically-locked door; if you don't have Passwall either, you'll have to find four other such keys. If you go questing for such keys, you are likely to find text along the way: This level seems hotter, as if a great fire burns underneath your feet... Gold flecks the hot walls of these passages, lending credibility to the legends of Dwarven wealth beneath.. If you have Skeleton's Key, you can go straight north and open the magically-locked doors one by one, completely avoiding the dungeon crawl. If you have Passwall, you can cut through the walls and avoid the ruby key door (92,30), the sapphire key door (92,27), crystal key door (92,24), and the amethyst key door (92,21).  You cannot Passwall around the diamond key door (92,18); you have to either get the diamond key, cast open spell or use Skeleton's Key. Without the artifact or Passwall, get set for an arduous and dangerous dungeon crawl.  The ruby key is in the northwest behind a lava moat and is guarded by an iron golem (70,19).  Go up the first corridor north and make your way to the room, where you'll find the key on a platform.  The diamond key is in a pit room in the center of the level (46,59).  You can get there by going east then south then east from the lava moat room, traversing a trench room going south, then ducking into a tunnel south till you emerge into the pit room.  You'll know you're there when you hear the lich's scream of outrage at your presence.  The key is on a platform on the south wall of the room.  If you needed only the diamond key, you can go right back the way you came. The sapphire key is northeast of the diamond key in a lava room guarded by a fire daemon (14,20).  Go back the way you came, then when you come out of the tunnel, loop around to the room with the key.  It's on a platform inside the lava rectangle.  The amethyst key is in a room in the southeast corner of the level (18,79).  You can just make your way south through the corridors; as soon as you see a door to the east, take it and you'll find yourself in the right place.  The vampire in that room will try to defend it, so for once you cannot avoid a vampire and will have to fight him.  Fortunately, you can still rest for zero hours when he's down - just like with trolls. The key is on a platform on the center area with the vampire.  The crystal key is in a room in the southwest corner guarded by a medusa (68,80).  The most direct way to it is to swim west in the lava canal that flows east-west along the south of the level.  It might be quicker, though, to avoid the lava and the monsters on the way by arcing up northwest, then south, then through a couple of doors east to the room where the key is.  Grab it off the platform and head back to the magically-locked doors. Once you open the gates to make your way into the Third Level, you will receive another message: As you enter this level a wave of sulphurous air hits you. A roaring sound can be heard, as if some great conflagration lies ahead. The air around you shimmers with heat... The bottom level is fairly simple in concept.  It's mostly a huge lake of lava, in the center of which is the eighth and final Staff piece (50,50). A blast of heat hits you as you stand at the portal to a great lake of fire. Around you occassional fires erupt, then flicker out. In the center of the lake you can just make out some sort of structure... You can actually even get the staff piece without answering a riddle.  However, you cannot get out without answering a riddle: To escape, a riddle must ye answer... - From the beginning of eternity, To the end of time and space, To the beginning of every end, And the end of every place... - What am I? The right answers are: ""e"", ""letter e"", ""the letter e"" and ""an e"". Answering correctly allows you to get out and will result in a commendation for you with a familiar message: Thou art truly worthy. Go in peace, and let thy fate be written in the Elder Scrolls... Answering incorrectly does not have any particularly negative effect, just a more disheartening message: Wrong, mortal. Dagoth-Ur will enjoy  your company, over the millenia [sic]... - you realize with despair that the only  way out is to answer the question correctly In any event, grab the last of the pieces of the Staff of Chaos and flee the dungeon for your last challenge. You have found the last piece of the Staff of Chaos. As though a living thing, it flies to complete the Staff. The whole burns brightly with cold fire and you can feel the strength of this conduit as though it were your own strength... Ambush[edit] After getting the final staff piece and leaving the dungeon, Jagar Tharn sends a minion to kill you and a vision to mock you, because the staff is powerless: ""I congratulate you on your success. Have you discovered however, what I have known all along? The Staff is drained of all magical potential. I did it myself before scattering the pieces across the realm. It is a useless stick, good for churning butter or rowing a boat, but not for saving the Emperor. Come find me if you dare, and I will relieve you of any further burdens you may think to face. My legions await..."""

Deliver the gem to Eldenroot and learn of the location of the Elden Grove. Travel to the Elden Grove and find the third piece of the Staff of Chaos. Survive another attempt at your life by Jagar Tharn.","A Regular Dream Visitor[edit] The next time you sleep after retrieving the second piece of the Staff of Chaos, you will yet again be visited by Ria Silmane. This time, she will say: ""I would congratulate you on retrieving the second piece of the Staff of Chaos, but dire portents have I seen. The third piece of the Staff lies somewhere in the Elden Grove, ancient home of the Elves. The Elden Grove is said to be the birthplace of the sacred First Tree, that which gave life to all the forests on the continent of Tamriel. Its location has been a closely guarded secret, so guarded in fact that many believe that even the Elves have forgotten its true location. Considering that there are only three provinces that hold any of the Elven people, your search should not be too difficult. Find the Elden Grove and recover the third piece of the Staff. I wish you well on your quest..."" Eldenroot, Part 1[edit] Asking around about the Elden Grove leads you eventually to the Eldenroot palace. There, Queen Ulandra implores you for your help in destroying the power of a local sorceress named Selene. If Elden Grove weren't sacred to the wood elves, maybe she'd tell you right off where it was, but since it is, you're going to have to save the wood elves first. When you agree to go, you are provided with the location of Selene's Web and instructions to get the jewel that is the seat of her power. Selene's Web[edit] Upon entering this dungeon, a message will reveal that: This dank, moldy corridor leads into Selene's Web. The smell of wet earth lingers in the air. Selene's Web, another two-level dungeon, is a tiny bit southeast of Eldenroot. ""Web"" is a hint for what you will mainly face down here: spiders. Be sure to bring Potions of Free Action because you will most likely be paralyzed by the eight-legged monsters. A dark, completely optional area of the dungeon is especially populated by a deadly number of the arachnids, but upon coming close, the game will warn you with the messages: MATING DENS! No Light Or Noise! The way down from the first level is southwest of the entrance. Unfortunately, it is blocked by a magically locked door that requires a gold key you must now seek in this level, as pointed out by the messages: Oddly, this small passage bears marks of heavy use. You see a door with a golden lock. This key resides on an island in a large room that is south-southwest of the entrance, signaled by the message: Before you lies a small arena, surrounded by water. Something glitters on the stones of one island. The key is on the northwest island (29,23). The key is more difficult to see as it blends in with the floor tile textures. Get the key, unlock the door (52,29), and go down. (Alternatively, you could merely use Passwall on the wall next to the door. This is one of those rare instances where a magically-locked door can be negotiated without a key.) The second level of the dungeon is a mess of trenches, tunnels, and water. The room where Heart of Selene resides is actually not far away from the entrance to the level; it's just a bit east-southeast. First, take the east trench around to the south, emerge, and head east on the ground level; you'll run into the room quite quickly. However, there's another magically-locked door. Although this one can't be skipped over with Passwall, an Open spell will unlock it. The door will have a message pointing out what you need: The door before you has a diamond studded lock. The Heart of Selene The key is difficult to get. First you have to find it, and that's the hardest part. It's in a very large room in the southeast of the dungeon, past a series of rooms full with spiders, noted as important by the message: DANGER! TRAINING AREA! When entering the room, you will encounter barbarians. If you go to the northwestern corner of the room, you might have to deal with a couple of wraiths. There's a smaller sub-room inside it that has no doors, but the game hints to you that you will have to jump to get in (and you can forget trying Passwall) with another message: There is little dust here, and the footprints that exist are those of humanoids running toward this wall and jumping... To get in, perform a running or standstill jump. Note that you can rest on top of the wall without attracting enemies as it counts as an elevated position. Warning, do not rest if your character is on low health at this position as enemies will kill you easily due to the awkward control scheme. If you happen to get stuck in the wall, perform a standstill jump. After a successful jump, you will then see the key on the floor (20,69). Grab it and jump back over the same way. Now go back to the fortified room, unlock the door (31,40), and grab the Heart of Selene (29,40) to receive the message: You have found the Jewel, the so-called 'Heart of Selene' that will protect the people of Eldenroot. You have only to bring it to the ruler there... Eldenroot, Part 2[edit] Return to Eldenroot Palace and present the jewel to the queen. She then marks the location of the Elden Grove on your continental map. It is in the west of Valenwood. Elden Grove[edit] ""The small overgrown entrance to the Elden Grove stands before you, guarding secrets forgotten for ages. Somewhere within its misty corridors lies the third piece of the Staff of Chaos..."" As you enter, you will also be warned: You enter Elden Grove, chilled by the mists that lend perpetual gloom to this melancholy place. You can hear things shuffling through the overgrowth, and distant growling and moaning that does not sound human at all... The ground level of the Elden Grove is a hazy forest full of monsters and not much treasure. You will not benefit much from a Light spell in this area, as the haze in the forest prevents you from seeing very far. Watch out for the monsters here; they include wraiths which can be particularly dangerous to you at this point in the game. You will soon realize that the Staff piece is not here; it's underneath the Grove. The haziness means you have to feel your way around until you finally find the way down, which is in the far southeast corner of the Grove (9,87). Stay close to the walls in order to map out the area. The fastest way to get to the way down is probably to keep bearing east as much as possible, then go south when you can go east no more. The simplest way to get there is to merely follow the edge of the Grove until you finally get to the way down. Once you get down to the second level, you'll find yourself in more familiar territory: a more ordinary dungeon, or what was once apparently an underground city and is now mostly a flooded hole. There are boats in the water here that can greatly speed your exploration, as they move quite fast. To enter one, simply click on it. To get out of the boat press J (jump). When you get out of a boat, you are advised to mark the location you left it on your map, as they can be hard to see. The closest boat to the entrance to the level is at 58,86, and there are at least four others. Explore until you find the Staff piece—or at least, like always, the riddled door guarding the Staff piece. The fastest way to get there is to head west as soon as you can, then paddle north. You will be presented with the following riddle: Solve who I am by the riddle of this sign, And all good and evil within shall be thine. - My second is performed by my first, And, it is thought, A thief by the marks of my whole, Might be caught. - Who am I? The answers to the riddle can be: footstep, footsteps, foot-step, foot-steps, foot step or foot steps. A correct answer should be accompanied by: Thou hast answered true, so the gate shall be raised. Discover then if thy luck should be cursed or praised. With a wrong answer, instead: I am not that. Thou may return again and again, But this door only opens for the wisest of men. Answer the riddle correctly, enter, and grab the Staff piece (80,19). (As an alternative to answering the riddle, you can actually Passwall your way into the room where the Staff piece is. This is one of the only times where you can avoid having to answer a Staff piece riddle). Once you get the Staff Piece, a message appears: The third piece of the Staff of Chaos melds onto the other two with a low hum. The throbbing of the ebony rod is faster now, as though hungry to be reunited with its brethren... There's one last twist, though. You can't get out the way you got in: the opening on the wall by the trench you fell in cannot be climbed. There's fortunately a door somewhat near the trench, but there's another riddle you have to solve before it will open for you: This hollow shall be your tomb, for there is no other passage out. Should you answer correctly, you are free. Should you not, prepare to join the lost souls of Elden Grove. - Elvish mithril and Argonian silver, crumble I can. But first, I improve all created by man. I devour all things, Bird and beast, serfs and kings, Though my pace is even, men curse my speed, Wishing I were lazier in their hour of need. I can creep and crawl, or rush, even fly. I am all thou hast. Tell me, who am I? The answer for this one is ""Time"", triggering the message: Time is the answer indeed. Consider Elden Grove thy garden. Come and go, at thy will. A wrong answer, however, will trigger another: No, I am not that. You are not free to leave, though when I choose to run out, you will know. I may leave you very soon... Answer the riddle correctly and you can start the long trek back to the entrance. Ambush[edit] Upon your next random monster encounter, Jagar Tharn will send his minions and another vision: ""Why do you choose to align against me when it is obvious that I will destroy you? Even as each piece of the Staff comes into your possession it becomes easier to find you, and I have done just that. Face my creatures, if you dare. I am through toying with you..."""

She will say: ""I see you have strengthened your arm, and your mind. It is time we began this journey. This is the Staff of Chaos, the one item that can open the door between this world, and the dimension to which the Emperor has been banished. Tharn used this item to destroy my corporeal form when I tried to warn the Council. He knew that the Staff of Chaos was nigh indestructable [sic], having been made from the essence of the Land itself. But in that he found the key. As the land is split, so did he shatter the Staff into eight perfectly formed pieces. These he scattered across the realm. I have been able to divine the location of the first piece, a place called Fang Lair."" ""It is said that Fang Lair was originally built by the Dwarves of Kragen. Legend has it that a Great Wyrm drove the Dwarves from their home in the Dragon's Teeth, and took the Lair for itself. I only wish I knew the exact location.

Take care for Tharn may be searching. Go forth with the blessings of the true Emperor, and myself..."" If you reach level 3 but have not slept after reaching level 2,  the next time you sleep, you will only receive the second paragraph of Ria's message. Where Is Fang Lair?[edit] Rihad Ria Silmane told you to find Fang Lair. But as she does not know where it is, it's up to you to find it. You do this by asking passers-by where it is. Some will tell you they've never heard of it; others will say they thought it was just a story. But eventually you will hear that maybe you should check out Hammerfell province. Go there; it's in the west of Tamriel. Once you get to Hammerfell province, continue asking around about Fang Lair. Eventually, someone will tell you to check out Rihad, a city-state in the southern part of the province. Once you get to Rihad, resume questioning the locals about Fang Lair. After a while, someone will tell you to go to the palace. Every palace is found on the city wall; if you have trouble finding it, ask someone for directions and they'll either give you a compass direction or, if you're near enough to it, they'll actually write ""PALACE"" on your map in the appropriate location. Quid Pro Quo, Pt. 1[edit] Talk to the ruler of Rihad, Queen Blubamka. She'll say that she'd love to tell you all about Fang Lair, but first there's the matter of this parchment stolen from her by Golthog the Dark, a goblin chieftain. She can't tell you about Fang Lair unless you take the trouble to bring back this parchment, because, as she claims, the parchment is necessary to help decipher the location of Fang Lair. She is nice enough to mark the location of Golthog's lair on your map: a ruined stronghold called Stonekeep. The stronghold is fairly close to Rihad, and looks like a rock-like cave entrance sticking out of the ground on your world map (right click on the picture of the map to bring up the world map). Before you go, though, you may want to purchase a Potion of Cure Disease. Stonekeep[edit] Stonekeep is a sprawling, single-level dungeon, and like all Arena dungeons is filled with all manner of monsters and plenty of treasure. It features plenty of water to swim in, and in fact you will get wet unless you can levitate. There is an iron key on an island just a bit due south of the entrance (40,30). This key is not essential to getting the parchment. It can, however, open one of several locked doors in the residential area of Stonekeep. Map of Stonekeep. The parchment is located on the island to the left The parchment The parchment is located on a ghoul island hideout southwest of the entrance. The best way to get to it is to walk straight ahead from the entrance and go into the second room on the right, it is to the right of the statue in the middle of the room. (Watch out for rats and wolves at this point). The third bedroom on the right has a hole in the wall which you must jump through using shift + j. After this, turn right and you will face half a dozen skeletons. They are worth decent experience points at this point if you can kill them. You can also lure them back to the hole in the wall and fight them one at a time but keep in mind that they are resistant to edged weapons such as swords. In this room you will notice a large island in the center which is guarded by several ghouls. Then it's a short swim or flight to the ghoul island. The parchment itself is a curly brown piece of paper resting on the ground inside the ghoul hideout (72,23). Be very careful when dealing with the various ghouls on the island; they can be particularly hard to kill for lower level players and carry diseases. You may be better off simply grabbing the parchment and running, though a good amount of loot and experience may be gained looting other areas and specially in the Prison and Royal Bedchamber with their goblins and skeletons. Also keep an eye out for the piles of treasure on the island. When the parchment is in your hands, you will receive the message: You have found the Parchment the court at Rihad can use to discover the location of Fang Lair... Throughout the dungeon, you may find out about the sinister tale of how the Stonekeep passed to the goblins through a series of messages popping up on your screen: A cracked sign, shrouded in dust, reads ""Welcome to Stonekeep. Surrender all weapons to the guards, for we are the keepers of peace."" The dank smell of mold and decay rise from the flooded dungeon... The chest is moldy, as if it had been submerged in water before being brought here. This room, and others nearby, were offices at one time, but looting and decay have left them mere shells... An old faded sign reads ""The king and palace are lost. We, the last survivors of the court of Stonekeep, are heading south through the goblins' caves."" An old faded sign reads ""We are following the goblins' tunnels to the north to make our last stand."" Quid Pro Quo, Pt. 2[edit] Return to Rihad palace with the parchment in your inventory and speak to Queen Blubamka. She will then mark the location of Fang Lair on your map as promised. The lair is the northeast corner of Hammerfell. Before you go to Fang Lair, it is advisable to get a few Potions of Resist Fire, as the dungeon contains both lava and fire-breathing monsters. Also, you might want some Potions of Free Action, as there are creatures there that can paralyze you. Fang Lair[edit] ""You stand before the dragon gate of Fang Lair, humbled before its majesty. The Dwarven Hold seems abandoned long ago, its stone walls cracking with age and neglect. Somewhere within its dank depths lies the first piece of the Staff of Chaos..."" Fang Lair Fang Lair is an abandoned Dwarven mine. You will see tram tracks, trams, enormous holes, trenches and tunnels, and ladders. The trams and tracks are just dungeon dressing, but everything else has to be dealt with, particularly the tunnels. The top level of Fang Lair is quite large, and can be a challenge to explore given all the tunnels, mine shafts enumerated alphabetically from Mine Shaft A to F. Throughout this level you may receive numerous messages on your screen including: You stand in Fang Lair. It's Dwarven hewn passages run for miles under the earth... These tunnels seem to stretch on endlessly, but the tracks you have come across usually lead to the mine shafts... From somewhere near you can hear strange scrapes and clicks... You may also find an interesting walled structure inhabited by spiders and ghouls where a statue and some loot can be found. Curiously, coming near this place triggers the message: You see a temple, a structure nearly as ancient as the rock from which it was hewn ... You will have to traverse the tunnels to reach the ladder down to the second level of Fang Lair (unless you have the Passwall spell at your disposal). You can find this ladder in the extreme southwest part of the level. To reach the ladder, however, you have to pass a magically locked door, and to get the key to that door, you need to correctly answer the first of many puzzles and riddles you will encounter throughout the main quest. This one is intended to be a logic puzzle. First you receive a warning: The cage puzzle room You come upon a strange sight. A room with cells down either side. In each cell seems to be a hungry spider. You see three more cells along the southern wall. Next to them stands a dark portal... As you approach the ""portal"" (the magically locked door), you receive another warning: Thou must prove thy worthiness to proceed to the Underdark. The correct answer will open the cell to the gold key, which will open the portal. - Rush not to answer mortal. The wrong choice will open the cell doors to the spiders... Finally, at the portal, you receive the riddle itself: As you near, the door itself speaks: - Listen to my puzzle, foolish mortal and prove that you are worthy of my service... - If Cell 3 holds worthless brass, Cell 2 holds the gold key. If Cell 1 holds the gold key, Cell 3 holds worthless brass. If Cell 2 holds worthless brass, Cell 1 holds the gold key. - Knowing this brave fool, and knowing that all that is said cannot be true, which cell contains the gold key? You are only given three options, so if you get it wrong, you can try again and you will eventually get it. Note, however, that if you get it wrong, the spiders in the cages you just passed will find themselves free to open their doors and come after you. The correct answer are: 2, cell 2, cell2, the second cell, the 2nd cell and c2. A correct answer is confirmed by the following message: Thou art correct mortal. The key within cell 2 is yours... On the other hand, a wrong answer results in another message... You hear the groan of metal as the cell doors that hold the spiders unlock, and open... Your answer will unlock one of three different cage doors just to the west of you, and in fact will open the cage corresponding to the number you guess (walk in front of the cages and a note will pop up telling you which is which). In each cage is a key you can use to open either the magically locked door in front of you or one of the magically locked doors just north of the spider cages. Those doors lead to cages that hold piles of treasure (95,78; 91,78). The idea is to unlock the cage containing the gold key. One strategy is to give the two wrong answers before giving the correct answer to ensure easy access to the treasure keys; note that of course by doing so you will have to deal with the spiders. If you have Passwall, you can have your cake and eat it, too: just open the correct cage first, then use Passwall to destroy the walls leading to the other keys. Once you obtain the gold key (94,98), open the magically locked door (88,96) and take the ladder down to the second level. The first staff piece is behind a locked door A piece of the Staff of Chaos In the center of this level is a room with a door locked by a riddle: A simple question for thee, - What is neither fish nor flesh, feathers nor bone, But still has fingers, and thumbs of its own? - What is thy answer, mortal? The riddle has a number possible correct answers: gauntlet, gauntlets, glove, gloves, a glove and a gauntlet. The room is almost impossible to miss, as this level is not large in area and there isn't a lot to look at. Answer the riddle to unlock the door to get to a couple of fire-breathing hell hounds and the first Staff Piece (64,75). Upon answering correctly, you'll receive the message: Thou hast truly the wit to continue. Thou may proceed... A wrong answer results in another message: Thou art wrong mortal. Think carefully before thou ventures another reply... The hell hounds can cause a lot of damage, especially if you are a low level. To avoid their attack, you can open the door and immediately take cover behind the wall. After a few seconds they will vanish. Sometimes they won't vanish, a good strategy is to use an invisibility spell to get close to them so they don't use their long range attack (which is their most powerful attack). When the First Staff Piece within this room is recovered, you'll receive the message: The first piece of the Staff of Chaos flashes once before turning to a dull piece of ebony in your hand. You can feel it perceptibly throbbing as if waiting to be connected to the other seven pieces... Ambush[edit] After collecting the staff piece, you may soon be greeted by a vision from Jagar Tharn, who is using the same power Ria is to talk to you.  This may occur any time a random monster encounter might occur. This may be while camping outside or in dungeons, or anytime in the wilderness or while wandering the city streets at night. ""I do not know who you are, but you have made a fatal mistake. Ria Silmane and her feeble powers are no protection for you. I should have discorporated her when I had the chance. I will not make the same mistake again. I will use the same dream bridge that she uses, sending my minions across time and space. Already they arrive, ones worthy of the attention you deserve. They will relieve you of the burden of the Staff piece you now hold. Give it to them and I will order your death painless and quick. Resist and I shall see you in such suffering that you will grovel for the sweet release of death..."" After the vision has ended you will be attacked by one of his minions."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Arena:Halls_of_Colossus","Go to sleep and be visited again by Ria Silmane. Travel to the Mages Guild in Corinth, Elsweyr. Go to the Temple of Agamanus and retrieve a stone tablet. Return the tablet to the Mages Guild in return for the location of the Halls of Colossus. Travel to the Halls of Colossus and recover the fourth piece of the Staff of Chaos. Survive an attack from Jagar Tharn's minions.","Go to Sleep[edit] As before, go to sleep and see Ria Silmane in your dreams. She will say: ""You have done well. I had thought you lost to me. The third piece of the Staff is yours. Rumors have been whispered about in the Empire. I think Tharn senses that the pieces come together. You must take care to not be discovered by him-your death would be most unpleasant. I have divined the location of the fourth piece of the Staff. It lies in the Halls of Colossus, a structure built to honor a race of Giants, though none have been seen in the land for ages. It is said that the Halls of Colossus sat perched on a cliff overlooking the Great Divide, which is along the southern edge of Tamriel. Perhaps the Halls are near that coastline. I only wish I could offer you more. Fare thee well my friend, and find this place, for the sake of our loved ones..."" Corinth, Part 1[edit] Asking around about the Halls of Colossus leads you eventually to the Mages Guild in Corinth, Elsweyr.  There, the Loremaster of the guild, Turamane ap' Kolthis tells you that they used to have a tablet that would help decipher the location of the Halls of Colossus. They were recently attacked and the tablet was stolen and taken to the Temple of Agamanus.  Most unfortunately, the battle over the tablet left the Guild in a weakened state, too weak to go get it back.   If you agree to go retrieve the tablet, the location of the Temple of Agamanus is marked on your map. Temple of Agamanus[edit] The temple, located just south of Corinth, is a tri-level dungeon.  The levels are not large, but each contains a good amount of treasure.  The temple is full of flame-throwing monsters and other assorted ill-wishers. You may want to bring some Potions of Resist Fire, because this place is crawling with hell hounds. Also, it could be a good idea to use the opportunity to collect treasures; all levels have a lot. There are several locations that will give you an exploration note that states; ""A sign over the stairs reads: Private! Members Only!"" These are not necessarily near the stairs, but are intended to help direct you to them. Upon entering, you will receive a message: AGA  NU W LCO  S PI GRIMS You will also be attacked by a group of knights nearly instantaneously upon entering the dungeon. After defeating these initial enemies, the following message appears near one of them: You find a note on this Knight's body, - You will hold this fortress until my return. Guard the treasures well, or forfeit your life... Sir Galandir... - Other such messages may pop up in the dungeon, including: The stench of decaying food fills the air. A damp, musty odor fills this area. The floor here is oddly patterned... On the first level, the way down is in the southwest corner of the dungeon.  The dungeon has a normal layout, so just head south and west and you'll get there.  There are many small rooms in the very south of the first level which contain easy treasure along with a warning: Clearly some kind of unpleasant rituals were planned for this chapel... On the second level, you enter in the southwest and the stairway down is in the north center.  The way is indirect.  If you don't have Passwall, you'll initially find yourself threading a little maze and the message: A small plaque advises: BEAR LEFT - STAY RIGHT When you emerge, you can then head more or less directly to the way down. A tablet On the third level, you enter in the north center, and the tablet is in the southwest.  Passwall can be a big help, as can Levitate.  Without Passwall, the way is tortuous, and you will have to do some always-dangerous swimming to get where you want to go. There is a very common issue where you cannot pass a crossing point in the water near the room with the tablet. This is caused by a ghost hovering over the water in an attempt to reach you, blocking you and also preventing you from swimming out from under the overhang. If you encounter this, you can pass through by using passwall to create a path around. If you are not a spellcaster then simply find a weapon at any town that contains the passwall spell as an enchantment. You can also save and reload while directly under the monster, which might change its position and allow you to pass. Another solution is to take the water path into the room from the east. When you get to the room with the tablet you'll face the obligatory riddle: Answer this riddle and proceed into this vault, - I daily am in Elsweyr, and in Skyrim, At times do all the world explore, Since time began I've held my reign, And shall till time is never more. I never in my life have strolled In garden, field, or park, Yet all of these are sad and cold If I'm not there and it is dark... - Answer? Answer with ""sun"" or ""the sun"", grab the tablet (46,38), and make the long trip back out to Corinth. Nothing happens if you answer incorrectly. A correct answer results in the message: You have spoken well. Enter... Upon taking the tablet, you will be informed that: You have found the Tablet Sir Galandir stole from Turamane ap'Kolthis of the Corinth Mages' Guild. When Turamane has it again he can use it to find the location of the legendary Halls of Colossus... Corinth, Part 2[edit] Back at the Mages Guild, hand in the tablet for your reward: the location of the Halls of Colossus. Halls of Colossus[edit] ""You stand before the gigantic walls of the Halls of Colossus, built by giants in an age long past. The wind echoes mournfully through the empty battlements. Here lies the fourth piece of the Staff of Chaos..."" The first level of the Halls of Colossus is a very large dungeon that is strewn with keys, and of course monsters.  The keys open magically-locked doors on the second level.  Obviously, the idea is to hunt for the keys so as to get by all the second-level doors. However, by using passwall on the walls around the locked doors it is possible to completely skip this intended portion of the dungeon and run through the Halls in minutes. When first entering, there are two introductory messages. The first is as follows: You enter the secret passage to the Hall of Colossus. The floor here is covered in a fine mold, scratched by large, sharp claws, and the air is warm and moist. The second is intended to be found on the body you see right at the entrance.  However, the message only appears when standing directly next to it.  It's possible to loot the body from a distance and turn left or right and never receive the message. The map mentioned is not an actual item, but the directions can lead you to the gold key: ""On this body you find a hastily scribbled note. It speaks of finding six keys to unlock the secret the Halls [sic]. These keys according to a crude map seem to be scattered about this level. A red  'X' is scribbled on a spot directly north of here. The monsters on the first level are not too difficult, but the ones on the third level can be more challenging. Monsters include ghouls, skeletons, rats, and a few hell hounds. These monsters are on all levels except the third and last one, where there are mostly skeletons and homonculi (you may want to have a few Potions of Shock Resistance on hand). If you can handle ghouls and zombies, then you should be ready to complete the quest. The easiest keys to get are the gold and iron keys.  The gold key is on a raised surface just north of the entrance (8,27).  The iron key is on a raised surface west-southwest of the entrance (27,58). The remaining keys are harder to get.  If you do not have Passwall, you will have to go down to the second level and take the stairs up to enter a section of the dungeon you couldn't otherwise get to.  Take the closest way down (32,52). The second level is a huge, empty hall (empty except for rats, that is). Upon entering, you are warned of this: The dead air in the Hall of Colossus is dry and stinks of decay. In the quietude of the chamber, you can hear the scuffling of many feet. Red eyes stare out at you from the gloom... Assuming you went down the aforementioned door, the magically-locked doors are directly in front of you to the west.  If you have the iron and gold keys in hand, you can go unlock them if you wish, although you don't need to yet.  More to the point are the other six doors heading up:  three on the north, three on the south.  The eastmost and northeast doors lead to the first section of the first level; the one you're in when you first enter.  The other doors lead to widely-spaced ways up behind the wall that separates the two sections.  The quickest way to the next key is to go through the door in the southeast (37,68). The sapphire key is on some stairs just north-northwest of where you came up (42,51).  You can from there quickly travel southeast and pick up one of two amethyst keys on a raised area at (22,74).  There's another one, though, so you can skip this one if you wish.  Either way, there's a flooded area in the extreme southeast that you should explore; there's an inscription you would do well to read (7,76) There is an inscription engraved here on the moss-caked stone - Theodorus. From there it's a long swim along the south wall to get to the raised area on which sits the ruby key (69,83). The two remaining keys are in the far north section, a very long way away from the south section of the dungeon.  You can either make your way there while remaining on the first level, or you can go down to the second level and come up in a closer location.  Going down is recommended because it is more direct.  If you do go down, pick either the north central or northwest door to re-emerge on the first level.  If you don't want to go back down, make your way back to where the sapphire key was and swim west under the walls. The diamond key is on the floor in an area by a very large pit (72,9).  First unlock a gate north of the pit, then open a door on the west wall and enter a room that is outlined in gray on the map; the key is in the corner of the room.  The other amethyst key is on a raised platform a tiny bit southwest of it as the crow flies, but you can't get there directly without Passwall.  If you haven't already gotten it, make your way around by heading west, then south and back north (79,16). Now you're done with the first level.  Go down to the second level, open the magically-locked doors (78,52; 82,52; 86,52; 89,52; 93,52), and go down to the third level. You have one key left: use it to open the first door (94,57).  The next door presents you with a riddle: I am the architect of this hell, whose name is forgot in the dust of time. Yet, where there is no dust, where the river would speak, there is my name. Find this place and then return, to tell me my name. Only then shall you pass this door. What is my name? Upon answering correctly by writing ""Theodorus"", you are commended with the words: Theodorus, Theodorus is my name. Pass, child, and beware the halls ahead. Failure prompts chastising instead: That is not my name. The wisest man would never guess it. Search these hallowed halls, Make yourself clean, Murder that which is dead, then give me the name that is true. Although not your typical riddle, if you explored the first level thoroughly and remember what you saw in the southeast flooded area, you will be able to answer it (the answer is the name of the architect, Theodorus).  If you have Passwall, you can avoid the door and the riddle altogether.  Either way, make your way to the main door.  Inside is a puzzle: Answer me this, and prove thy wit, for a true challenge is rare indeed. I am twice as old as three times the age of the Sphinx of Gazia, Agamamnus [sic], divided by one-ninth the age of the Sphinx of Canus, Igon, who left this world twenty-six years ago. What then is my age? Solve it using the sum of the index of letters in the alphabet for the age of each name (for example, Igon is 9+7+15+14=45). (The answer to the riddle is 108, hundred and eight and one hundred and eight) to enter the room containing the Staff piece (70,51). Answering correctly pops up the message: You are free to enter, child. But be warned - there be devils within. Otherwise, you receive: Impudent child, you may not enter ... But you may join those who came before. You should heed the warning upon answering correctly, as Homunculus with powerful shock attacks fill the area surrounding your prize, though they can be avoided at the cost of the various treasures they guard. Upon entering the next room, another warning is triggered: Pedestals hang in the air in this room, defying all laws. Your senses are alert to the acrid stench of brimstone and to the whirring of leathery wings... If you want to get out of there as quick as possible, run straight forward (east) and a little south to pick up the staff piece, displaying the message: The fourth piece of the Staff of Chaos fastens itself to the other three in a flash of blue light. The Staff is now half complete... Ambush[edit] Upon your next random monster encounter, Jagar Tharn sends a minion and a vision: ""It is obvious, whoever you are, that you are a cunning and worthy foe. It seems that Ria chose well, even if it was her last act. I will not insult your intelligence with further digression. My minions soon approach, but I will not consign you to the dark door of Death. You have proven your worth. Once you are killed, I will raise you to fight for me, as one of my servants. Give in to me now and I offer you everlasting life..."" Notes[edit] It's possible to avoid traversing the first level of the dungeon for all the keys. If you have the Skeleton's Key artifact, just go down to the lower levels and open the doors using the artifact. If you have a spell or magic item with Passwall, you can proceed by removing the wall next to each door; including the one with the first riddle. You can bypass the final riddle by getting over the wall between you and the staff piece. In the secret room just to the north, jump on the elevated tiles (86,39) and then use a Running Jump to reach the top of the east wall. You may need an increased strength stat in order to make the jump and you should save first; in case you get stuck in the wall. After collecting the staff piece, the door will still be magically locked, and you won't receive the riddle from the inside.  In order to exit the area, you must make your way back on top and over the wall.  There are many options and the elevated platform at (78,30) can provide a first step. The Halls of Colossus can be found in the Lore section for more information and references in future games."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Arena:Imperial_Dungeons_(quest)","Listen to your deceased friend's story. Reach the Shift Gate in the southwest corner of the map to escape the prison. Answer the Shift Gate's question correctly to leave the prison (floppy disc version only).","In a Dream[edit] Your starting point: The Imperial Dungeons (the room shaped like a boot to the right, the green dot is the shift gate, located at the bottom left) First you see a cutscene in which the ethereal form, Ria Silmane, appears to you in your dream. She will tell you of how she died and how you are now the only person she can send on this quest. ""Do not fear for it is I, Ria Silmane. (Player's name), listen to me, there are no others left to carry on this fight. You have been left in this cell to die. Jagar Tharn, Imperial Battlemage of Tamriel has taken on the guise of the true Emperor. He does not see you as a threat, being only a minor part of the Imperial Court. In that act of arrogance, he has made his first mistake. Look to the north wall of this cell. You will find a ruby key which will unlock the door. Take it and make your escape. The passages here were once used by Tharn to hide treasures he had stolen from the Emperor's coffers. If you wish, you can gather enough to support yourself away from the Imperial Seat. Be careful, there are many creatures which inhabit the sewers now, vile rats and goblins."" ""It is too late for me, for I am already dead. Only my powers as a Sorceress keep me between this life and the next. That power however is waning. Do not succumb to greed or you may find these tunnels to be your final resting place as well. I can still work my magic to a certain extent. If you travel west from this cell, then south, you will find a Shift Gate. It will transport you far enough from the center of the Empire that you should be safe. If you survive these sewers you will see me again. Remember, (Player's name), Tharn has taken on the guise of the Emperor. No one will gainsay his word for yours. I will come to you again in your dreams, so it is imperative that you rest from time to time. In that way I will be able to communicate with you and lend my aid. You are entering a dangerous arena, my friend, one in which the players are beings beyond your mortal comprehension. I do not envy your role. There is however a power within you as yet untapped. Look for me when you have gained experience in the world. You are my last and best hope."" A key When the cutscene ends, you will find yourself in a locked jail cell. There is a ruby key (which looks more yellow than red or ruby) at the far corner of the cell on a raised platform (3,19). The key can be a little difficult to pick up. Make sure your cursor is right on top of it or just slightly below and that there is nothing else in the way. If that fails, move around a bit and try again. Try to keep the position of the key in the center of your screen. Once you have the key, use it to open the cell door (4,21).  Go West, then South[edit] Those were the directions Ria Silmane gave you. As you exit your cell, you will see a pile of loot. Click on the pile. It is a standard treasure pile, one that you will see in nearly every dungeon. It contains a random amount of gold and some random equipment. Before you move on, go into your inventory and equip any weapon that you currently have and are able to use. Here, you can either run for the exit, or explore further. The creatures that can be found here are goblins, rats, and sometimes even lizard men, but there is quite a lot of loot. You will not be able to return here once you pass through the Shift Gate. If you do want to make a run for it, simply keep going west, then turn south, then west, then south, (and so on) until you reach the Shift Gate. The Shift Gate[edit] As you run down the final long and narrow corridor, you will see a glowing, blue-rimmed Shift Gate. Once you reach it, you will be asked a question. You must get it right to exit the prison and be teleported to a different city. The question will look like this: What is the spellcasting cost of __________? where the blank is filled by a random spell. Originally, you were supposed to look in the Arena Manual that came with the box to find the correct answer; see the notes for how to access the answers. When you answer it correctly, you will be teleported to a random city in the province your character hails from. Congratulations! You have escaped! Note: If you have version 1.07 of Arena (CD version with voice acted cutscenes for Ria Silmane, Jagar Tharn, etc. as well as many other minor changes), or one of the later releases, then you will not be asked any questions. You can simply step through the shift gate and you will be transported to your home province."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Arena:The_Imperial_Palace","Travel to the Imperial City in the Imperial Province and infiltrate the palace. Reach the bottom palace dungeon and battle Jagar Tharn for the Jewel of Fire. Touch the Staff of Chaos to the Jewel of Fire to release its power and bring back the Emperor.","Imperial Palace[edit] Thanks to Jagar Tharn taunting you, you realize that to finish the job you've started, you'll have to go to the Imperial Palace and beat him. The Imperial Palace is located in the Imperial City, which is in the center of the continent. When you arrive at the Imperial City, head due south and keep going until you can go no further: that's the palace.  Click on it to enter, but make sure you save before entering. You will not be able to exit the palace once you've entered. The palace is for the most part a straight dungeon crawl. There are quite a few more monsters than in any other dungeon, and they are many more of the very tough ones, such as liches and vampires. You'll want to bring plenty of Magic Items and potions, but this time bring twice as many Potions of Heal True as you had in the last dungeon, and try to save at least half of them for the fourth level. Potions of resist shock will also be very useful when facing the liches on the fourth level. You will find that the first level is already mapped out for you and there are three ways down. One is in the northwest corner, another is in the northeast corner, and there is one close to the entrance in the west central section. As you enter you will immediately have fireballs shot at you from at least two wraiths. Using a potion of resist fire, or some other method of reducing the damage, and charging straight at them is the easiest way of dealing with them. The rest of the first floor isn't particularly difficult. If you have Passwall, you can cut through the bedroom walls to the west of the throne room pools and quickly get down to the next level. If you do not, it's a slightly longer journey to the way down. The northwest way down is the easiest to get to, but if you want the quickest way down, you're better off looping around to the west to get to the west central way down. On this level, you'll face mostly warriors and wraiths. On the second level, if you took the west central way down, you will find a way down that is very close to you. Immediately head east, then north through the first door. There is another way down in the southeast corner. On the third level, there are two ways down along the west wall, both pretty much central on the north-south axis.  The easier one to get to is the north one: go north at the first corridor, go west through the next two doors, and go down. Be prepared to encounter lots of iron golems. On the fourth and final level, if you have Passwall, you can avoid running a gauntlet of liches if you wish. Head as far south as you can go, then cut through the wall south and east till you see an east-west corridor (you may have to loop a bit back west). Otherwise, you'll have to head north, then east, then south, then back west through that last corridor, fighting a veritable horde of liches and a few other miscellaneous monsters. But no matter what you do, you will have to kill at least four liches, two at a time. The end of the main quest Go through the door at the west end of that last corridor. Tharn has outfitted the bottom of his palace with a lake of lava to protect the Jewel of Fire, which is sitting in a cell on an island in the center of the lake. The Jewel's cell door is magically locked and needs a mithril key to open it. You can open the Jewel cell without delay if you have the Skeleton's Key. If you don't have Skeleton's Key, you can find the mithril key on a platform (26,25). That is in the northwestern room of the island (hit the door with a weapon to open). The safest and quickest way to finish the game now is to use Levitation and run as fast you can to the island. Ignore Jagar Tharn as you run straight to the northwestern room, hit the door a few times, get the key and run for the gem in the northeastern room. If the furious mage happens to block your way out of the key-room, use Passwall to get past him. Tharn will hurl all manner of magic at you to try to stop you, and you can fight him if you like, but ultimately the Jewel is what matters; you can't kill him because...well, you'll see. If you do manage to drain him to the point he can no longer battle, you can loot him for the mithril key as well. Open the mithril key door (21,24) and take the Jewel of Fire (20,24) which will cause Jagar Tharn to die.  (Be sure to save before taking the Jewel, as the game will sometimes freeze when loading the final cutscene).  Enjoy the closing cutscene. Jagar Tharn: ""You must not! The jewel holds my lifeforce!!!"" Emperor Uriel Septim VII: """"Thou art a true child of the Empire. I thank thee for thy assistance. I have a particular idea as to the question of your service in mind... From this day forth, thou art named Eternal Champion. From thy hand shall be dealt the needs of the Empire. I, Uriel Septim, true Emperor of Tamriel do decree, and thus make law. Arise my Champion, and take thy rightful place at my side..."" Afterwards, you will be greeted by the following text: """"You have proven yourself a worthy champion of the Empire, and such service shall not be easily forgotten. Hang not your sword above the mantle, nor place your spellbook upon the shelves. Many such adventures still await your hand. This was but a chapter in the story of the Elder Scrolls..."""
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Arena:Labyrinthian","Receive yet another vision from Ria Silmane in your dreams. Travel to the Mages Guild in Winterhold, Skyrim. Infiltrate the Fortress of Ice to recover a magical tablet. Return the tablet to the Mages Guild and learn of the location of the Labyrinthian. Go to the Labyrinthian and retrieve the second piece of the Staff of Chaos. Survive yet another attempt made on your life by your enemy.","Yet Again, in a Dream[edit] After you retrieve the first piece of the Staff of Chaos, Ria Silmane will appear to you in your dreams yet again, the next time you sleep. This time, she will say: ""It seems that you were well chosen. I see that you have won the first piece of the Staff. That in and of itself is not a simple task. Tharn, it seems, is not as concerned with you as I had thought he would be. Perhaps he thinks you dead or lost in the sewers from which you escaped. That is well, for I have discovered the second piece's location. There was once a great maze, built by the Archmagus Shalidor to guard what he called Glamorill, the elven term for 'The Secret of Life'. I know not the location of the great maze, which was called the Labyrinthian, but somewhere in its twisted corridors lies the second piece of the Staff of Chaos. Shalidor, according to the old texts, made his home in the Fortress of Ice. He would not have built the Labyrinthian far from his home. I would search to the north for such a place. I wish you well on your journey..."" Winterhold, Part 1[edit] Asking around about the Labyrinthian leads you eventually to the Winterhold Mages Guild.  The leader of the Guild, Thelen Kaarn, tells you that while they'd like to help you, some rogue knights made off with a stone tablet that would complete a map to the Labyrinthian.  Also, because you're the only one who cares, you're the only one who's going to get it back.  When you agree to go, you are provided with the location of the Fortress of Ice.  It's just a bit southwest of Winterhold. Fortress of Ice[edit] This is a two-level dungeon teeming with cold monsters and humans in what must be rather cold suits of armor.  The way down to the second level is actually quite close to the entrance to the fortress itself, but unless you have Passwall, you'll have to go through a maze-like set of rooms and corridors to get to it. A word of caution to melee classes: you will need at least an Elvish weapon to be able to defeat any Ice Golems you meet, so make sure you pick something tasty up before heading off on this quest. Even with a proper weapon, Ice Golems can take and deal significant damage before falling, making Invisibility a useful tool for evading most of them. The constant Snow Wolves will likely be the first spellcasters you face in quantity. While their ice spells can quickly destroy unprepared characters, they can be made trivial with the application of Spell Absorption. Light is another helpful spell for the Fortress of Ice, as without it the ranged enemies will often exploit your limited view distance to attack you from the shadows. When you enter, if you immediately hug the west wall, by the time you turn the corner you'll see the blue square that signifies the way down.  This is a huge help if you have Passwall, and a big help even if you don't: it saves a lot of searching for the way down.  Make your way to it, doing your best not to be frozen by snow wolves or swatted down by ice golems and humans. A tablet The second level of the fortress is also a maze-like set of corridors and rooms.  You start in the east central part of the level, and the tablet is in the northwest part of the dungeon.  Again, Passwall is a big help if you have it; otherwise, be prepared for a long crawl and lots of monsters.  If you don't have Passwall, you'll initially have to go south and traverse some tunnels before you can make your way to the section of the dungeon in which the tablet resides.  Once you get there, you will be presented with a riddle: I touch your face,       I'm in your words,       I'm lack of space,     And beloved of birds...          What am I? The riddle has some possible correct answers: ""air"", ""the air"", ""wind"" or ""the wind"". Once you get in, grab the tablet (43,3).  It's lying on the floor.  Bring it back to Winterhold. Upon grabbing the tablet, you should receive this message: You have found the Tablet that Thelen Kaarn spoke of. Once he has hold of it, he can use it to decipher the location of the Labyrinthian... Winterhold, Part 2[edit] Back in the Mages' Guild, present the tablet to Thelen Kaarn.  He then marks the location of the Labyrinthian on your map, in the north central part of Skyrim. Before heading to Labyrinthian however, you may want to stock up on potions and prepare yourself mentally for a long and excruciating dungeon. Labyrinthian[edit] ""Stubborn grass and roots stand in the stiff arctic clime, refusing to yield. Ahead of you stands the entrance to the Labyrinthian, testing ground of the Archmagus Shalidor. Within its twisted paths lies the second piece of the Staff of Chaos..."" Labyrinthian is a very large and tortuous dungeon.  It is chock-full of raised walkways, trenches, and tunnels.  On your dungeon map, the raised areas and the tunnels are the same color, so it can be difficult to tell which way to go even when you look at the map.  You may think the path you're taking is good, but then you'll be dead-ended because where a walkway ends, a tunnel below you keeps going, and there will be no easy way to get to the tunnel from where you are.  In short, it's a frustrating dungeon to navigate. The first thing you see on the first level is a series of three cage-like doors along with the message: Proceed along the center path first, for the clues to solving the secrets of the Labyrinthian await there... If you go through the middle door, you'll get a dungeon back story and an idea of your first task: to obtain the key to a magically locked door.  You are told that to get that key, go down into the lower level via the first door. The back story reads as follows: This is the tale of two brothers,   who sought the secret of life.   They ventured into this Labyrinthian,   weary from war and strife... The first was Kanen the Elder,   a strong and cunning man.   He quested for riches and jewels,   yet found Fate had other plans... The second was Mogrus the Dim,   and few knew what he was worth.   They saw only the lumbering giant,   not the child who was blessed at birth... The few they told of their plans,   begged them to desist at their feet.   But the brothers would test this puzzle to the North,   for till then they had known no defeat... This is the tale of two brothers,   who failed the secret of life.   Forever held by two riddles which lead to the prize,   and a wit as cunning, and sharp as a knife... The first locked door door you find denying you access to the Staff Piece will display a message: Mogrus the Dim, though he's a bore, Holds the only key that unlocks this door. To find the riddle, you must first find the son, Start your fateful search behind door number one... So, the first objective is getting a key from Mogrus's wraith in the second level. It's not particularly easy to get to the lower level.  The Labyrinthian lives up to its name.  However, if you go through the first door and go northeast, you will quickly see on your dungeon map the blue dot that signifies the way down.  Make your way to it and go down to the second level of the dungeon into the Domain of Mogrus as indicated by a message right before the entry. You can find Mogrus's key in the northeast corner of the dungeon.  The best method to get there is to find the raised walkway running north-south on the eastern side and stick to it going north, jumping over trenches and tunnels if need be.  When you get to his room, there are two cages: one holds the key, the other holds Mogrus (or at least what's left of him after all these years).  You'd like to just grab the key and not have to deal with Mogrus, but of course there's a riddle first: I am brother Mogrus, the shade of this hall, Cursed to its lengths, from beginning to end. Find me the answer, and a door will I call  Fail me but once, and your heart will I rend... -    More beautiful than the face of your God,  Yet more wicked than a Daemon's forked tongue?          Dead men eat it all the time,         Live men who eat it die slow... -          What is the answer, mortal? The correct answer is ""nothing"". Mogrus responds friendly but cryptically to a correct answer before vanishing: I have been a fool, Perhaps a mad wizard's tool. Yet after untold ages,  I am at last free. In the cell next to this lies your reward, the Diamond Key... A wrong answer results in Mogrus' Wraith form turning hostile along with the words: Curse you for a fool, And now taste my wrath... The two cages are magically locked. Answering the riddle correctly will unlock the cage door behind which lies the key.  Answering incorrectly will unlock the door to the cage where Mogrus resides; and he's a tough fight.  Even if you manage to defeat him, you still have to eventually get the riddle right or the other door will not unlock for you.  Once you get the door unlocked, grab the diamond key (10,12) and make your way back up to the first level. Go back through the middle door (50,45) and use the key to unlock the first magically locked door (50,16). Once you do that, make your way around to the next door. You are then told of a new objective: Kanen the wise, holds more to be seen, a key and a riddle, and a test in between. To get past this portal, a feat done by few, search for the brother behind door number two... To get by this magically locked door, you'll have to go through door 2 on the current level and make your way down yet again to the second level. The way down to the Domain of Kanen is the same distance and angle from the entrance as Mogrus's, except it is southwest and not northeast (it's mirrored, if the mirror is on a y-axis in the center).  It's a little harder to find than Mogrus's, but it's not far and is similarly indicated as Kanen's right before entering.  Make your way to it and re-enter the second level, but this time down to the Domain of Kanen. (By this time you may notice that Mogrus's domain takes up the east half of the dungeon and Kanen's takes up the west half.  Never the twain shall meet, not even with Passwall.) Kanen and his key are in the southwest corner of the dungeon.  You can reach it by raised walkway or by tunnel.  Your best bet is to take raised walkways south and west as much as possible.  The shortest path will take you a short way through a trench.  His setup is exactly like his brother's:  he's in a cell, the key is in a cell next to him, and you have to solve a riddle to open it: I am the brother Kanen, who holds the secret of life. Not a more cunning riddler, 'twixt ocean and fief. Answer me this question, o' foolish mortal from above, or join my eternal task, borne of duty and love... -                  Two bodies have I,               Though both joined in one.                 The more still I stand,                  The quicker I run... -                  What is thy answer? The correct answer is ""hourglass"" or ""an hourglass"".  Get the sapphire key (84,92) and use it to open the corresponding door on the first level (50,6). A correct answer is accompanied by the message: I am free to fly the wind, after an eternity of sickness and sin! As a reward for setting me free, The cell next to this holds your Sapphire Key... A wrong answer instead causes the same results as with Mogrus along with a different message: Thou are wrong mortal, now your soul will I take for eternity... Again, make your way around the wall to the other side where there sits the door between you and the Staff piece.  As is Jagar Tharn's tendency, there is a riddle for you to answer first: Here lies the final portal, the doorway to life... - What force and strength cannot get through, I, with a gentle touch, can do; And many in these twisted halls would stand, Were I not, as a friend, at hand... - Answer? The correct answer is ""key"" or ""a key"" and upon answering with either you receive this message: Thou art truly worthy of Shalidor's prize, the second piece of the Staff of Chaos awaits... A wrong answer, this time without major consequences, instead reads: Thou hast answered in haste, and truly erred... Answer the riddle and collect your prize (50,9). Upon taking the staff piece, a message pops up: The second piece of the Staff of Chaos burns brightly with cold fire as it touches the first piece. They meld together perfectly... Ambush[edit] Your next random monster encounter will bring you your second ambush and vision from Tharn: ""You have survived the tests most dire. Continue along this path however and you will face such things as to make your very heart freeze. I will save you the ordeal for my servants approach you even now. From your managled corpse I will take what is mine..."""

Repel an attack by Jagar Tharn's minions.","Sleep, yet Again[edit] As usual, go to sleep and Ria Silmane will visit you. This time, she says: ""Tharn is livid, scattering about the Imperial Palace like a rabid dog. You have caused him no end of worry. I am sure the Wizard's minions are tracking you. I will say no more, lest I tempt Fate. You seek now the seventh piece of the Staff of Chaos. I have found that this piece lies in a place called Murkwood, the dark forest that ever moves. There can only be one of two provinces left that can hold this forest, Black Marsh or Morrowind. I would start my search in one of these..."" Stormhold, Part 1[edit] The Conclave location Asking around about Murkwood leads you eventually to the Conclave of Baal in Stormhold, Black Marsh. Its leader, Idolan Lancaster, tells you that one of their junior members cast a spell that destroyed the Vaults of Gemin, where there also happened to be a tablet that would reveal the location of Murkwood. When you agree to fetch the tablet, you get the location of the Vaults of Gemin on your map. Vaults of Gemin[edit] The Vaults of Gemin is a large, two-level dungeon located just southwest of Stormhold. You will find the usual assortment of monsters (hell hounds, homonculi, wraiths, and zombies on the first floor and homonculus, zombies, wraiths, and stone golems on the second floor). Bring lots of potions: heal true,  resist fire and resist shock-potions, Levitation potions for second floor (or you'll be assaulted by stone golems).  If you're a warrior you might have some use for Invisibility potions (they let you get close to most enemies without being noticed, so they can't damage you from a distance). Unfortunately, this dungeon is also quite empty, with very few treasures and few monsters who give loot. On the first level, the way down (42,62) is more or less in the center of the dungeon.  There are about eighty little rooms, though, and while it's not exactly a maze, the rooms don't have any obvious logic to how they connect.  The fastest way down is to head east in the first east-west corridor, then take the first corridor south. Take the second door on the west, take two doors south and one door west, then loop back north around the west wall and go down. A tablet The second level is flooded and contains islands of dryness, with bridges between them and rooms on them. The tablet (52,90) is in a room in the south center behind a riddle door: Answer this, and pass - I come out of the earth, I am sold in the market. He who buys me cuts off my tail, Takes off my suit of silk, And weeps beside me when I am dead... ""Onion"" or ""An Onion"" is the right answer to unlock the door, as usual, nothing will happen otherwise and you won't receive a punishment for answering incorrectly. Beware of stone golems on the small islands and various distance fighters. When you take the tablet, a message appears: You have found the Tablet Idolan Lancaster sent you to recover. Once it is in his hands, he can direct you toward Murkwood... Stormhold, Part 2[edit] Return to the Conclave of Baal with the tablet so you can get the location of Murkwood on your map. Murkwood[edit] ""The mists of Murkwood, the Black Forest, swirl about. Inside the dark forest can be heard faint cries of despair, souls who have lost their way within its cunning web. Though the smell of decay flows from every tree and stone, within this forest lies the seventh piece of the Staff of Chaos..."" Like the Elden Grove, Murkwood is a hazy place with impenetrable hedgerows. There are some large open spaces, but not as many as in the Grove. This is the quickest dungeon to complete, though the monsters are harder to defeat. As you travel around this area, you will likely constantly receive text on your screen: The mists of Murkwood curl up around you, blinding you from danger and confusing your sense of direction... - You can hear what sounds like heavy breathing through  the mists, but the direction from which it came is  impossible to determine... - From out of the mists comes the sound of drums... - The hairs on the back of your neck rise as figures materialize out of the mists... The monsters you can expect to meet on the surface include undead, homonculi, and a few wolves, plus fire daemons and medusae near the entrance to the second floor. The biggest problem are the medusae, because they come in couples and often apply the tactic where one beats you while the other paralyzes you. If you're a warrior, you want to try to hit them both. Be sure to bring some Potions of Free Action to cure the paralysis. As is typical of a harder dungeon, there is basically no treasure here. The way down from the ground level is almost in the exact center of the map. However, it is inside a maze of vegetation that has awful monsters hiding around seemingly every corner. Your best bet to threading the maze is to refer to your map frequently to see if you are near the blue dot that signifies the way down. Also, some of the walls in the center maze are earthen, and it can be of some help to destroy them. Wind your way to the center and go down. The fire daemons are at the southwestern entrance to the maze in the center and the medusae are in the northern part of the maze. If you want to avoid the medusae, you can use Passwall on the earth walls to access the entrance from the south, but avoiding them is not guaranteed. You'll be faced with a riddle at the gate: To pass this portal, answer my riddle: - I tie and hold, capture and bind, yet both knights and knaves doth crave me. I faithfully enslave all within my grasp, whether or not they seek me. Yet those who have never felt my unmerciful hand, are pitied by their fellow Man... There's a single right answer: ""love."" A correct answer congratulates you and urges you to enter the second level: Thou hast found the answer.  Proceed into the heart of Murkwood... An incorrect answer will instead result in some chastisement but nothing more: Answer again mortal, for thou wert too hasty... The second level is the smallest dungeon in terms of exploration area. As you enter, you will be warned: You can see what looks to be a piece of the Staff directly ahead. From around you come strange screeching sounds, like iron being twisted and bent, again and again... The Staff piece is down here behind a riddle door, as always. Several iron golems are trapped in nearby cages that will open if you answer incorrectly, though if you are feeling confident you may want to deliberately get the riddle wrong in order to farm the iron golems for experience points. The riddle is: A simple riddle for some, a trap of eternity for others, - I run smoother than any rhyme, I love to fall but cannot climb. I tremble at each breath of air, And yet can heaviest burdens bear... - What is thy answer? The correct answer is ""water"" or ""the water"". If your answer is right, the golems remain caged and a message appears: Truly thou art worthy of the prize. Proceed mortal, and leave in peace... If your answer is wrong, the golems are released and a different message appears: Thou art wrong, mortal. Fight thy opponents. If victorious, thou may try again... Answer correctly to receive the Staff piece (61,80). The seventh piece attaches itself to the rest of the Staff, infusing it with a fiery glow that only dims slightly in time... Ambush[edit] Jagar Tharn will send you yet another vision and a minion. This time he is so confident that he just outright tells you where the last staff piece is: ""You amaze me with your tenacity. This game however, is at an end. As you may already know, the final piece of the Staff is in Dagoth-Ur, in the province of Morrowind. The information is useless to you, for none know the entrance to the volcano, and even if you survive the creatures I have sent against you now, you will not survive its depths. I bid you farewell, (PC name). You have been a most worthy opponent..."""

The_Streetkid,Prologue,"V starts out by fixing their broken nose at the El Coyote Cojo bar located in The Glen. Pepe, the bartender, tells V that he took out a loan from Kirk Sawyer, a new small-time Fixer in town, and Kirk is threatening to break his legs if he doesn't pay soon. Pepe requests that V either talks to Kirk into either forgetting about the debt or finding another way to settle it.
V approaches Kirk and, while he refuses to forgive Pepe's debt, a deal is settled. Kirk tasks V with stealing a Rayfield Aerondight owned by a corporate from Arasaka; If V is able to steal the car, then Kirk will forget about the debt Pepe owes him, and Kirk will even pay V some extra eddies for the job. After agreeing to the deal, V drives to Westbrook where the car is located, hitching a ride with Padre, a friend and local Fixer. Despite a brief confrontation with 6th Street gangoon Sam Carter, Padre delivers V to their destination and hands V his card.
Using the service key given to V by Kirk, V unlocks the car and turns it on, bypassing the alarm systems on the car that prevents the Night City Police Department from being alerted. Things seem to be going smoothly until someone suddenly opens the door from the outside, and V finds themselves staring down the barrel of a gun wielded by Jackie Welles, who intends to take the car for himself. V is then interrupted by the sudden arrival of the NCPD and Inspector Stints, who capture both of V and Jackie and has his officers pin them to the ground. Stints criticizes the two of them on their life choices and how little has changed, but before he can take them into custody, an Arasaka corporate, Kaoru Fujioka, who owns the car, comes to see the commotion. He uses his corporate reputation to order Stints to break V's legs and dump both V and Jackie in the river to drown. The officers knocks them unconscious, but instead of following what the Araskaka corporate said, Stints instead decides to just leave both V and Jackie in a alley since he dislikes corpos as much as everyone else.
V wakes up in the alley. V and Jackie talk as V takes a moment to recover. After getting to know V and the reason why they were stealing the Aerondight he had his eyes on, Jackie says that Kirk isn't as powerful as he seems to be, and his threats against Pepe are hollow at best. Jackie then invites V to breakfast, ending the questline leading into an introduction montage of Night City.","Find Kirk on the second floor.

The_Nomad,Prologue,"V starts in a mechanic's garage in the small town of Yucca, just southwest of the SoCal Border Crossing to Night City. While looking into a mirror, V removes the patch of their old nomad clan. While V is removing the patch, a mechanic is trying to repair their car, but needs a part that he doesn't have in stock. V turns to face the mechanic, and moves the mechanic out of the way. They make a short-term workaround that should last long enough to reach Night City. V leaves the garage, but before they can continue, V is hassled by the local sheriff, who asks pointed questions about their presence in his town and makes it clear that nomads, with or without a clan, are unwelcome.
V needs to meet up with their contact, Jackie Welles, to pick up the package they will both be smuggling into Night City. V slips past the patrolling sheriff, and heads south, towards the radio tower. At the radio tower, V climbs the radio tower and contacts Willie McCoy to receive Jackie's location, which turns out to be an abandoned farm close to the border. V drives to the abandoned farm. After making introductions, Jackie retrieves the package and places it in the trunk of V's car, and they both head out towards the border crossing.
At the Border Crossing, V and Jackie are stopped by the border guards and ordered to report for an inspection. V tells Jackie to stay with the car, and they enter the Border Crossing building. V steps into the room with the papers declaring their cargo to be ""lost on arrival"" - along with a sufficient bribe to ""encourage"" the guards not to look too closely. The guard accepts the bribe, but V gets a bad feeling that the guard knows more than he is letting on. V returns to their car, where they have Jackie take the wheel and get out of there as soon as possible; as they think something is definitely going on and V doesn't want to stick around. As they leave the crossing, V and Jackie are cut off by Arasaka security, who demands that they halt and hand over the corporate property that they are smuggling, revealing that they were set up. V tells Jackie to gun it, and lead the security team on a chase through the Biotechnica Protein Farm on the city's outskirts, eventually shaking them successfully and hiding in a nearby garage, where V's car finally breaks down for good. Inside the garage, V opens up the package to see what caused all the trouble: a genuine, live iguana. After discussing what to do next, Jackie, deciding he likes V, offers his hand and friendship and partnership as the iguana looks on, leading into the Night City introduction montage.","Talk to the mechanic.

The_Corpo-Rat,Prologue,"V starts out looking into the mirror while stress-vomiting in the sink of a bathroom located in the Arasaka Tower. After briefly speaking with their longtime friend Jackie Welles over the holo, V is called by their superior, Arthur Jenkins, who is upset because of a major data leak in Frankfurt that has put the corporation's operations at risk, and he orders them to his office, though V is able to freely walk into their own office and read emails located on the desk before reporting to Jenkins.
V finds Jenkins ordering a cyberattack against the European Space Agency council to delay their vote on revoking Arasaka's lunar base licenses. Jenkins is called by an angered Susan Abernathy—his superior and rival in the Arasaka Special Operations branch—who berates him for the attack and threatens to discipline him later. Already chafing under Abernathy due to her having smeared his name in Osaka to steal a promotion from him, Jenkins orders V to take her out, giving them a datashard containing all of Abernathy's personal information and a large sum of eurodollars.
Arthur tells V to use their underworld contacts to off her once and for all and provides them with paper eddies to pay for the work. Afterwards, V gets into an Arasaka AV that takes them to Lizzie's Bar in Watson. Landing on the roof, V is confronted by basketball players upset about the court being a landing pad for a corporate AV; V may either subdue them with a lightning attack, or simply threaten them into submission, before approaching the Mox door guard, who lets V in.
Inside the bar V meets up with Jackie, explaining the situation to him and requesting his help, but Jackie, seeing the extreme risk involved in working for Arasaka, refuses. However, before V can convince him otherwise or get an alternate plan started, the pair is interrupted by Arasaka agents. They reveal that Abernathy is already aware of the hit ordered against her and demands them to hand over the datashard given to V by Jenkins. V initially refuses, so they strip V of their corporate privileges and disables their cyberware, forcing them to hand over the shard and finalizing V's termination from the corporation. The Arasaka agents then attempt to take V into custody as well, as a ""favor"" to Abernathy, but Jackie intercepts them, pointing out that they are isolated from the rest of their compatriots and that a firefight in unfamiliar territory could end badly for them, which convinces the agents to leave V alone. The mission ends with V, still woozy from their disabled cybernetics, losing their balance and falling to the floor, to which Jackie helps them back on their feet, setting off to start their journey together.","Leave the bathroom.

After a brief conversation with Jackie Welles at Misty's Esoterica, he tells V that he's arranged a meeting for them with a local fixer, Dexter DeShawn, about a job. V heads to Dex's limo, which is a short walk from Misty's. During the meeting, which takes place in the limo, V is told about a job to steal an experimental biochip from Arasaka.
Dex mentions that the Maelstrom gang ambushed a Militech convoy and stole the experimental Flathead drone, which will be needed for the job, and that Meredith Stout, a Militech corporate agent, could help V obtain it from the gang. He also suggests paying a visit to the client for the job, Evelyn Parker.
After Dex drops V off at Kabuki Roundabout, V calls Jackie to bring him up to speed about what went down during the meeting, and asks if V plans to visit Maelstrom or Evelyn first.","Talk to Jackie.

The_Rescue,Act_1,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Rewrite from V's perspective]
The quest starts out with a montage of your exploits with Jackie in Night City. Six months later, V find themselves in their car alongside Jackie, discussing the job they're hired to complete by Wakako Okada.
V learns that the missing woman is probably in a den of Scavengers in room 1237 of a certain apartment block. T-Bug helps unlocking the main door and disabling the security system.
Upon getting inside, you and Jackie will head through two rooms, the second of which has the corpse of a woman packed with Zetatech repros on a table. The third room will contain your first enemy, which you will need to sneak up to and either kill or knock out before throwing his body in the container in front of him. Sneak up to the area next to the main room with Jackie, where you will need to wait for two more scavs to head through. Sneak up on one of them and then kill or incapacitate him.
There are five scavs to deal with in the main room, which you can take out however you like. You will also need to deal with the Scav Leader, who is packing some serious heat in the form of a Militech Mk. 31 HMG, which can and will kill you in seconds if you're open to him. Either take cover and blast him with whatever weapons you got off the scavs until he's dead, take the route that T-Bug gives you and provide cover fire so that Jackie can tackle and incapacitate him, or use a quickhack to distract him using the light in his chamber before sneaking up and dealing with him however you wish.
Once you've gotten past the scavengers, you and Jackie enter a bathroom on the other side of the apartment. In a bathtub you will find the missing woman, whose name is Sandra Dorsett, packed in ice with a dead man. While alive, she is medically unstable and requires you to save her using an AirHypo when she starts flatlining. After removing the GPS jammer which prevented Sandra's Trauma Team Platinum alert from activating, carry Sandra to the balcony where Trauma Team will arrive via an Atlus AV, order you to place Sandra on the stretcher they lay down and then extract her. You and Jackie must then leave using another elevator. Contact Wakako and tell her the job is done. It doesn't matter which of the options you pick.
On the drive back to V's home at Megabuilding H10 in Watson, you and Jackie will be ambushed by a van full of more scavengers. There are four scavs to deal with, two of whom open fire from the rear doors, another of whom fires on you upon opening a side door later on during the attack, and the driver. Deal with them quickly by shooting them with your pistol so you don't take too much damage, though if you don't take out all four scavs, the van will eventually crash and kill them all regardless.
You will then arrive at a NCPD blockade at the border of Watson, though Jackie will be able to convince an officer to let you pass, and then drive until you see a situation involving some gangoons running foul of a MaxTac squad and getting slaughtered. Finally, Jackie will drop you off before leaving to see his girlfriend. Head up to your apartment, where you will have the option to check your stash. Lying down on the bed will end the quest.","Follow Jackie.

The_Pickup,Act_1,"After meeting with Dexter DeShawn, V is instructed to obtain the Flathead−a prototype Militech combat bot−from the Maelstromer's led by Royce at the All Foods Factory in Northside, Watson. V was also given the number of a Militech internal affairs agent named Meredith Stout, who they can reach out to for more information regarding the Militech gear that was stolen from the convoy.[1]
Militech Meeting [Optional][]
If V calls the Militech agent [Optional]:

V reaches out to Meredith Stout. V knows about the bind Meredith is in and proposes to meet. The parties meet eachother at a storm channel under the overpass near the All Foods Factory in Northside. While approaching Meredith, V is overwhelmed by one of her bodyguards, who jacks into V's personal link to start an aggressive but brief interrogation. Stout asks V if they are alone and if they know if Anthony Gilchrist is the one who leaked information about the Militech convoy. The bodyguard disengages the link and lets V go, who proposes to make a deal with Meredith, information in exchange for the Militech Flathead. Meredith agrees to V's proposition, under the condition that V pays for the Flathead with a Militech Credchip.
V accepts Meredith's offer:
V receives a Militech Credchip infected with a daemon from Meredith Stout in order to pay for the Flathead.
If V uses Breach Protocol on the Militech Credchip successfully:
To remove the daemon

V uses Breach Protocol to breach the Militech Credchip, and was able to remove the daemon infecting the shard. This results in 10,000 eurodollars from the shard at a later point.
To make a copy
V uses Breach Protocol to breach the Militech Credchip, and was able to make a copy of the infected shard. This causes them to obtain a Synapse Burnout quickhack.
To remove the daemon and make a copy
V uses Breach Protocol to breach the Militech Credchip, and was able to remove the daemon infecting the shard, allowing them to retrieve 10,000 from the shard at a later point. In the process, they also made a copy of shard which causes them to obtain a Synapse Burnout, and allowing them to retrieve 10,000 eurodollars from the shard at a later point.
V declines Meredith's offer:
After declining Meredith's offer to pay for the Flathead using a Militech Credchip, V has to come up with an alternative to pay for the combat bot.

All Foods[]
Arriving at the All Food Factory, V meets up with Jackie Welles, and together they approach the main entrance gate of the factory. Using the intercom, they speak with Dum Dum−a high-ranking Maelstrom member−and are let inside after telling him that they are there for the Flathead. Making their way to the meeting point inside the factory, Jackie and V evade various deactivated traps. 
Entering the meat processing area of the factory, the duo takes an elevator up to the room where they meet face-to-face with Dum Dum.


This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Rewrite from V's perspective as a story walkthrough using {{Condition}} as per our Manual of Style, removal of bullet points]
Path 1 - Instant Death[]
This occurs if all of the following conditions are met:

V does not point a weapon at nor attack any of the Maelstrom gang members after entering their hideout
When Jackie refuses to sit down, V intervenes and asks him to do so
V takes too long to reply to Royce when he asks how they are going to pay
Royce simply shoots V in the head, necessitating a prior save.

Path 2 - A Peaceful Transaction[]
This occurs if all of the following conditions are met:

V does not take the chip from Meredith Stout
V does not point a weapon at nor attack any of the Maelstrom gang members after entering their hideout
When Jackie refuses to sit down, V intervenes and asks him to do so
V pays Royce with €$ 10,000 of their own cash
V obtains the Flathead, and is led peacefully from the premises by Dum Dum, who will then also give them his Black Lace inhaler if they have the Streetkid lifepath (even if they have rejected to take a whirl earlier). Provided Meredith Stout is not called, this is one possible way to unlock access to the Maelstrom Weapon Vendor, who will appear after completing the job. This is also a guaranteed way to keep Dum Dum alive, which in turn enables V to kill or incapacitate him during a later mission in which he carries his iconic gun that can then be looted.

Path 3 - Siding with Militech[]
This occurs if all of the following conditions are met:

V does take the chip from Meredith Stout
V does not point a weapon at nor attack any of the Maelstrom gang members after entering their hideout
When Jackie refuses to sit down, V intervenes and asks him to do so
V pays Royce either with a) the chip including its malware but giving Royce a heads-up warning (Corpo lifepath only), b) with the chip after removing its malware, or c) with €$ 10,000 of their own cash
After the transaction, Militech operatives will storm the All Foods Factory and start attacking the Maelstrom gang members. This is one of two options that allows to find and free former Maelstrom leader Brick (see below). If Brick is not freed and Dum Dum survives the mission, he can be encountered during a later mission in which he carries his iconic gun that can then be looted. After helping Maelstrom fighting off the Militech ambush and escaping the plant, Anthony Gilchrist will appear at the end of the mission, acknowledging that they are now even for saving one another's lives. This will result in Gilchrist eventually having Meredith Stout killed. Having the Nomad lifepath, V can also expose him as the mole by finding his message to Maelstrom on a computer in a sideroom of the first larger hall they enter after leaving the initial negotiation room in the All Foods Plant (only as a Nomad V can comprehend the full meaning of the message). Confronting Gilchrist with this at the end of the mission will cause him to promise an incentive to keep the information confidential. This will be a crate containing Militech equipment left at V's Apartment in Act 2.

Path 4 - Fight Maelstrom[]
This occurs if any of the following conditions were met:

V either pointed a weapon at or attacked any of the Maelstrom gang members after entering their hideout (Royce will appear as strong boss fight at the end; killing him rewards €$ 3,000).
V turns off or otherwise does anything to affect the cameras or turrets within the hideout (Royce will appear as strong boss fight at the end; killing him rewards €$ 3,000).
When Jackie refused to sit down, V did not ask him to do so (Royce will appear as strong boss fight at the end; killing him rewards €$ 3,000).
V paid Royce with the chip without removing its malware or warning him (Royce will appear as weakened boss fight at the end; killing him rewards €$ 3,000).
V killed Royce during the conversation (yields no extra money, but they will not have to fight him later).
This is the only way to obtain Chaos from Royce (either in the negotiation room or after the boss fight). This is also one of two options that allows V to find and free former Maelstrom leader Brick (see below).

Meeting the Militech operative after fighting Maelstrom[]
After successfully escaping the All Foods Plant, V met a Militech operative at the gates of the plant.
The Militech operative is Meredith Stout if these conditions were met:

V met with Meredith, survived the meeting by answering her questions, which allowed him to proceed to retrieve the Flathead from Maelstrom.
V struck a deal with her and accepted the cred chip.
V did not try to double-cross Meredith by removing the malware from the chip. It does not matter if V copied the malware on the chip as long as the malware is still on the chip.
Meredith reacted impressed and suggested working together again in the future. This is the only way to unlock Venus in Furs, which is initiated in Act 2 when Meredith contacts V again. This will also result in Stout eventually having Anthony Gilchrist killed. Having the Nomad lifepath, V can also expose him as the mole by finding his message to Maelstrom on a computer in a side room of the first larger hall they enter after leaving the initial negotiation room in the All Foods Plant (only as a Nomad V can comprehend the full meaning of the message). They will then be able to explain to Meredith how Militech's convoys in the border area get compromised and how to better protect them, which will cause her to be extra impressed and leave a crate containing Militech equipment as an additional reward at V's Apartment in Act 2.
If V fought Maelstrom but did not meet all the conditions for Meredith to appear at the gate, V is met by Anthony Gilchrist instead, which precludes Venus in Furs.

Saving Brick[]
Paths #3 and #4 allow V to find and free Brick. In order to save him, a laptop on a table in the room to the right of his cell needs to be opened and searched. On it V finds a message ""only you guys know"", which contains the code to Brick's cell door ""9691"". Then, either the detonator device on the table next to his cell door needs to be deactivated (requires Technical Ability skill 11) or V needs to disarm the mine inside the cell themselves. Although he is of no immediate use, Brick will later retake control of Maelstrom (only if Royce is killed during The Pickup), which will allow V to complete Second Conflict in Act 2 without having to fight. Deciding to activate the detonator and killing Brick will instead immediately yield €$ 5,000.

Journal Entry[]
Know what I like about your run-of-the-mill gangoons? They know what they like. Cash, sex, power... maybe just the sight of their enemies' blood. Real rays of sunshine, they are. But these Maelstrom cabrones... shit, never can be sure. They look at you with those creepy-ass toaster faces and you can't get a read of 'em, got no clue what twisted thoughts are racin' through their processors. You ask me, that's why biz with Maelstrom never turns out pleasant. But... sometimes there's just no gettin' around it. Let's grab that spiderbot, yeah? Make Dex proud.
If V met with Meredith Stout:
A Militech corpo-c*** lost an arms shipment, and if she doesn't find it, she'll be paddling up shit-creek with stumps for hands. I'm betting it's not even about the weapons - Militech could lose a tank and it'd make no difference to them. It's about principles. One thing's for damn sure - someone's taking the fall for this.
If V fought alongside Maelstrom:
Every corp has a Gilchrist. First he steals from them, turns a fat profit on the goods, lies about it, narrowly avoids the chopping block, gets rid of all witnesses, makes someone else take the fall from him, and to top it all off - he gets a promotion. Can't help feeling sorry for the Maelstrom gonks in this scenario... but only a little.
If V fought alongside Militech:
Turns out Meredith Stout will do anything to stay in the corp's good graces. Unfortunately that means her ""colleague"" might get demoted... or worse. All in all, Militech recovered their property, putting the Maelstrom freaks in a shittier mood than usual. A day like any other in Night City.

Notes[]
The job was originally named ""Going Pro"" before the game's release, and was split in several sub-objectives: ""The All Food deal"", ""Get the bot from the gang"", ""Escape from the factory"", ""Close the deal with Dex"", and the optional ""Corporate involvement""
The Militech Datashard must be decrypted from the Shards menu in order to receive the 10,000 eurodollars, which can be obtained by interacting with the Hacked Militech Datashard in the Backpack.
Doors will periodically lock behind you as you progress through the All Foods Factory. Once the job is completed, the factory becomes inaccessible.
While all Lifepaths can find the server room and read the messages about Maelstrom's ambush on the Militech convoy, only a Nomad V is able to bring it up during the conversation at the end of the job.
When siding with Militech and neutralizing the Maelstrom presence in the factory, Maelstrom members will periodically ambush V when they are getting into a vehicle in the Watson district. This feature was added in Patch 2.1.

After V spoke with Dexter DeShawn, they were sent to Lizzie's Bar on the corner of Kennedy Avenue and Sutter Street to get in touch with the client, Evelyn Parker.
Once inside the bar—between 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM—V approaches the bar and asks the bartender, Mateo Thiago, about Evelyn's whereabouts. As V approaches the bar, Evelyn is sitting on a barstool with Judy leaning next to her, but V doesn't know who they are yet. Mateo refuses to provide any information, and Judy leaves offscreen during that conversation. Evelyn, who was awaiting V's arrival, interrupts their conversation, and introduces herself to V as Mateo pours a drink for them. Evelyn will proceed to ask V to follow her to a more secluded VIP room.
In the VIP room, Evelyn briefly interrogates V about their relationship with Dexter DeShawn, after which she explains her unique gig and its attached strings. Evelyn tells V that the Arasaka biochip called the Relic is in a secure location inside Konpeki Plaza in penthouse. The penthouse is occupied by Saburo Arasaka's son and heir Yorinobu Arasaka, who recently arrived in Night City. Evelyn proceeds to explain that Yorinobu stole the biochip from an Arasaka laboratory, and intends to make a deal with NetWatch in order to sell it. Evelyn reveals that she has scrolled a braindance of Yorinobu's penthouse while she was there as Yorinobu's personal joytoy, as V and Evelyn move further inside Lizzie's Bar towards the workshop. While heading down to the basement, Evelyn tells V about Judy Álvarez and warns V to behave themselves.
Once in Judy's workshop, Evelyn introduces V to Judy, who was just finishing up compiling the Konpeki Plaza braindance. If V has high enough Technical Ability, they can have a short side conversation about Judy's tech setup before Evelyn interrupts. Judy instructs V to sit down in the chair nearby, after which she places the Braindance Wreath on V. Judy returns to her desk to calibrate V's sensory profile and then prepares V for the calibration braindance.
During the calibration braindance, V re-experiences the last minutes of a low-life Scavenger that robbed a Cali Express. The Scavenger was shot and killed by his compatriot, upon which the braindance ends and calibration finishes.
Having exited the calibration braindance, V needs a moment to catch their breath and is unsure if they want to continue. Evelyn reminds them of the importance of the next braindance and that it's crucial for the gig. Convinced by Evelyn's words, V tells Judy that they need to involve the Netrunner T-Bug as well, so that she can study the security of Konpeki Plaza.
Judy resists allowing T-Bug to link in, but Evelyn convinces her to allow it, reassuring Judy that she'd never let harm come to her. T-Bug and V navigate the braindance of Yorinobu's suite, where they identify high-tech security systems and a temperature-controlled vault that contains the Relic. T-Bug is sure that she can override the security systems, and she points out the gun that Yorinobu keeps in the suite, saying that V should keep it in mind.
After V exits the braindance, Judy scrubs V's profile from her system. She's worried that Evelyn and V will get killed, and that if Arasaka finds out about the braindance, they'll kill everyone involved. V and Evelyn reassure Judy, and then Judy tells V to keep the braindance wreath. Before leaving Judy's workshop, V can optionally have a brief conversation with Judy to thank her or express interest in seeing her again.
Before V leaves the basement, Evelyn wants to talk, and V can ask several probing questions about the job and Evelyn's relationship with Yorinobu. Evelyn then asks V to do the job just for her, without including Dex. V protests that hazing Dex will ruin them, but Evelyn dismisses the concern. V can refuse or say that they'll think about it. Evelyn says that she needs to talk Judy, and V is directed to leave Lizzie's.","Go to Lizzie's Bar between 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM.

Notes[]
The robbed shop featured in the calibration braindance is a Cali Express located in The Glen. It is the food vendor found between fast travel points Ventura & Skyline and Metro: Glen South. Speaking to the vendor will give V the option to comment on the smell of chlorine, to which the vendor will reply about having to clean up ""[a] few stains that wouldn't come out"", referencing the robbery and murder seen on the braindance.
Trivia[]
The Information is a 1998 song by Course of Empire, from the soundtrack of the film, Dark City.

The_Heist,Act_1,"After V retrieved the flathead from Maelstrom and the information from Evelyn Parker, V is now ready to start the job Dexter DeShawn hired V and Jackie for.
V heads out to The Afterlife to meet up with Jackie and talks to him for a bit before heading into the club. The bouncer will eventually let them in regardless of the option V chooses. As Dex is still busy, V can look around some but ultimately they'll need to go sit down at the bar with Jackie and can talk a bit more with him and the bartender, Claire, before Dex's bodyguard Oleg summons them.
Heist Briefing[]
Follow Jackie to the back room where Dex and T-Bug are waiting to go over the heist's details. V can converse with T-Bug before placing the flathead in the case. Once they do, sit and Dex will begin to ask V some questions, particularly about Evelyn, who V can reveal wanted to cut out the middleman or not. Regardless, Dex will eventually direct them to a shard on the table, take it as Dex and T-Bug continue to fill you in on the plan.
V can ask questions about the mission, then Jackie will bring up how the pay is being split. Dex notes V and Jackie get 30% but V can have him bump it up to 35% if they point out this is about more then eddies, and then that they want to be remembered for something, or, for Corporate Lifepath, that this is about revenge on Arasaka as well. Dex will bump it up to 40% if he is told about Evelyn Parker's desire to cut him out of the deal. After Dex heads off, V can then talk to T-Bug some more before she also heads out. Jackie will then ask if V is ready or not.
Note that once V gets in the cab, they won't be able to return to exploring Night City and finish other missions until Act 2, so if you need to wrap anything else up before then, do it now.
Infiltrating the Hotel[]
Once V is ready, they can put on the suit and get in the taxi. After some banter between Delamain and Jackie, it'll verify V's and Jackie's identity and then drive them to the hotel. On the way, V can talk to Jackie some about how he's acting regarding this job. Once they arrive, follow Jackie once he gets the flathead out and head in through the scanner and then check in. At one point during the convo with the receptionist, they will need to stall her. If V doesn't say anything T-Bug will pose as the receptionist and trick the hotel receptionist. Once the receptionist guides them to the lobby V can continue to the hotel's bar or continue to follow Jackie up the elevator (Jackie will refuse and heads upstairs if you look around).
Once upstairs and in the room, T-Bug will ask V to scan for the entry point for the flathead to use, which is right in the corner between the terrarium and the window. Jackie will command it initially but eventually V will be asked to control the flathead as it got stuck and Jackie's optics can not scan. The flathead fully navigates itself, they just need to tell it where to go, but some rooms V has to interact with objects via the Flathead to progress.
Eventually the flathead reaches the area outside the hotel's netrunner, where V will have to do a mix of scanning a particular object and then manually switch cams to see inside the netrunner's room to find a way for the flathead to get inside. Once it's in, T-Bug needs a few hours to get around their security so go sit and it'll fast forward to night.
When V wakes up, Jackie will be questioning why Yorinobu even tried to leave his family as he could want for nothing under the Arasaka name, but instead tried to start a gang. T-Bug will then note it's time, so head out to the elevator, which will give V and Jackie direct access to the penthouse. While they'll press to make it quick, they can still look around and loot stuff like Yorinobu's attire: Yorinobu's formal shirt, Yorinobu's slacks, and Kōtetsu no Ryū coat, and an Iguana Egg at the terrarium. Once ready, join Jackie and as T-Bug is uploading to it, they will see some unexpected guests arriving by AVs. To make things worse, as Jackie gets the case, T-Bug warns them that Yorinobu is heading too quickly to the penthouse so they will need to hide fast. Head behind the TV screen where she'll open the panel here, and get in.
If V doesn't enter the panel and instead waits for the elevator to arrive:
Adam Smasher will enter taking V down in one shot and then stomping their head as Jackie yells out to them. This event will instantly kill V.
A scene will play out with Yorinobu entering with Adam Smasher before they're unexpectedly joined by his father, Saburo Arasaka and his own bodyguard, Goro Takemura. After dismissing the two bodyguards, things go awry between the son and father and Yorinobu kills Saburo by strangling him to death before initiating a hotel lockdown, claiming someone poisoned his father.
Escaping[]
Taking the elevator is out, so T-Bug will direct V instead to the balcony to try and get to a ladder there. However, just as she gets the doors opened, she's killed on her end. When V gets to the corpse, Jackie will say that his AV should still be on the roof, suggesting to drive it to safety, go to the AV and defeat the two guards, there is some loot inside the AV but unfortunately AV will recognise that there are trespassers and lock itself down. The AV's AI will alert more security leaving them to run to the window T-bug opened. They head out and around and walk across the thin railing to the ladders, but halfway across hostile forces will spot V and Jackie and they will have no choice but to jump. After a short dialogue scene, Jackie will plug the Relic into himself to keep it safe while they both try to escape the hotel.
They will have to go through a number of areas with Arasaka guards. The first elevator they reach won't be accessible as an access token is required. As they reach the second elevator location, they will spot the officer who's carrying it here and they will need to take him out (lethal or non-lethal) to get the token. Once they have it, they access the elevator and can talk a bit before they reach the hotel's lobby area with more guards and if not done stealthily a mech.
Whichever way they manage to get back to the entrance, they take the elevator here to Delamain, which will be under fire, they can ignore the enemies and enter the cab. However, Arasaka sends out Adam Smasher to retrive them and pursue them with three drones, consisting of one Octant and two Griffins. V needs to shoot them down to progress.
After managing to escape, Jackie's injuries prove to be too severe and after he hands the Relic over to V, he dies. Delamain will subsequently ask where V would like to send his remains, and they can choose from several options:
If V chooses to send Jackie's body to his family or tells him to stay put:
This will unlock the sidejob Heroes.
If V chooses to send Jackie's body to Viktor Vektor:
It will later be revealed that Arasaka took the body from Viktor.
After making a decision, V exits the vehicle to go meet Dex inside the No-Tell Motel.
Dex is none too pleased with what happened, as the offing of the emperor is all over the news now. Even if V tells him that it wasn't them and Jackie that did it, Dex will tell them that Arasaka and their ninjas don't know or care about that. He'll eventually agree though that escaping Night City is the best option here before sending V off to go wash the blood off their face. Once they do and leave the bathroom though, his bodyguard knocks them down before Dex shoots them in the head.","Head to The Afterlife.

Following the events of The Heist, wherein V is killed by Dexter DeShawn, the former's brain is repaired by the biochip's nanites, and they begin to relive the memories contained on it, specifically those that occurred on August 20th, 2023.
Now in the perspective of Johnny Silverhand, the Rocker makes his way to The Hammer, where Kerry Eurodyne has already begun to perform due to the former being late. Johnny is accosted by the bouncer, who angrily pushes Silverhand aside. Johnny continues inside until he is on stage, where he states that he is saying goodbye to his fans.
Before Johnny makes his eventual exit, he is stopped by Kerry, who hopes to dissuade him from marching towards his eventual death. Johnny brushes this off and depending on player choice, tells Kerry to pursue his own career instead of living in Johnny's shadow, or insults him.
Outside, Johnny meets with Rogue Amendiares, and the two board a helicopter destined for Arasaka Towers along with Shaitan and Spider Murphy. Upon reaching Arasaka Tower's roof, Shaitan begins to open fire on soldiers before being shot. Johnny takes over and clears the rooftop of all hostiles, he quickly checks the payload, revealed to be a miniature nuclear device to be planted inside of the building.
Johnny, Rogue, and Spider fight their way through the tower until they reach an elevator, which Johnny to send the nuclear device inside further down. Rogue motions for them return to the rooftop to make their getaway, though Johnny protests, stating he had another objective in mind: uploading a virus into Arasaka's systems which would free Alt Cunningham. Rogue gives him four minutes to secure Alt and make for the helicopter.
Johnny makes his way to Kei Arasaka's office, fighting soldiers in the garden area, before eventually uploading the virus under the direction of Spider Murphy. After completion, Johnny attempts to leave before being ambushed by Adam Smasher and his team. From there, there is a gap in Johnny's memories during which he evidently escaped Smasher, meeting with Rogue on the rooftop. Johnny rushes to reach the already-ascending helicopter, briefly getting lifted by Rogue before they are hit by an explosion, causing Johnny to fall be left behind. Smasher appears and shoots a dying Johnny, causing his consciousness to fade. He briefly reawakens on a stretcher being carried off by Arasaka employees amidst the chaos. Johnny wakes again, this time to an interrogation by Arasaka agents. Johnny can either stay silent or toy with the interrogators.
The interrogation is joined Saburo Arasaka, who after a brief interrogation, orders Johnny to be subject to Soulkiller.","Go on stage.

Lightning_Breaks,Act_2,"Panam Palmer asks V to meet her again during midnight at the garage near the Sunset Motel in Rocky Ridge, to discuss their plan on how to take down the Kang Tao AV.
When V meets her there, she will be working on her truck. She quickly finishes up, and she and V will discuss a plan to use an EMP launched from a power station to take down the Kang Tao AV, and enter the AV to take Anders Hellman.
After they discuss the plan, V rides with Panam to the location where they plan to take down the AV. While on their way there, Panam stops the car, and lets V calibrate to the machine gun attached to her car, requiring V to jack in and shoot at a few abandoned vehicles with it. Afterwards, they discuss how they plan to launch the EMP using the power station.
V and Panam then wait a few hours for the AV to fly over before making their way to the power station. Upon arriving, V jacks into Panam's machine gun mounted to her car, and they are chased down by a few drones that V must shoot down. Once the drones are shot down, V jacks out of the gun, and Panam drives her car into the entrance of a control station. There, V overcharges the terminal, and rushes back to Panam's car, and they drive out of and away from the power station to a cliff looking over it, as to ensure the pulse from the EMP does not interfere with them.
Panam gives V the detonator for the EMP, and they wait a brief period of time before they spot the AV flying over coming from Pacifica. V triggers the detonator, which does not work immediately, and sends the EMP too late to take the AV out of the sky. Panam steps out of the truck, and uses an RPG to shoot down the AV herself. This does not take it down either, but does force it to lose altitude. This leads directly into Life During Wartime.","Meet Panam at midnight.

Automatic_Love,Act_2,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Should be written from V's perspective. See our Quest Guidelines]
After meeting with Takemura, you decide to track down Evelyn Parker to find out if she knows anything about the Relic. After optionally calling Judy, head to Lizzie's Bar, and enter her workshop. After a brief conversation with Judy, you discover that she doesn't know where Evelyn is, but she points you in the direction of a dollhouse called Clouds on the 12th floor of Megabuilding H8, where Evelyn used to work. Clouds opens at 5pm, if you came earlier then V will have the option to sit on a nearby bench and wait.
After arriving, you make an appointment to see a doll there, either Angel or Skye, as well as temporarily giving up your weapons while in the facility. Your appointment with Angel or Skye can be cut short by using your safeword, or followed through on an strange soul-search by the doll. Once you use your safeword, you question them for information about Evelyn's location, and they suggest you speak to another doll named Tom in the VIP area. At this point, you have the option to examine booth 11, where the incident that resulted in Evelyn's absence occurred. You can examine a missing port on the wall next to the bed and blood on the wall opposite it. Finally, you can play a recording which shows that the customer did not harm Evelyn, instead, she bugged out in what looks like a remote hack by a netrunner. Some dialogue lines with Johnny are available here.
Entering the VIP area without an access card will cause the Tyger Claws to become hostile towards you, but if you wait outside for a while, a gang member will enter the nearby bathroom where you can stealthily take him out and steal his access card. Alternatively, a shutter in the hallway leading between the main ring of booths and the VIP door leads to an exterior walkway, which can be followed around to a backroom. This same backroom can also be accessed from the bathroom area via a door with a Body 9 requirement to force open. Inside this backroom is a single Tyger Claw, who can be knocked out for an access card, along with an elevator to a backroom in the VIP area, permitting access even without an access card. Guards in the main room will spot you if you linger in front of the glass window too long, but will not comment or stop you if you walk out of the backroom into the VIP lounge.
Once in the VIP area, enter Tom's booth, and he will reveal that Evelyn had an accident there and ended up in a special clinic in Oslo. He suggests speaking to the dolls' caretaker, Woodman, whose office is in a restricted part of the building, so you'll have to disable at least the security camera by the door, and enter when the guards are not watching if you wish to avoid combat. Several side-rooms off the path to Woodman can be explored, including a dressing/prep room for the dolls. On the counter in the first cubby by the door is the iconic katana Cocktail Stick, as well as Evelyn's jacket, which is only a scanable prop that will evoke a comment from Johnny. More information about the accident can be found on the computer in the server room near Woodman's office and on a shard there. You can also find Evelyn's Schedule shard and Evelyn's Handbag in the locker room nearby.
Woodman will not immediately be hostile when you enter his office, but the dialogue you choose during the interrogation can cause him to become so. If you have enough Intelligence, you can offer information on how to better secure their system, or, if you chose the Corpo lifepath, on the real bosses of the Tyger Claws, in exchange for information about what happened to Evelyn. Alternatively, if Gig: Monster Hunt has been completed, Jotaro Shobo's fate can be mentioned and used to intimidate Woodman into giving information. Otherwise, to maintain a peaceful conclusion, you'll need to choose the following:
You don't understand what's at stake.
Let's not make this harder than it has to be.
One way or another, I'll find out...
If Woodman does become hostile, you will instead have to defeat him and learn the information he would've told you by reading a message on his computer. Either way, you will be directed to see a ripperdoc called Fingers on Jig-Jig Street.","Call Judy. [Optional]

Never_Fade_Away_(quest),Act_2,"While speaking with Brigitte in the Voodoo Boys' Rezo Agwe subnet, V is dragged into one of Johnny's memories.
After walking onstage and grabbing the microphone, they get sucked in deeper. Several scenes flash from the Samurai performance, with a final act of Johnny firing his Malorian sidearm. After the performance ends, V experiences the memory of Johnny for the remainder of the quest.
Kerry Eurodyne and Johnny exit the stage, all the while Kerry lashes out at Johnny for being reckless and crossing the line, stating that Samurai is not just Johnny's band and that it's not a solo act.
Johnny pushes Kerry aside while saying that he is the only one with a vision for the band's future, and tells Kerry to go fuck himself, while storming inside the dressing room, looking for drugs.
Inside the dressing room, Johnny's girlfriend, Alt Cunningham awaits him, and they engage in an intimate scene together. Afterwards, Alt tells Johnny that she is done with Samurai and what the band stands for and is leaving, but couldn't ghost Johnny without saying something. Johnny's anger is sparked once again, claiming that she and Kerry are both cowards, that they are afraid of Arasaka and that only he is the only one that can stand up to Arasaka.
While Alt dresses up, Johnny searches for his drugs once more. Though Alt leaves the building first, Johnny catches up to her and tries to make amends for his behaviour. While in the back alley, they are approached by several ominous-looking thugs. Johnny tells Alt to run and reaches for his Malorian. While managing to fire a few shots, Johnny is ultimately felled by one of the thugs equipped with Mantis Blades. The last thing Johnny sees of Alt is her being taken away by the thugs in a van.
Shortly after, while seemingly on his last legs, Johnny is saved by media Lyle Thompson. Lyle manages to bring Johnny to Milt Nauman, a ripperdoc and old friend of Johnny. Several hours pass as Nauman manages to put Johnny back in one piece. While Johnny gets back on his feet, he tells Lyle that he suspects that Arasaka are the ones behind the abduction, to which Lyle responds that this may be true as she was working on software for ITS that Arasaka wanted to acquire. They set out for the Atlantis to meet with Rogue, Johnny's ex-lover and a Solo, who may be able to help with rescuing Alt.
Arriving at the Atlantis, Thompson stays in the car to wait for Johhny's return. Once inside, Johnny heads onto the second floor and speaks with Engels at the door to gain access to Rogue.
Rogue is waiting with Santiago, a Nomad, for a possible client, but there seems to be no client coming as there are several emptied bottles. Johnny suggests that they both come with him to raid Arasaka Tower in order to save Alt. They both agree, but soon after they're attacked by Arasaka goons that have swarmed the Atlantis in force. They fight their way out and meet up with Lyle outside.
While making their escape in Johnny's Porsche, and after shaking off their pursuers, they plan their attack on Arasaka Tower by staging a diversion in front of it.
Once inside Arasaka Tower, they fight their way through the Arasaka soldiers to find the mainframe. The mainframe is guarded by Akira, a skilled Arasaka agent. After neutralizing Akira, head inside the room where Alt is being kept and attempt to save her. In his anger Johnny shoots Toshiro, Alt's handler, and disconnects her prematurely, severing the connection she has with her body. While mourning the loss of Alt, Johnny gets frustrated and lashes out at Lyle, who is still recording everything, and nearly beats him to death, only being halted by Rogue.
After Rogue confirms that Alt has deceased, V is sucked out of the memory and returns to Rezo Agwe.","Grab the microphone.

After escaping from Arasaka's clutches at the Redwood Market in Japantown, you are contacted by Goro Takemura. He has brought Hanako Arasaka to his safe house inside an Abandoned Apartment Building on Vine Street in Vista del Rey, Heywood, and tells you to knock four times on the door to safely get inside.
Once you arrive at the safe house, head to apartment 303 on the third floor and knock on the door four times, Takemura will open the and tell you to hurry up inside. Once inside, you talk with Takemura and sit down with Hanako, to whom you will explain the situation around her father's death.
Hanako will not answer to any word you say, and weird sounds are coming from the hallway. Takemura instructs you to check out what is happening. Shortly afterwards, Arasaka forces breach the safe house, leaving you to fight your way outside to safety once more.

After Arasaka forces breach the apartment building, it is possible to save Takemura from Arasaka's forces. You can fight your way back up to the third floor, or use the Fortified Ankles/Reinforced Tendons if you have them installed. You and Goro Takemura will then both fight your way outside. If he is not saved, he will not appear during The Devil ending if it is chosen during Nocturne Op55N1, and you won't be able to get The Devil achievement (even if you choose to side with Arasaka at the end).
After escaping the apartment building, you retreat to the Sunset Motel in Red Peaks, the Badlands and speak with Johnny Silverhand. A person arrives and knocks on your room. After letting them in, you find out it is a Proxy for Hanako. She wants to meet with you.","Get to the hideout.

Ghost_Town,Act_2,"Head to the Afterlife and look for Rogue Amendiares, Night City's top fixer and Johnny Silverhand's ex-lover. Asking her about Anders Hellman results in Rogue demanding money in exchange for her help. After paying her and waiting a day, Rogue provides V with an information Shard. V slots it in, learning that the Kang-Tao transport is carrying an anonymous person, presumed to be Hellman. In order to take down the AV and interrogate Hellman, V must first recruit a driver named Panam Palmer, a nomad merc who can help. Rogue states that V must help Panam get her car back in exchange.
After contacting Panam and meeting up with her at the Rancho Coronado Container Freight Station, V explains the situation, offering info on Panam's cargo in return. She demands to know the location of her car, which V reveals is in Rocky Ridge. Panam agrees on the condition that they get her car first. She also explains that her partner, Nash, stole her vehicle and their cargo and plans to sell it in Rocky Ridge.
Panam calls the client, Boz, and agrees to meet over the phone. Panam explains she used to drive for Boz, a 6th Street gang member she refers to as a ""good guy."" They must go to the Aldecaldo Camp to pick up her friends to help.
Upon arriving at the camp, V meets Scorpion and Mitch, two of Panam's friends. The two tell Panam that Saul, the camp's leader, has order them to watch the generators until they are brought online, barring them from helping. However, Mitch offers the duo to take any gear they might need instead.
Panam and V arrive at the ghost town of Rocky Ridge. Panam checks the substation while V scan's the power source and fusebox. Panam plans to use the substation to confuse the Raffen with the traffic lights. They wait for the Raffen to approach and commence with the plan. After the Raffen have been disposed of and they have recovered Panam's car, Panam states that they need to track down Nash. Here, V can choose to help Panam or not.
If V decides to help Panam:
Panam explains that she granted Nash her trust, and he betrayed her. Her and V go to the Raffen Shiv's hideout to hunt him down.
While driving, they discuss the plan to meet the 6th street gang at the Sunset Motel. They arrive at the motel and Panam hands off a package of merch to Boz. They head inside the hotel and order a drink from the bartender Noah. Panam reveals that the package contained Betahaloperidol, ""drugs for the cyberpsychos in our midst.""

V in cyberspace sees a red figure and follows it. V follows this flickering form a few times before they are eventually able to interact with him. They will wake up in a landfill and crawl out of it before Dexter DeShawn and Goro Takemura appear.
As V slips in and out of consciousness, Takemura ends up killing Dex and puts V in his vehicle to take them to Hanako Arasaka. However, when V comes back around, an injured Takemura needs their help and gives V an airhypo. V needs to take it and fight off Arasaka assassins who are attacking them.
If V fails to use the air hypo in time:
V failed to use the airhypo in time and succumbed to their injuries.
If V uses the air hypo in time:
Takemura will hand V a JKE-X2 Kenshin to dispatch the assassins, but then another with mantis blades will show up. After Takemura squashes the last assassin by crashing into a billboard, Takemura asks for a ripperdoc that V can trust so both of them can get the medical attention they require. After V names Viktor, they call Delamain, who picks the duo up. Takemura performs triage on V with Delamain's help, and narrowly manages to bring V to Viktor's Clinic in Little China, with Takemura almost succumbing to his own injuries upon arrival.
Several weeks pass with sporadic moments of consciousness—as Viktor tries to keep V alive—until one day V regains full consciousness, and is able to speak to Viktor.
Viktor explains that V's hallucinations are fragments of Johnny Silverhand's memories, triggered by Dex shooting them in the head. The Relic inside of their shard slot was consequently triggered, using nanites to revive their brain. However, these nanites also recognize V's mind as a foreign entity, which it is now destroying in an effort to clear the way for the Johnny's engram.
Misty enters the room and takes V back to their apartment and gives them medicine: Pseudoendotrizine that speeds up the process, and Omega blockers that slow the process down. V talks with her a bit before she leaves.
When V wakes up, Johnny will be rather hostile and when V tries to leave, he'll instead push them backwards. However, Johnny and V will realize that they are connected, with Johnny attempting to disconnect the Relic, nearly killing V. When V comes to and attempts to take the pills, Johnny slaps them out of their hand and instead demands that they ""stick an iron in your mouth and pull the trigger"", before leaving them to crawl to their pills. V swallows one and passes out.
V will wake up in the shower and then when leaving the apartment, Takemura will call asking to meet in Tom's Diner to talk. In the diner he talks about why he saved V and his future goals, including proving that Yorinobu killed his father using V as a witness. He also promises that Arasaka can help V with their biochip problem. V talks about alternative methods of possibly dealing with the biochip but Takemura disregards them and leaves the diner.
When Takemura leaves, Johnny Silverhand projects himself in front of V. He says he has changed his mind and doesn't want V dead anymore and that he and Rogue knew each other a long time ago and that she can help.","Approach the stranger.

Afterwards, you can visit Judy's editing room, and Judy will show you the two BDs extracted from Evelyn.
The First BD[]
In this BD, Evelyn is talking to the female Netrunner who hired Evelyn to record the BD of Yorinobu's penthouse. Unfortunately, the woman's face detail was strongly encrypted and neither V nor Judy are able to figure out who she is. V notices a symbol on the Holoview and concludes the contractor must be working with the Voodoo Boys. Additionally, V believes the location to be Pacifica according to the flyers on the ground near Evelyn, and the vévé markings around the altar.
The Second BD[]
In this BD, Evelyn is in an alley, while the Netrunner speaks to someone on the phone while remaining concealed at the bottom of a staircase. According to the dialogue between the woman and the other Netrunner, V and Judy find out that they need to meet Alt Cunningham in cyberspace via Johnny Silverhand's engram.

This is a hideout of the Voodoo Boys and the physical location of their Data Fortress, Rezo Agwe. Brigitte exploits V and Johnny Silverhand to communicate with Alt Cunningham, who can help the Voodoo Boys' members go through the Blackwall.
In cyberspace, V experiences one of Johnny's inaccurate memories. In the memory, the player will control Johnny in the year 2013.
Never Fade Away[]
Main article: Never Fade Away (quest)
In 2013, Alt Cunningham was abducted by goons hired by Arasaka. Johnny tried to defeat the goons but got ambushed by one of the goons using Mantis Blades. Johnny was later saved and taken to a Ripperdoc called Milt Nauman by Lyle Thompson, a Media who initially planned to meet Alt at the same time.
Later, Johnny hired Rogue and Santiago to break into Arasaka Tower and save Alt together. Rogue was initially unwilling to get involved. However, in the middle of the meeting between Johnny and the two, Arasaka agents broke in the location. They succesfully escaped from the agents. After defeating the agents, Johnny finally got into his car, with Lyle driving. Rogue and Santiago took motorcycles. They went to a safe place and planned the strike. Johnny organized his fans to make a rebellion against Arasaka, and decided to call Nancy to report the rebellion, in order to distract Arasaka. Then Johnny, Rogue, Santiago, and Lyle struck into Arasaka Tower and approached the mainframe. They finally found Alt, who had been jacked in Soulkiller. Johnny unceremoniously killed Toshiro next to Alt, and subsequently unplugged Alt from the mainframe, denying her to return to her body. Much to Johnny's madness, he punched Lyle since Lyle was still recording for the news. Then Johnny had to admit that Alt was dead.
The Blackwall[]
After the playback, V is returned to cyberspace. V talks to Johnny about the memory, and then flashes back to Brigitte in cyberspace. Brigitte takes V and her Netrunners next to the Blackwall, and sends V to go through the Blackwall and talks to Alt Cunningham for taking the Voodoo Boys' members through the Blackwall.
If V has chosen to cooperate with Bryce Mosley in I Walk the Line:
Because the shard given by the agent has removed Placide's malware in V but installed NetWatch's own tracker. Once the VDB's contact Alt, she realizes NetWatch is taking action and to stop them she flatlines the Voodoo Boys except for V.
After V exits cyberspace, with Brigitte and her Netrunners' bodies lying on the chairs, the rest of the Voodoo Boys' members led by Placide are on alert. V must defeat Placide and the remaining Voodoo Boys' members to escape the church.
If V has followed Placide's plan in I Walk the Line:
With Alt's aid, the Voodoo Boy's Netrunners successfully go through the Blackwall.

After taking out the Satwave Power Plant, Panam Palmer and V chase after the crashing Kang Tao AV deep into the Jackson Plains of the southern Badlands. While chasing the AV, communications on the radio frequency have Mitch and Scorpion approach the AV first. Panam attempts to warn Mitch and Scorpion, but the EMP interferes, and she is unable to do so.
Panam and V are attacked by three Kang Tao Griffin drones which have to be taken down. V does so by jacking into Panam's truck and taking control of its machine gun. However, while V takes down the drones, the gun malfunctions, forcing Panam to put the truck on autodrive and fix the machine gun. She does so after several seconds, but a bullet ricochets into her back. Regardless, she goes back to driving, and V takes down the drones.
Panam and V arrive at the site of the AV crash. Panam takes an expired injector to deal with her wound. V agrees to go to the AV, while Panam stays to cover V with Mitch's gun.
If V abandons Panam and heads straight for the gas station (does NOT unlock I'll Fly Away):
V leaves Panam and single-handedly retrieves Hellman from a nearby gas station that he and his bodyguards sought refuge in. Panam then shows up with Aldecaldos reinforcements, saying that she managed to rescue Mitch herself and that unlike V, she does not bail. Her subsequent text messages will be very frustrated about her life outside the clan and include a remark about Mitch, who gave Scorpion an Aldecaldos-style funeral by himself.
If V assists Panam in clearing the wreckage (unlocks I'll Fly Away):
Nearing the AV's crash site, Panam instructs V to use a surveillance drone to identify any remaining Aldecaldo survivors and scan for enemies in the area, and the AV. After scanning the AV and Mitch, V can exit the drone. Panam provides overwatch while V takes out the hostile forces. As a last stand, the remaining Kang Tao operative takes Mitch captive and locks them both inside the AV. When opened by V, the operative can be intimidated (dialogue options ""only looking for Hellman"" and ""I'm losing my patience""), causing him to reveal Hellman's whereabouts. This allows Panam and V to immediately head for the gas station to the west that Hellman and his guards took refuge in.
Alternatively, V or Panam (if one waits too long) can shoot the soldier holding Mitch, the latter will tell the pair that Scorpion died during the assault, and that Kang Tao escaped using Aldecaldo vehicles. The group then has to follow the tire tracks around the wreckage to pursue find Hellman. Scanning the tire tracks allows V to see a simulation of where Kang Tao went. However, this delay will result in additional Kang Tao reinforcements present at the gas station.
V and Panam will subsequently head to the gas station via motorcycle. In the end, Aldecaldos reinforcements will arrive and Panam and V part ways after a short talk.
Regardless, once in the gas station, V searches for Hellman.
If V finds the gas station owner:
V finds the gas station owner locked in a room behind the counter. He tells V that he is unarmed, and can tell V that Hellman is on the second floor.
V finds Hellman being attended to by a Kang Tao medic. Hellman panics about Arasaka being sent after him, but V knocks him out.[N 1] They call Goro Takemura, telling him to meet them at the Sunset Motel. They then carry Hellman outside, where they meet with the Aldecaldos. After V and Panam talk, she allows V to take Scorpion's Apollo, and V takes Hellman to the motel.
V wakes Hellman up once there in a motel room. V tries to get Hellman to help them with their biochip, doing so by explaining the biochip, how they have it, and what they've tried to do about it so far. He tells V that the biochip was experimental, and that the biochip was in its trial phase. After some conversation about the biochip, Hellman jacks into V to examine the biochip. He then tells V that they cannot function independently of the biochip, as their neural network has deteriorated too much for that to be possible. He also says that all he can do is to send V to a clinic in Sweden, and help V minimize their pain. He can then ask V about how they deal Johnny Silverhand's engram, although V can choose to not to talk about it. V threatens Hellman, and he offers to help them if they come with him to Kang Tao, which V refuses.
Takemura walks into the motel room, interrupting the conversation. Hellman gives V a chip containing a blueprint to V's brain and the biochip. V exits the motel room, leaving Hellman with Takemura. As V leaves, however, their relic malfunctions, and V talks with Silverhand's engram. Once V is finished talking to Silverhand, the mission will end.","Chase the AV.

Approach[]
This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝
Two of Placide's sentries can be found near the Grand Imperial Mall standing by an old vehicle. Upon speaking to them they will direct V to enter the mall via the garage.
The Garage[]
This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝
There are about three Animals enemies standing directly in the garage entryway and a further five further inside the entry way, two of which will leave the complex and the other three are grouped together in the left corner. In order to avoid the first three, head down the right hand side of the ramp, hop over the low wall bordering the ramp, and then keep as close as possible to the building until reaching the first two on the motorcycles, then wait for them to depart then simply walk along the right wall to avoid being seen by the group of three on the left.
The Atrium[]
Placide will warn V before entering the atrium.
The atrium is a large open space on the lower level, with a gallery surrounding it on the upper level. There are around six Animals in the gallery, and 12-18 more on the lower floor, along with a turret.
Enter the atrium in one corner of the gallery. The van, which is the objective, is parked roughly in the middle of the far side, on the lower floor. Immediately in front of V upon entering are a pair of escalators down to the lower floor.
This takes V to a side room on the lower level. If V exit this side room V will soon reach another side room which can be entered. In this room is a server which is connected by a thick cable to the van, which is parked just outside another entrance to this room.
There are three Animals standing immediately outside this second entrance by the van, who are on high alert.
Move around this room to the corner immediately behind this van. Through a glass window here, one can see the left hand side of the van where V need to jack in, but no way was found of breaking the glass in this window without attracting attention.
The Van[]
When jacking into the computer system in the van, V will discover that the NetWatch netrunner is in the cinema on the upper level. Unfortunately, this will also make him aware of V's presence.
The Cinema[]
This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝
V proceeds up to the cinema. If V fought in the atrium, Placide will open a route to it. Following this route, there is one opponent at the top of the escalator going up, Then go round a corner to the movie theater entrance where Sasquatch is keeping guard.
If an alert had been triggered or V are detected by an Animal in the Grand Imperial Mall before, the Netrunner will have preemptively shut the gates to the movie theater and Sasquatch will be waiting for V. Sasquatch will attempt to rush at them and attack with her signature hammer, her attacks are powerful but slow, and will take several seconds between each swing.
However, if V remained undetected throughout the GIM, the gates to the movie theater remain open and it is possible to sneak past Sasquatch without a fight. Being detected by her causes the gates to automatically close and the fight will proceed normally.
While V are fighting with Sasquatch, the Netrunner is trying to spike V's brain and kill them, but with Placide's help, he cannot kill V immediately. V should defeat Sasquatch quickly before the Netrunner manages to kill them. The weakness of Sasquatch is a shining implant on her back, once V destroy the implant, she will get hurt significantly and can no longer recover her health level.
Once Sasquatch is defeated, V finds the NetWatch netrunner Bryce Mosley, in the projection room. He will tell V that the Voodoo Boys are planning to double-cross V. One can choose either to side with him and have the virus removed (and thus prevent the breach of the Blackwall) or knock him out, in which case the virus that Placide uploaded to V earlier will wipe out many Netwatch facilities across the continent, and attempt to kill V as well.
Back to Batty's Hotel[]
After exiting the Mall, Placide's sentries will be waiting outside. They will be shocked to see that V have survived, and nervously offer to take V back to Placide, which can be accepted or declined.

Notes[]
During the dialogue between Brigitte and Placide, they conclude if V is a ""ranyon""[1] or not[2], based on the scans Placide did on V.
The dialogue depends on whether or not V accepted the deal with the NetWatch agent. If so, Placide will call V a ""normal, filthy ranyon""; otherwise, Brigitte will defend V as being ""no ranyon"".
""Ranyon"" is Haitian Creole for ""rag"" or ""floor rag"", as the agent says, meaning ""useful disposable outsider"".
Trivia[]
The title of the job comes from the Johnny Cash song, I Walk the Line.
The movie projected on the screen in the cinema where V confront the NetWatch agent is One-Eyed Jacks, a western from 1961.
References[]

Cassidy Righter (shooting at empty bottles at the southeast end of the camp)
V can join Cassidy's target practice; hitting 12 or more bottles prompts him to offer V his revolver, Amnesty. It is advisable to crouch and aim before Cassidy gives the go.

Jake Scooter from Fortunate Son (playing guitar on a couch by the large camp fire; see also Trivia)

(Don%27t_Fear)_The_Reaper,Act_3,"In order to unlock this ending, players are required to make specific choices at the end of Chippin' In. In order to succeed in this quest, reaching somewhere near maximum level is recommended before attempting.
On the rooftop towards the end of Nocturne Op55N1, V needs to be indecisive in making a decision on who to call for help. After about five minutes of doing nothing and simply leaving the dialog choice open, Johnny will comment that it is tough to decide who ""will die for you"", and proposes they enter Arasaka Tower alone―making this a suicide mission. This echoes Dexter DeShawn's question in the beginning:
""Would you rather live in peace as Mr. Nobody... or go down for all times in a blaze of glory?""
Two factors make this mission uniquely difficult:
Saving is not allowed throughout the entire mission. However, the game still autosaves at checkpoints, the first being at the start of the mission, the second after descending to the mainframe level, and the third immediately before the confrontation with Adam Smasher.
V's max Health will be lowered by 25% at the start of the mission, and gradually decreases by an additional 1% at certain intervals, indicated by the ""Relic Malfunction Detected"" notification. The longer it takes to complete the mission, the harder it gets to survive.
A level in the mid-40s or higher as well as good equipment is therefore advisable.
Dying at any point will result in a credit roll, which will prompt video messages identical to the ""easy way out""/suicide ending. Although the game will not offer to ""load last save"" and cut to credits instantly, it can be resumed from the autosave points mentioned above.
Choosing Johnny's ""suicide run"" option will result in an immediate cut right to the front entrance of Arasaka Tower. In the entrance area, V will have to fight two Arasaka Samurais and three Arasaka Special Agents who are all at maximum level. After defeating the guards along with two Arasaka mechs, Johnny leads V to the elevator for which an access token is needed. More guards will spawn and they will have to be defeated in order for the token to be looted. As V obtains the access token, they will have to call for the lift, which will only arrive after a significant amount of time, leaving V in the lobby having to defend against guards that will spawn from time to time, including Juggernauts - their Mk.31 HMGs will prove very useful, and by the time you run out of ammo, another juggernaut will have appeared. It is advisable to retreat to the entrance area and fight the guards from there as they will enter the elevator area from two sides. Using a wall-penetrating Tech Sniper Rifle like the Tsunami Nekomata can make the fights here and throughout the mission decisively easier. Enter the elevator immediately after the door opens, and select the Netrunner floor. Another Mech will spawn in front of the elevator before its doors close. The Short Circuit quickhack is a good way to quickly and effectively deal with the Mechs throughout this mission.
There are very few advantageous locations from which to fight multiple enemies after reaching the elevator. It is advised to bring the best guns and armor and stock up on ammo and meds before proceeding, but these can also be crafted between combat (and in the elevator). Enemies spawn as V reaches certain checkpoints, and therefore it is difficult to hide and pick them off. Your final enemy will be Adam Smasher, who will summon reinforcements at preset points during the fight: 6 Arasaka Snipers appear on the balcony around the room and three Juggernauts on the ground level.
Once Alt is successfully uploaded to the access point and is connected to Mikoshi, she will offer V a choice to either give their body to Johnny, or to keep it. Choosing Johnny results in the New Dawn Fades (Temperance) ending, whereas choosing V will result in the Path of Glory (The Sun) ending, albeit modified by the fact that Rogue is still alive in both.","Find a way to the level with Mikoshi.

Changes,Act_3,"As long as the ending path ends with V connecting into Mikoshi (hence this excludes the Arasaka and Phantom Liberty paths), the player will be presented with this mission.
Changes can start in one of two ways, which depends on the choice the player makes regarding Jackie's body after The Heist. However, the mission will open up in similar fashion; V will be presented with a vision of them going to the ninth floor behind Misty's shop, as is what happened during the third half of Nocturne Op55N1.
If V took Jackie's body to Viktor Vektor after thus resulting in Arasaka stealing his engram, V will be given one last chance to talk to him.
If V took Jackie's body to Mama Welles or if the body was left in the Delamain Cab they escaped on, upon exiting into the roof, V finds their bullet necklace and takes it as the world around them fades away.
Either way, this will lead to the cyberspace inside Mikoshi. Alt Cunningham will recite a poem (both listed below) as V walks towards the beam of light, taking them into another section of cyberspace. After doing so, V will have a talk.
If the mission prior to this is Belly of the Beast or (Don't Fear) The Reaper, V will talk to Johnny Silverhand.
If the previous mission was Knockin' on Heaven's Door, the opposite will happen, as Johnny by that point had taken control of V's body.
The conversation soon shifts into a shocking realization for V; with Alt having separated their and Johnny's psyches throughout the raid on Arasaka Tower, the extended exposure to Johnny's construct has irreparably damaged their body. Alt gives them a choice; return to their body with six months to live, or let Johnny keep their body.
What follows after Changes if V returns to their body depends on the previous mission. If the previous mission was (Don't Fear) The Reaper or Knockin' on Heaven's Door, Changes will always lead to Path of Glory. If the previous mission was Belly of the Beast, the next mission will be All Along the Watchtower.
If Changes ends with Johnny keeping their body, the mission will always lead to New Dawn Fades, disregarding the previous mission and any ending path.","Go to the roof.

Things_Done_Changed,Epilogue,"Two years after accepting Solomon Reed's offer, in 2079, V wakes up from a medically induced coma in Edward Kernaghan Military Medical Center with Reed at their side. Reed explains to V that the operation to remove the relic was successful, but that due to the procedure V's brain became permanently damaged and unable to handle cyberware.
Solomon Reed proceeds to give V a job offer from the NUSA goverment, so that they can at least continue living, and allows V to reach out to their friends.

If V romanced Judy:
Judy will also apologize to V and ask her not to try and ruin their marriage, effectively ending their relationship.
If V calls Panam Palmer:
Panam won't answer the call, and V leaves her a phone message. Mitch Anderson sends V a video message during the epilogue saying she doesn't want to talk to them, and that it would be best if V does not try to call her again. If V romanced her, the relationship is ended.
If V calls River Ward:
River Ward is angry at first, but gives V a chance to explain that they just woke up from two years of coma, after which River apologizes. After suggesting meeting up, River reveals that he sold everything he knew about the NCPD to Trauma Team to earn some money to pay for Randy's rehab, and as a consequence, he is now a wanted man. Ashamed of himself, he's unable to face V in person and ends the call. If romanced, the relationship is ended.
If V calls Kerry Eurodyne:
Kerry Eurodyne is happy to hear from V but is also busy and constantly interrupted during his call as he's at the Crystal Palace on a concert tour, admitting that he doesn't have time for V at the moment. If romanced, he promises to reunite with V once the tour is over in a few months.
Afterwards, V returns to Night City and takes a Delamain cab to Viktor's clinic (which is now a Zetatech franchise), having opportunities to talk with those two about what has changed in Night City. Viktor will also concur with the NUSA doctors, stating that V's motor cortex appears to have ""turned deaf to implant signals"".
After leaving Viktor's, V is accosted and beaten by a single street thug, a sad reminder of how weak they've become. Misty Olszewski arrives and helps V up. She shares that she is moving to Poland, and gives V advice on living as an average citizen. V can express various outlooks on their life and goals. In a cutscene, Misty leaves, and V fades into a crowd.","Talk to Reed.

After getting up, you will take a shower where you are optionally joined by Judy/Kerry/River. While having coffee in the kitchen, your optional partner will voice concerns about you and your relationship. You will then have to join your partner on the balcony, where they bid farewell before you leave to do a critical job. Your dialog choices cannot alter the basic outcomes of these dialogues: Kerry and River will promise to wait for you; the status with Panam will remain ambiguous but hopeful; Judy will break up.
Before you depart, you can check your working room. There are messages about the upcoming job on V's computer. Johnny's Samurai jacket is hanging on the wall, you can wear it.

During the surgery in the Arasaka Tower's Medical Center—to have the Relic prototype with Johnny Silverhand's engram removed—V and Johnny speak with each other one last time in cyberspace before being separated. They reminisce on their time together,
After the surgery, V is transported to the Arasaka Orbital Station, where they wake up in the clinic for the first time since the surgery and start their recovery. After a short conversation with their doctor, Professor Sachiko Kusama, they are escorted to their room, and go to sleep.
During their first night's sleep, V has a nightmare in which they hear still Johnny's voice. The voice draws V to the door, which they open and gaze upon the vast emptiness of space, before leaping into it, causing them to wake up. After waking up, a WNS report on the television reveals that Saburo Arasaka has taken over the body of his son, Yorinobu Arasaka, while they hold a speech on television ensuring that the Arasaka Corporation will go back to its roots and be stronger than ever. As the news broadcast ends, Professor Kusama enters the room to see how V's recovery is going with various tests, such as reading text from a monitor, solving a Rubik's cube, responding, responding to keywords, and motor functions test using treadmill. After the tests, V goes back to sleep, and has another nightmare.
V hears Johnny once more while sleeping, and again drawing them to the door. This time the door opens to the hallway of the station. Upon exploring the hallway, V relives the memory of Jackie's death, with the Relic being inserted again into their neuroport.
V wakes up again, and this day a news report by N54 news is on the television, still reporting on Saburo Arasaka's apparent resurrection and 
that numerous Virtu 100 Company CEO's, religious leaders, and human rights groups have signed a letter of protest. Professor Kusama enters V's room again, to subject V to more tests, which after completion allow V to use the communications system.
If V calls Viktor Vektor:

V calls Viktor Vektor and he picks up. Viktor tells V that they want them to visit him for a check-up after returning to Earth. Viktor also tells V that Misty Olszewski is visiting family in Warsaw.

Before ending the call, Kerry tells V that they will make the necessary calls to get them back safely to Night City.
If V calls Hanako Arasaka:

Hanako Arasaka did not pick up when V called her.

While V is asleep that night, they dream about the tests, eventually breaking open the Rubik's Cube which reveals an image of a Devil.

As the tests go on for the new few weeks, V grows increasingly annoyed at them. Eventually V reaches a breaking point, and becomes aggressive, causing the Professor to hastily leave the room.

As long as you surrendered Songbird to the NUSA during The Killing Moon or Somewhat Damaged, V will have the option of a cure no matter what they say during subsequent quests. You will receive a call/text from Solomon Reed, with the option to decline their help and end the quest; or accept their aid, leading you to the rooftop of Misty's Esoterica. A conversation with Johnny Silverhand will ensue, and afterwards the option to call Solomon will appear. This call option also appears during Nocturne Op55N1.","Wait a day for Reed to contact you.

New_Dawn_Fades,Epilogue,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Not completely following the Manual of Style]
Johnny Silverhand, now in V's body, wakes up in an apartment at the West Wind Apartments in West Wind Estate, Pacifica as they try to get used to their new life. Before heading, he gathers his things and checks an automated text from the North Oak Columbarium, telling him to pay for their order within 24 hours before it'll be cancelled.[N 1]
If you did Knockin' on Heaven's Door following this ending:
Johnny picks up Rogue Amendiares's gun, Pride, off a shelf and apologizes for getting her killed.
Taking a Night City Bus Ticket, he says he's ""Got a bit of time. Think I'll manage to swing by and visit you two."", mentioning that he'll ask Steve for a ride. After Johnny gets his bag and leaves the apartment, he visits a kid Johnny befriended named Steve Sanchez, calling him via his intercom as he comes out of his apartment to greet them (depending on your V's gender).
Johnny can ask about Steve's bruise on his eye, to which Steve responds that his dad beat him for not waking him up in time for work, to which Johnny can comfort them in either option, telling them it happens or offer to give them his alarm clock to him.
Johnny can also ask if they have been improving their skills, to which Steve sheepishly admits he's been botching them, to which you can tell him that he'll get it eventually, or that his technique doesn't matter and he'll find his own flow.
But primarily, Johnny can ask him for a ride to which he'll head out of the apartment. But outside, Henry Sanchez- Steve's Dad, gets mad at Steve for planning to going out on his own, and then attacks him for taking his car keys.
Johnny can tell him to leave Henry alone, play it cool and tell Henry that Steve's just going to be driving him and he'll be back in two hours, or respond aggressively, telling him he'd stay if Steve had a real home and a scumbag of a dad that didn't beat him. Either way, Henry lets you and Steve go and you can hear Henry complain to his friends about the ""terrible influence"" Johnny/V has had on Steve, to which they encourage him to beat him again next time if you stay close to him long enough.
On the car ride to Time Machine, Steve and Johnny talk about Kerry Eurodyne who shopped there one time, discussing about a rumor about Kerry using Johnny's death as a means to get to fame, to which Johnny retorts that ""Can't do much about media vultures. Got shit for brains, 'specially the ones who cover music;"" as well as complimenting Kerry's skills as a musician.
Steve talks about his dream for being a musician, to which Johnny can tell him that he'll need a backup plan so he doesn't get desperate, as well as that being a musician isn't the easiest gig, that hard work and practice are the start- but that it'll get harder and that he'll have to get used to the ""critics, haters, non-stop pressure, batshit crazy lifestyle.."", remarking that it can chew him up. Primarily, Johnny tells him that he's gotta start writing songs and practice, with Steve saying that he doesn't know what to write about. Johnny can tell him that he can write for the people, write with what you know about, or write the truth. Either way, he'll advise Henry that since he's still young, ideas will come as he can give himself enough time.
Arriving at Time Machine, Johnny and Steve get out as they check out the store for a guitar, asking the Owner for a ""Six-string. Electric."" She'll gesture to the nearby wall, to which you can scan three guitars- Anima Rebel, Ardor Session, and Noise Contagion- and Johnny can give his critiques on each of the three, pointing out flaws in the guitars. He tells the Owner that he's looking for ""a real instrument"", and is willing to pay ""real money"".
The Store Owner takes Johnny and Steve to the back, showcasing the newest guitars, with her pointing out the ""vintage axes"" in the back- a Deluze Orphean and Tenzor Paradize. You can ask about either of them, before picking one to test out and tune. He compliments V's playing style, saying that he never knew anyone who could play Silverhand so well and how he read that Silverhand was ""..self-taught."" and ""Made up his own style."" Surprised, he asks how V/Johnny can play so effectively, to which Johnny can either tell him that he is Johnny reborn, which Johnny can choose to explain or not tell him, or to tell him to devote his time and effort into practicing, and he can come up with his own style like Johnny.
Johnny offers Steve the guitar he chose, allowing him to strum a tune as he talked about Rockers being rebels and how they weren't afraid to speak their minds, saying that he tried it once with his dad, mentioning that it didn't end well. Johnny can tell him that being a real rebel means being authentic, or that it needs time to develop. After the conversation, Johnny heads back to the Store Owner and pays 5000€$ (Eurodollars/Eddies) for the guitar, before heading back to the car with Steve as they drive towards the Cemetery.
On the radio, you can hear about Yorinobu abandoning peace talks with Militech as they prepare for an impending war, with Steve asking Johnny if it's likely to happen, to which Johnny can tell him he doesn't care about it, or that there won't be another war.
Steve will talk about a friend of his who lives nearby, saying that he likes driving through the area, to which Johnny can tell him that the city feels alive and it feels like Frankenstein's Monster, and that it's nice to drive through, noting that he never had the time to sit back and appreciate the view as it slipped through his fingers. Steve asks if he's planning to write a song about it, but Johnny responds with a ""maybe.""
Steve can ask about Rogue's gun, complimenting it and mentioning his dad used to sell them, and following up and asked Johnny if he was planning to shoot anyone with it. Johnny can either respond ""Not without a reason."" or ""It's a memento.""
Arriving at the Columbarium, Johnny tells Steve to wait in the car while he pays 4000€$ at the Columbarium for two spots for the next 100 years- one for Rogue and one for V.
For V, Johnny put the Bullet Pendant in the container, saying that he can't hold onto it anymore, thanking him for everything, his epitaph reading ""Dreamer"".[N 2]
For Rogue, he put Pride in the container, saying that she'd still be Queen of the Afterlife if not for him, saying that ""Yeah, we fuckin' got 'em."", and apologizing for dragging her into it and getting her killed, her epitaph reading ""Queen of the Afterlife"".
Leaving the Columbarium and meeting Steve outside, Johnny can take the cigarette out of Steve's hand, saying that he ""Gave all that up. So should you."", saying that ""It's bad for your body. Bad for your soul."" Steve asks what now, to which Johnny can either respond that he can go home or that he's got a bus to catch, to which Steve asks about the friend Johnny visited, noting that he misses her. He responds saying that when his grandpa died, he missed him a lot.
Eventually, Johnny boards the bus and puts in his ticket, loading his bag as he takes a seat and the cinematic plays.
Sitting back before Johnny leaves, Steve urges the bus to stop, saying that Johnny left the guitar he bought. Johnny responds, saying that he can keep it. As the bus pulls away, Johnny takes off their shades as they look out the window and the bus begins to leave Night City once and for all.","Read the notification from the Automated Delivery System.

All_Along_the_Watchtower,Epilogue,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: none given]
Several weeks have passed after the raid on Arasaka Tower[N 1], and V wakes up in Panam Palmer's Warhorse at the Coronado Dam overlooking Night City. Panam and V talk about how far they've come since they met, which is interrupted by V coughing up blood- a sign of their worsening condition; as well as their plans to leave Night City with the rest of the Aldecaldos to head for Arizona, along with all the plundered loot they've stolen from the corporation and discuss plans to use their connections to try and save V's life.
After talking, Panam heads back to her car, telling V to take their time looking at the city one more time before they get in the car and head to meet up with the others. As they ride to the Solar Arrays in Jackson Plains, they are joined by Mitch Anderson, who playfully teases Panam about the upcoming sandstorm as they drive to the meeting point.
Once arrived at the Solar Arrays, V talks with the other Aldecaldos–Cassidy Righter and Carol Emeka–before rejoining Mitch and Panam, who discuss using a famous Aldecaldo Tunnel to evade both Arasaka, who'll be looking for their stolen tech at every checkpoint, and Border Patrol, who'll want to stop any trespassers who try to jump the Border Crossing.[N 2]
If V has high enough Body:
V inquires Panam and Mitch about the possible security measures that the SoCal Border Patrol will have on the way to the tunnel, which Panam will respond by telling V to not worry, explaining that they'll know what to do, as well as mentioning that Cassidy and Carol will also help distract Arasaka from ever finding them.
Mitch and Panam tell V that after they escape through the tunnel, they'll collapse it to prevent anyone from following them, then making their way towards the meeting point with the rest of the Aldecaldos, then altogether moving towards Tuscon. Panam reassures V, telling them they won't be alone anymore starting today.
Boarding the Basilisk, the group charge across the Badlands and against the upcoming sandstorm, with V and Panam following them not far behind as they use it as cover to escape the Border Patrol drones, with Cassidy and Carol breaking off to distract them as planned, wishing them good luck. Heading to the tunnel entrance, V hands the controls to Panam, who use the modded Turbothrusters to ram through and into the tunnel, before making their way out the other side.
Having left Night City, the following ending cinematic will play where V will get out of the Basilisk to sit back and take in the night air as it hovers across the open water. Sitting back, V looks at the bullet pendant they received from Misty Olszewski, before taking it off and letting go of the necklace.","Join Panam.

MaxTac has captured Songbird, so V and Solomon Reed need to break her out.
V will need to call in a favor from a netrunner contact to gain intel on the MaxTac convoy transporting Songbird. Depending on what missions have been previously completed, V can call the following netrunners:
Nix - Delivers V data after 6 hours at the Arasaka Memorial; gives V a frontal cortex implant Self-ICE to aid in fighting MaxTac. Requires completing KOLD MIRAGE with Nix alive.
Sandra Dorsett - Delivers V data after 8 hours at Reconciliation Park; requests V to install a Trojan virus into MaxTac in return. Requires completing Full Disclosure and pick up the Intelligence dialogue option.
Chang-Hoon Nam - Delivers V data after 12 hours at his shop in Japantown; suffers from aphasia after hack and will leave Night City. Requires completing Gig: Wakako's Favorite.
Carol Emeka - Refuses to provide V the data, but sends either a weapon or quick hack to aid in fighting MaxTac. Requires advancing on Panam Palmer's side quests.
Alternatively, V can pay Mr. Hands €$15,000 to enlist his netrunner Yoko Tsuru, who completes the job in 10 hours, and provides an additional objective to send Mr. Hands coordinates of the ambush.
After retrieving the data, V will meet up with Reed and members of the 6th Street gang in an abandoned hotel in Pacifica overlooking a skybridge.
Before the MaxTac convoy arrives, a 6th Street soldier will overview the planned ambush. V can select placement of either turrets or mines, as well as review 3 possible starting positions. At the start of the ambush V, Reed, and supporting 6th Street gang members will need to first eliminate the NCPD escort, followed by a squad of four MaxTac officers.
Songbird will escape with the MaxTac truck. Following the path of the truck leads V to Songbird and directly into the quest Somewhat Damaged.","Call a netrunner to help breach MaxTac.

You_Know_My_Name,Phantom_Liberty,"After acquiring the plans from Mr. Hands, V enters the Black Sapphire via the flooded tunnels that connect to the maintenance area of the hotel. After an underwater section at the tunnels and defeating some enemies at the maintenance zone, they are tasked with helping with making a meet with Solomon Reed.
To unite, a bridge must be drawn and Reed has access to the control panel. V has to take control of a mounted Rasetsu sniper rifle and help gather intel and eliminate targets to securely escort Reed to the panel. Reuniting with Reed, they take the elevator up to the party and infiltrate.
After reaching the floor, they join the party where lots of celebrities or important figures of Night City are. After a while, as she promised, Songbird reaches out to V. Songbird says that Kurt Hansen has the cure, which she is expected to work on with two netrunners who are currently attending the party. She is then whisked away by Hansen and she re-establishes the connection via the Relic.
To attend the upcoming meeting that Hansen, Songbird and the two netrunners are going to have, V needs to impersonate one of the runners. To impersonate them, V needs to have their behavioral imprints scanned. V joins the netrunner siblings playing roulette. To scan their behavior, V asks the siblings questions to provoke emotions from them to get scanned. Just as the roulette game ends, Hansen joins them and says that he knows that V is an NUS agent, threatening V and kicking V and Reed out the hotel. They then leaves the party and then is escorted out of the hotel.","Enter the flooded tunnels.

If the playthrough is started normally:
Sometime after resolving the meeting with the Voodoo Boys and Alt Cunningham, V is contacted by a mysterious individual who introduces herself as Songbird.
After contacting V, Songbird will direct them towards Dogtown's northern gate. There she will explain that the plane she is flying in, the Space Force One, will land somewhere in Dogtown. V's mission is to access the district and rescue President Myers before BARGHEST captures her. To convince V to do the job, Songbird promises them a cure that will save their lives. Additionally, and to prove she is serious, Songbird gives the merc a Militech sofware that unlocks new abilities which V can use through the Relic. More of these are scattered around Dogtown in abandoned Militech terminals.
After finishing the conversation, Songbird leads V to the EBM Petrochem Stadium's underground parking garage, which V can access by either sneaking or fighting their way into it.[S 1]","Talk to the mystery caller.

This quest starts after receiving the Behavioral Imprint-synced Faceplate from Farida Nazeri, and exiting her clinic.
V calls Reed, who tells them that the connection to Charon Exotics that they made in Birds with Broken Wings was severed and that the plan is now to move to the Dogtown Gate to find a vantage point near the Golden Pacific Data Term and scout out the ride themselves.
After V waits several hours just before midnight, they are instructed by Reed to scan vehicles coming from Night City into Dogtown, as one of them has to be the vehicle that Aurore Cassel and Aymeric Cassel rented during their stay in Night City.
Aurore and Aymeric drive a Quadra Sport R-7 ""Charon"", that is tracked once tagged. After tagging the vehicle, V intercepts the vehicle at a parking lot below Eden Plaza, and climb inside the vehicle's trunk and connects to its security system.
If V fails to tag the car when it is entering Dogtown:
Reed will instruct V to move to plan C, and sends V coordinates to three different locations where they must go and scan for the car.
The duo eventually returns to their vehicle, ready to depart to the EBM Petrochem Stadium and meet with Kurt Hansen and Songbird.
If V decides to listen to Aurore and Aymeric's conversation:
V overhears a conversation about Slider's death and a possible stash that is hidden.[N 1]
Their vehicle would be taken over by V—luring them into the FIA trap that was set for them—and driving them straight to the garage where Solomon Reed and Alena Xenakis are waiting.
Once arrived at the garage, Aurore and Aymeric are killed and V and Alex prepared to take on their identities. In order to do so, V had to link with Aurore's body and download files on Cynosure.
If V overheard Aurore and Aymeric's conversation about Slider's stash:
V can download the file ""Blind_n_Dead"" from Aurore's body.[N 1]
After taking control of the vehicle V tries to drive to the meeting location while the netrunners try to get back the control and drive back to the stadium every time they do like a rope pull game. When V brings the car to the meeting point garage Reed and Alex will stun and execute the netrunners then V can download the files from Aurore's corpse. Having downloaded the required files, V slips into the netrunner suit and enters the vehicle and activates the behavioral imprint for their faceplate. After performing a small test to see if it is working, Alex and V depart for their meeting with Kurt Hansen and Songbird.
If V does not take over the vehicle until they arrive at the Stadium:
The guards will perform a scan of the car, revealing V's position in the trunk. They will then proceed to fry V's circuits, inevitably leading to V's death.","Call Reed.

If V is spotted by any cameras while escorting Myers through the subway tunnels, there is a laptop in a room at the end of the righthand route that can be used to wipe the camera recordings.
If one does not wipe the recordings, a group of Barghest soldiers will ambush V and Reed on their drive back to the hideout, with more at the building's lobby upon arrival. If Jacob and Taylor were convinced to help shelter Myers, they will be found dead.
If you kill Jacob and Taylor, you'll need to pick up one of the bodies, whereby a minor time skip follows with the bodies being disposed.
If you spare them, once you manage to enlist Reed for help, they'll be killed off later.
The telephone in the restaurant can have different numbers dialed in, which will make different sounds play through the phone and even elicit reactions from Johnny.

V needs to get in touch with the local fixer Mr. Hands to get intel about Black Sapphire. To have a meeting arranged V has to do gigs for Mr. Hands and make him trust them more.
After having done at least 3 Gigs for him, he invites V to Heavy Hearts to have a chat. Hands will talk about his plan to undermine Kurt Hansen and talk about the origins of Dogtown. Later Hands will give you the plans of Black Sapphire.
After V leaves Heavy Hearts V will call Reed and he will ask V to join him and Alex over at The Moth. After reaching The Moth V will collapse due to Relic malfunction and Reed will proceed to tell his backstory to V and lead them down to Alex's hideout where he will talk about his past with his old crew including Songbird until Alex shows up.
After arriving at her hideout Alex will lay down the plan she set up to breach into Black Sapphire.[N 1]","Call Mr. Hands.

Somewhat_Damaged,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Walkthrough needs to be rewritten from V's perspective, removal of bullet points and pseudo-headers]
Search for Songbird
From the hole in the wall, head down to the crashed MaxTac truck. Searching the truck reveals traces of the Blackwall, which acts as a trail to Songbird. To continue following the traces, V will need to force open two sealed gates (20 Body Attribute check) or bypass them by finding a floor exit panel and swimming through flooded passageways. V can briefly chat with Johnny Silverhand before plunging down a deep shaft. Exit the water, and continue following the Blackwall traces until V reaches a room with a terminal and Cynosure logo, marking the outskirts of the Cynosure Facility. Jack in to trigger a conversation with Reed. Johnny will add some comments based on whether the player has completed Shot by Both Sides or not. Songbird will cut off communication before talking with V as well.
Descend Deeper into the Cynosure Facility
Use the elevator to descend further down. Songbird will sever communication with Johnny, leaving V to continue alone. Proceed through the facility until V sees a ""memory"" of Songbird talking with Hansen, followed by a brief conversation with Songbird. Next to the terminal where the two are speaking, you can find a Site Map of the facility, which can be toggled like the dossiers in Firestarter. Afterwards, V must force open a door (Body Attribute check).
Bypass the Lockdown
Continue onward until you see Songbird, standing just past the gateway to a new area. If approached, Songbird will close the entry gate and initiate a lockdown protocol preventing V from reaching her. To continue, V must deactivate the lockdown by disabling data terminals Alpha and Bravo.
Disable Alpha: Enter the Server Room with a Body Attribute check to force open the closed shutters. Then, jack into terminal Alpha using your personal link and complete a Breach Protocol.
Disable Bravo: After disabling Alpha, the floor exit gate in this room will open. Drop down and proceed until you take a ladder up to terminal Bravo. Once again, jack in with your personal link. Songbird will prevent your hacking attempts, but scanning the terminal will reveal power cables. Crawl under the terminal to unplug and disable Bravo.
Escape Cerberus
As V crawls from under Bravo, a ceiling grate will fall onto V, followed by a Militech Cerberus controlled by Songbird. Remove the grate, then watch a brief scripted sequence before regaining control of V. Run away from Cerberus into the only open room. On the left is an open floor exit panel V can use to hide. Drop through the opening, then continue until you reach a ladder that takes V to the Living Quarters. Another copy of the Site Map can be found on a bed. The next room has another ""memory"" of Songbird undergoing surgery by the FIA.
Failing to remove the grate in time or getting caught by Cerberus will result in a game over.
Before dropping down the floor exit, another Site Map shard can be found by the computers.
Cerberus will now hunt V throughout Cynosure. Use the Gameplay Tips below for help surviving.
Reach Engineering and Disable Sierra
V's next destination is Engineering. Either exit through the door directly across from Engineering with a Body Attribute check, or exit through the doors across from Administration, go right then right again at the hallway intersection. Enter Engineering, and to V's right is the room housing terminal Sierra. To disable, jack in with V's personal link and complete a Breach Protocol. This will alert Cerberus to V's location; once it is safe, leave Engineering and move on to the next terminal.
Reach Security and Disable Victor
V's next destination is Security. Exit Engineering, go right until the hallways intersect, then right again towards the Sector 3 gate. Security will be the second door on the left. This first room has a Site Map shard, and the second has an area V can use to hide on the left. Continue to the final room with terminal Victor. To disable, jack in with V's personal link and complete a Breach Protocol. As you leave Security, V will see another ""memory"" of Songbird standing after her surgery. Now on to the gate.
Obtain Erebus Crafting Specs (Optional)
Across from the entrance to Engineering is Maintenance, but the door panel is disabled. Turn left, enter the Storage Area, and head to the back room. On the wall is a Distribution Box V can rewire using their Technical Ability, powering the door panel. Return to the door panel and enter Maintenance; the Erebus crafting specs will be directly ahead. V can leave through the doors, or take the ladders up to the ceiling vents. Heading through the vent lets V can drop down into Section 3, just past the gate.
Exiting via the vents will lock V out of the previous area but also bypasses disabling Sierra and Victor.
Open the Gate and Proceed to Sector 3
Interact with the terminal and wait for the gate to unseal. Head into Section 3, and soon V will need to run from Cerberus. Flee down the only path forward until V reaches an airlock door. Enter then close the door behind V, and wait for the airlock to cycle. Once V can continue, proceed to the next airlock and another ""memory"" of Myers and Songbird taking the oath. Leave once the airlock cycles and continue following the Blackwall traces to Core Control.
Shutdown the Core
Talk with Songbird, then interact with the terminal and initiate a shutdown of the core. Three subsystems remain online and require manual shutdown. Turn around to leave and see another ""memory"" of Reed talking with Songbird. Next, head into Labs.
Neural Network: Enter Labs, and the Neural Network Room is to V's left, with the entrance across from another ""memory"" of Songbird. Once inside, find and unplug 3 cables connected to the subsystem. Cerberus will arrive and resume hunting V.
Datafront Central Command: Instead of heading left, head forward and enter the Observation Room. To the left is the door to the 1st room of Datafront Central Command, followed by the 2nd room and 3rd room. V will need to destroy 6 firewall devices to disable the subsystem. 2 are located in the 1st room and 4 are in the 3rd. Each time you destroy a firewall device Cerberus will come down from one of three vents and hunt V. The three vents are located in the 1st and 3rd room, and one outside of the Datafront Central Command entrance.
Thermic Control: Enter the Observation Room. Head forward and enter Thermic Control. Either directly hack the terminal with a high Intelligence check, or scan the terminal to track the cables to an electrical panel. Open the nearby shutters, then climb out and override the electrical panel disabling the subsystem. Climb back in and see another ""memory"" of Reed and Songbird.
Experimental Prototyping room: this area, near the neural network and observation rooms, Intelligence or by entering the code 714212. Inside, you can find blueprints for the Militech Canto cyberdeck.
Enter the Core
Evade Cerberus as you make your way back to Core Control. There is one more ""memory"" in the Observation Room. Upon reaching Core Control, interact with the terminal to trigger a scripted sequence and the conclusion. Retrieve the Behavioral system component from the fallen Cerberus. All that remains is to finish talking with Songbird and then decide her fate in Leave in Silence.","Investigate the area.

Firestarter,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Should be rewritten as a story walkthrough from V's perspective]
Immediately following I've Seen That Face Before, V and Alena Xenakis (disguised as the Cassel twins) drive to the stadium. The pair is greeted by Albert Murphy, a Barghest soldier, upon arrival. Murphy escorts V and Alex, informing the pair that Barghest is alerted to a possible FIA operation, and that the pair needs to deposit their weapons in a locker before meeting with Hansen.
During the meeting, Hansen tests the identities of V and Alex. Too many incorrect responses will trigger an immediate game-over. You can use the dossier and knowledge of previous quests for hints on responding. Correct responses will differ depending on which twin V impersonates. Some incorrect responses can be saved with a valid follow-up response or with 20 Cool.
As Aurore Cassel:
When offered a drink, take the drink.
On gambling at the Black Sapphire, answer according to whether the twins won or lost the final bet in You Know My Name.
While in prison, Aurore spent time in the VIP wing, and would not know prisoners from other cell blocks.
Aurore is a fan of Kerry Eurodyne's style.
Aurore is marked for death by France's underworld, so working with them would either be impossible or require a significant payout for the risk.
As Aymeric Cassel:
On gambling at the Black Sapphire, answer according to whether the twins won or lost the final bet in You Know My Name.
When asked about a classic car, answer that you were interested in the Porsche 911.
When offered a drink, either don't take the drink or give it to Aurore.
Aymeric does not remember their time with Petrochem, as their memories for those years were stolen.
After talking with Hansen, Songbird will arrive and lead V to the Neural Matrix. From here, V can help Songbird escape or help Reed capture Songbird. Phantom Liberty's main storyline will branch off depending on V's choice.
V betrays Solomon Reed:
After acquiring the Neural Matrix, it's time to signal Alex to eliminate Hansen. Songbird will breach the stadium, opening your escape route with her providing support via hacks. If you return to Hansen's body, you can loot two of his weapons: Bald Eagle and Wild Dog. Continue and navigate the first area to retrieve V's weapons. Afterward, proceed through the market area. Murphy will arrive - sneak around him or defeat and loot him for the iconic weapon Murphy's Law. Continue working towards the exit, avoiding or fighting a few drones. Once you reach the homeless camp, continue following the prompts until you both drive away, completing the quest and starting The Killing Moon.[N 1]
V betrays Songbird:
After obtaining the Neural Matrix, Songbird will alert Hansen to the ruse. Hansen eliminates Alex, while V's ICEbreaker neutralizes Songbird's attack. Songbird escapes in the ensuing cinematic, creating an opening for V to follow. Navigate the stadium, collecting V's weapons on your way. At the market entrance, Hansen and several Barghest soldiers will ambush V. Hansen starts the fight with his light machine gun and revolver. At 50% health, Hansen switches to a knife and charges V. Defeat Hansen and loot him for his weapons: Bald Eagle, Fang, and Wild Dog. Descend to the parking garage and escape the stadium with Reed.

Prerequisites: For this quest to appear, one needs to have obtained one or both of the crafting specs for the Erebus or Militech Canto, and have looted the behavioral system component from the Cerberus during Somewhat Damaged.
About 24 hours after completing Somewhat Damaged, V will receive a message from an unknown number and party interested in the aforementioned items retrieved from the Cynosure Facility. V will be directed to meet with Yoko Tsuru at Kabuki Roundabout, who will take a few hours to decrypt the algorithm on the behavioral system component.

Birds_with_Broken_Wings,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Not written correctly, missing information]
After breaching the party at Black Sapphire and stealing the identities of the two netrunners that will attend a meeting with Kurt Hansen and Songbird, Alex and Reed tell V to meet them at the basement of The Moth to discuss what comes next. The plan is to intercept the netrunners assume their identity and meet Hansen and snatch both the matrix and Songbird also killing Hansen for attempting an assassination on the president.
The plan is to hack into Charon Exotics and take control of the netrunners vehicle. To do that Alex instructs V to go to a tracking station of Charon Exotics and install the encryption key. But as V leaves The Moth Songbird reaches out to V and asks them to meet her to talk in private.
If V meets with Songbird:
Songbird asks V to come to a spot that she likes and reminisces about old times. Then after V confronts her, she confesses that she was the one who told Hansen about when and where Space Force One would be. She tells V that her real plan was for her and V to run away with the matrix and save the president, but that her getting captured changed everything. Her plan is to escape from Hansen and to give the matrix to a ripper who can help both her and V.
If V has sufficiently high Intelligence, V only needs to visit one Charon Exotics tracking station by choosing to remote access the second tracking station. If not, the second transceiver is broken and a kid named Luka can be paid 1000 Eurodollars to play a hot or cold game to restart the transceiver. After receiving the data, V needs to wait a couple hours for Reed to contact them. While waiting Alex reaches out and invites V to The Moth to kick back a little.
At The Moth V and Alex talk about who they would want to be if they weren't who they are now. They bond and V can choose to dance if they choose to.
A few hours later Reed calls and tells V to see a specific ripperdoc to get an implant that will allow V to use the biometrics of the netrunners. Reed also plans on taking Songbird with him but thinks he needs to ICE her first so implants a module to ICE Songbird into V as well.
as V gets the implants they talk to Johnny about the predicament that they are in. One side is a woman trying to survive as a living nuke, potentially dragging you with them to the explosion, while the other side is a man that runs on principles trying to do good by them potentially ready to mess up the entire situation. Leaving the ripperdoc finishes the mission.","Wait a day for a call from Reed.

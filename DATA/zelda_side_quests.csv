EX Treasure: Fairy Clothes is a side quest from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is unlocked upon installation of the DLC Pack ""The Master Trials"". It requests Link to find and read the Misko's EX Journal at the Outpost Ruins. The quest guides Link toward the ""fairy clothes"" treasures, three new Treasure Chests containing the ""Tingle's Outfit"". The treasures containing the Tingle's Hood, Shirt and Tights are respectively buried in the middle of the Exchange Ruins, near the ruins of the Castle Town Prison, and the southeast of the Mabe Village Ruins."
https://zelda-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Hunt_for_the_Giant_Horse,"At the Mounted Archery Camp in the Faron Grasslands, Link encounters a young man named Straia who is doing an ecological survey of the area. He tells Link about a wild Giant Horse rumored to live in the Taobab Grasslands and asks him if he will bring it to him as mounted Bokoblins and two powerful Lynels make entering the grasslands where it is found extremely dangerous. Electric Keese also appear at night so its best to tame it during the morning.
Link can either choose to simply avoid these enemies and head to the grasslands, either by horse or scaling the nearby cliffs or paragliding down from the southern part of the Great Plateau which boarders the grasslands. Alternatively he can kill all these enemies which while more dangerous, makes the return trip much easier.
Link must then tame the horse by sneaking up on it from behind and mounting it as usual, though the Giant Horse is more warier forcing Link to crouch walk as slowly as possible. Link can increase his sneak ability by wearing clothing and using items granting stealth, to sneaking up behind it more efficiently. Once behind it, Link must them mount it and then soothe it to tame it before his stamina runs out. Due to its size and strength, it can easily drain two circles of stamina, though Link can use Energizing Elixir, Enduring Elixir, or any other items that boost or restore the Stamina Gauge. Link can also sleep at special Inns or eat Akkala Buns at East Akkala Stable to gain an extra yellow stamina wheel. However there are large trees near where its found allowing Link to mount it from the air which is easier than sneaking up behind it as its spooked herd mates may alert it to Link's presence. Link can also utilize a weak bow to fire Shock Arrows to stun it allowing Link to put himself into position to mount it as soon as it recovers. Ice Arrows also work though they take longer to wear off.
Once properly tamed, Link must then ride the horse back to Straia. If Link took out the all enemies, the way will be easier, however the enemies confrontation will be harder as the Giant Horse has zero Spurs and thus lacks the ability to gallop. However it is still possible to get past these enemies, Link can outride them by improving the affinity bond with the Giant Horse, making it obedient to easily escape from the Lynels and mounted Bokoblin. Link can bond with it by riding it around the Taobab Grasslands area, soothing it when it follows his commands or by simply feeding it apples and any carrots. Link can also use the Bokoblin Mask, Lynel Mask, or Majora's Mask to disguise himself though he should avoid lingering around the Lynels as they will eventually see through his disguise. Majora's Mask is ideal as it effects both Bokoblins and Lynels. Another method is to bring some bows and several Ancient Arrows. The Ancient Arrows will instantly obliterate any non-Guardians or non-bosses when hit including Lynels, though they also destroy any materials or equipment drops. However since this method involves combat, Link should rely on slow motion shooting to ensure he hits his targets. The best way to do this is by vaulting off off the Giant Horse while wielding a durable bow however alternatively Link can ride a tamed horse to the grasslands vaulting off it to slow motion shoot Ancient Arrows. Link should be careful to ensure the Blood Moon occurred recently enough to avoid slain enemies being respawned upon the return trip.
After examining it, Straia is convinced that it is a rare breed and that it is strong enough to tramp monsters. He rewards Link with a Silver Rupee and allows Link to do whatever he wants with the Giant Horse afterwards. Link is not required to register the Giant Horse during the Quest though it is a good time to do so. The best place to register it is nearby Highland Stable. Link can register it during the quest even though it effectively removes the Giant Horse from the wild though Straia is unconcerned by this despite it rendering his study redundant as the Giant Horse is the last of its kind though Straia may be unaware of this fact as it is revealed by the Sheikah Slate's Hyrule Compendium entry. It is a good idea to register it first before talking to Straia as it allows Link to keep the Giant Horse which can be revived by Malanya at Malanya Spring if it is slain or dies accidentally."

The Gerudo Secret Club is only open to those who know the password. Link must find someone who knows the password to gain entry.
To get the password, Link must travel across Gerudo Town to The Noble Canteen where he will find Pyra, Sumati, and Yaido chatting on the couches. If spoken to directly, they will yell at Link for eavesdropping on their conversation.
If Link visits the house next door where Gerudo child Pearle lives with her older sister at night and speaks to Pearle, she reveals that one can overhear people talking in the bar next door. If Link stands at the nearby window in Pearle's home, he can listen into Pyra, Sumati, and Yaido to their conversation secretly without getting caught.

If Link inputs the password incorrectly, however, he will have to wait at least one day (in-game time) to try to input the password again.
Imputing the correct password causes the door to open and Greta allows Link to purchase ""voe"" armor at her shop. It is revealed that the password is due to the fact the Gerudo Secret Club is a black market shop that sells ""voe"" clothing as it is illegal for Gerudo merchants in Gerudo Town to sell voe clothing (this apparently does not apply to travelers as Link can sell any sellable armor to merchants in Gerudo Town with no problem), despite the demand for it. After completing this side quest, the door to the Gerudo Secret Club remains unlocked allowing Link to enter at any time.

Reward(s)
Rubber Helm
Thunder Magnet is a side quest in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is a quest given to Link by Cima at the Lakeside Stable. Link will receive a Rubber Helm as a reward for completing the quest.
When Link first talks to Cima, she tells the Champion that every time it rains she becomes unnerved as lightning strikes the stable without fail. Link then takes up her request to figure out why lightning hits the stable so frequently whenever a storm brews. He then climbs on top of the stable, and sees the problem: on the horse's head, there is a Woodcutter's Axe that is lodged into it and the metallic head of the weapon is what draws lightning to the stable.
The hero then takes the axe out of the horse's head and talks to Cima about why the lightning strikes happen so frequently, and in turn, solving the trouble and getting the Rubber Helm as a reward."

— Adventure Log description
EX Teleportation Rumors! is a DLC side quest in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is unlocked upon installation of the DLC Pack ""The Master Trials"". It requests Link to find the Super Rumor Mill V2 book at the South Akkala Stable. The quest guides Link toward a new key item, the Travel Medallion, found in a Treasure Chest which has just appeared at Lomei Labyrinth Island in the Akkala Sea region, near the middle of the southern wall in the vast chamber of the labyrinth containing aging Guardian beneath the Tu Ka'loh Shrine. Link can distinguish the chest containing the Travel Medallion from the others as it is contained inside an EX Treasure Chest which has the ""EX"" in bold letters on the lid. Collecting it completes the side quest.
The Travel Medallion[]
Main article: Travel Medallion
The Travel Medallion is a piece of ancient Sheikah technology that allows Link to create temporary Travel Gates called Travel Points which he can use as Fast Travel points. The Travel Medallion functions similar to Farore's Wind from Ocarina of Time though functions outside of Dungeons. However the Travel Medallion cannot be used in certain locations such as the Trial of the Sword. Link can only create one Travel Point at a time and creating a new one causes the previous one to be disappear.
The Travel Medallion is useful as it allows Link to create Travel Points in specific places that he wishes to return to later without too must backtracking. It can also make reaching specific locations such as Link's House or the Woodcutter's House less time consuming. It is especially useful in areas that currently lack  an active Travel Gate making it especially useful early on in his quest after leaving the Great Plateau."
https://zelda-archive.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mystery_Polluter,"When spoken to, Dalia will express dismay that even though she has been working to make the soil fertile so she can start a garden, someone keeps sending refuse down the irrigation system.
Following the trail of melon rinds back up to their source will lead Link to Calyban, a Gerudo sitting up on the wall beside the water that flows throughout Gerudo Town. She has been eating Hydromelons and throwing the rinds into the water, which is what is polluting Dalia's garden.
Calyban will demand Link bring her ten wildberries in exchange for her ceasing to throw melon rinds down the irrigation system. Upon tasting the wildberries, Calyban realizes she has been selfish and vows to go help Dalia with her garden.
When Link goes to speak to Dalia again, she will tell him that some Gerudo woman she had never met before came to help her clean up the garbage, and even gave her a hydromelon. She will give the hydromelon to him to thank him for helping her resolve the problem. Dalia says the Gerudo woman also gave her some wildberries, so her garden will be a wildberry plot now, and that Link can come and visit whenever he likes. Dalia can be found at night sleeping in her mother's fruit stand tent. You cannot talk to her until morning, when she will run to the patch of dirt she has been trying to cultivate a garden inside of. This patch of dirt is to the right of the tavern."

https://zelda-archive.fandom.com/wiki/EX_Trial_of_the_Sword,"The voice mentions a trial and advises Link to speak with the The Great Deku Tree at Korok Forest to take on the challenge. According to The Great Deku Tree, the Master Sword's power has to be awakened. When Link approaches the pedestal, he requests him to place the sword back in its pedestal and to face the Trial of the Sword, which takes place in the Sword Monks' Shrine.
Similar to what occurs at arriving on Eventide Island for the first time in search of the Shrine during ""Stranded on Eventide"", Link will not be permitted to use any of his weapons, armor, items, or gear that he has collected from outside of the trial and must rely on what he collects inside of the trial for survival. Link is also barred from using the Travel Medallion within the trial and resuming progress from that floor, should Link leave for whatever reason. When Link has gone through all forty five floors, at the end he will come across the ""Sword Monks"" who are seven unnamed Sheikah Monks who will return the Master Sword back to its original splendor.
In order to clear a floor, Link must defeat the enemies of that floor with whatever he has on him at the time so he can teleport to the next floor. If Link departs from the trial before he clears all forty-five floors, he must restart the trial all the way from the first floor. However the trial is separated into three sections and when he completes a section Link can stop and return to take on the others later. The first section is the easiest and once completed the Master Sword's base attack power is increased to 40. The second section is moderately difficult and once completed the Master Sword's base attack power is increased to 50. The third and final section is the hardest and once completed unlocks the Master Sword's ""true"" power state permanently increasing its attack power to 60 and increasing its durability.
Unlocking the ""True"" Master Sword[]
Link wielding the ""True"" Master Sword after completing the trial
Upon completing this trial, Link will find a room with seven Sword Monks who restore the Master Sword's true power. Once Link removes the Master Sword from its pedestal within the room, the Master Sword's ""True"" full powered glowing state will be unlocked permanently, thus allowing Link to use it at all times. The Master Sword's true power state doubles the Master Sword's 30 base attack to 60 and increases its durability.
It does not make the Master Sword truly ""unbreakable"" as it still loses its charge and enters its cool down phase (the duration of which remains the same), though its increased durability allows it to be used more and its allows Link to use its full power at all times, instead only when he's facing corrupted enemies, Scourges of the Divine Beasts, and Ganon himself."

https://zelda-archive.fandom.com/wiki/The_Royal_White_Stallion,"""The white horse on Safula Hill supposedly has a beautiful pure-white coat without any mottling... They say it roams by itself, apart from other groups of horses. If you end up finding it and registering it at a stable, I'd really love to see it. Thanks.""
— Toffa
Toffa tells Link his grandfather's story about a pure white horse. It may be a descendant of the Royal Family's White Horse originally owned by Princess Zelda. It was said to have escaped to Safula Hill after the fall of Hyrule Castle to Calamity Ganon one hundred years ago according to local legend.
The white horse can be found at Safula Hill along the path that leads to the Sanidin Park Ruins. The horse is warier, requiring Link to crouch walk as slowly as possible while approaching it from behind. Link can wear clothing and use items that increase his stealth to make approaching it more easier. Three additional segments to the Stamina Wheel are needed in order to be able to tame this horse, otherwise Link will get throw off while attempting to ride it. Energizing Elixirs and Enduring Elixirs can be used if Link does not have the necessary stamina for it. Shock Arrows and Ice Arrows can stun or freeze it to make mounting it easier, though he should use a weaker strength bow such as a Boko or Wooden Bow to avoid causing too much damage to prevent him from accidentally killing it. Shock Arrows are preferred unless it is raining as Link will have to wait for the horse to thaw before mounting while Shock Arrows wear off much more quickly though rain boosts their damage and effect. Link should avoid mounting it during thunderstorms while wearing metallic equipment that attracts lightning though removing said equipment will allow Link to mount it without worrying about attracting lightning though it still could be kill by a stray lightning bolt or the lightning strikes could spook the horse while trying to sneak up on it. Link can also climb the nearby tree and use the Paraglider to land on its back though if his timing is off the startled horse will rear up knocking Link down with its hooves.
After taming it, Link can ride and bring it back to Toffa at the stable. Toffa will request to register it first before speaking to him, though Link can skip this part by registering it as soon as he returns though Link can register it at any Stable he chooses to though the Outskirt Stable is the closest and easiest to reach as the Tabantha Bridge Stable, Serenne Stable, and Riverside Stable are all pretty far and Link would have to return anyways to speak to Toffa to complete the side quest. After it is registered, Toffa is surprised that his grandfather was not lying and gives Link the Royal Bridle and Saddle. This equipment was inherited by Toffa from his own grandfather, custom fitted for the royal family's white horse, which he will automatically equip to the horse replacing the Stable Bridle and Stable Saddle acquired upon registration. Link however can have Canni or female  stable hands at a couple of other stables to change its bridle and saddle after he becomes fully bonding with the White Horse as it allows its mane and equipment be changed unlike Epona and the Giant Horse. The easiest way to achieve max bond with it is to feed it horse food (Apples, Swift Carrots, or Endura Carrots) until it stops eating. The White Horse is the only special horse that is required to be registered as registering the Giant Horse is optional as ""Hunt for the Giant Horse"" only requires Link to tame it and show it to Straia. The White Horse is the only special horse that can be equipped with the Ancient Bridle and Ancient Saddle with it even being shown in promotional art wearing the Ancient Horse Gear.
Toffa is in awe of the horse and tells Link that the sight of the Princess riding atop her white horse was supposed to be a beauty beyond words. It is implied his grandfather may have acquired the equipment off of Zelda's original horse when it began living on Safula Hill but was apparently unable to tame the Royal White Horse which presumably refused to be tamed by anyone as it was Zelda's personal horse. He states that he has no doubts that it is the grandchild of Zelda's white horse though it is unclear if this is true or if the Zelda's original Horse survived for a century possibly with its life prolonged due to its bond and/or association with Zelda or through intervention of divine entities such as Hylia or Malanya. Alternatively White Horses could be extremely long lived something which Toffa and his grandfather may have been unaware of.
After the quest is completed, Toffa says if he was a little younger, he would ride that White Horse with a gal just like the princess. Ironically, Toffa is unaware Link is Zelda's personal Royal Knight and that Zelda is still alive containing Calamity Ganon in Hyrule Castle though presumably he became aware of this fact after Dark Beast Ganon's defeat as Zelda returned to rebuild her kingdom after a century of keeping Ganon sealed."

— Adventure Log description
Good-Sized Horse is a side quest in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is given to Link by Zyle, who can be found at Gerudo Canyon.
He asks to be brought a horse to replace the one he lost on his travels. It can be one that has already been registered at a stable or unregistered, but either way, the Link will not be able to get the horse back. Only regular horses are accepted, but the Zyle has unique dialogue when refusing a Giant Horse (which is too big), a Stalhorse (which is too scary), or others (any of which are ""not a horse"", including the Lord of the Mountain, Bear, and Deer). He will however accept the rare White Horse, though a new White Horse will appear on Safula Hill which Link can tame though he reacts to the White Horse the same way he does any other horse he accepts. Link doesn't even have to tame the horse as he can steal a tamed wild horse of Bokoblin horse riders which ride fully tamed wild horses. Two Red Bokoblin horse riders can be found hunting Boar on Sahasra Slope near Kakariko Village and can easily be killed with a strong bow allowing Link to take one of their their horses. Alternatively if Link has a registered horse he no longer wishes to keep and wants to free up space, he can take it to Zyle to make a profit.
After accepting the horse Link brings him, Zyle pays Link a Gold Rupee and takes ownership of the horse which if registered becomes registered to Zyle though Link keeps any currently equipped horse equipment.
Zyle uses the horse to reach the Outskirt Stable where Link can find him after the quest is completed. Though Zyle tries to insist he still owns the horse he momentarily slips up and reveals that he sold the horse though stops himself from revealing the whole thing and insists he still owns it indicating he may be running a scam as he apparently sold it for more than he paid Link. This explains why he says that any good-sized horse Link brings him is identical to the Horse he lost even the White Horse which is extremely rare thus it is likely his whole story about losing his horse was a lie and he was simply taking advantage of Link's kindness to acquire a regular good-sized horse he could sell thus explaining why he is so particular as presumably the Giant Horse or Stalhorse would be difficult to sell off and Link might discover Zyle's deception as the Giant Horse is easily recognizeable due to its size and the fact it is the last of its kind thus Link could potentially discover it was sold. While White Horse are uncommon they are by no means rare as a new one appears in the wild if Link sells a White Horse to Zyle (though its possible the White Horse escaped back into the wild though Link must re-tame it for selling it to Zyle). Link however can get even by selling Zyle a horse or Bokoblin tamed horse with poor stats during the quest (Bokoblin tamed ones do not have to be tamed as they can be mounted after their riders are knocked off or killed though they generally have poor stats). Beyond this Link is unable to punish Zyle for his deception (save for harassing him by attacking him though Zyle reacts like most NPCs). However Link can take advantage of Zyle's request to make a decent profit off any registered horse he is willing to part with thus use Zyle to free up stable space.
This quest is the only time Link can sell a horse as Stables take in any registered horses he choses to let go for free."

Riddles of Hyrule is a side quest from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is a quest given to Link by Walton in the Great Hyrule Forest region, specifically on top of the Great Deku Tree. The purpose of this quest is to gather an assortment of ingredients and bring them back one by one to him."
https://zelda-archive.fandom.com/wiki/The_Horseback_Hoodlums,"The Horseback Hoodlums is a side quest in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is given to Link by Perosa, who can be found at Highland Stable."
https://zelda-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Robbie%27s_Research,"After restoring the Sheikah Slate's missing components and corrupted data, Purah mentions that her subordinate Robbie is researching Guardians in the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab located in the former Akkala lighthouse in Deep Akkala. Link can take on the quest at any point after completing ""Locked Mementos"", though it is advisable to do so due to the benefits. As ""From the Ground Up"" side quest also takes place in Akkala (after completing ""Hylian Homeowner""), Link can use the opportunity to take part in both side quests, which open up several services in the Akkala province. However Link can wait till he is better prepared as the journey to Akkala is long and potential dangerous depending on the route Link takes. One of the easiest methods to reach Akkala is to use a Raft and Korok Leaf to travel from Necluda Sea up north to the Akkala Sea as it allows Link to get to Akkala without the threat of Guardians and dangerous land based enemies such as Lynels, Hinox, and Talus as the only sea born enemies are Lizalfos and Water Octoroks. Once Link makes it to Akkala he can go straight to Robbie's lab, though should be careful as a Decayed Guardian is on the road leading to the tech lab. He can activate the Akkala Tower to obtain the province's map, but the Akkala Citadel Ruins leading to it is dangerous due the Guardian Skywatcher patrols and it is advisable to begin the quest first, as Link can obtain weaponry and armor that can make assaulting the citadel's Guardians to reach the tower much easier.
Once Link reaches the lab he finds the Ancient Oven Cherry and book Robbie's Memoirs inside the Tech Lab with no sign of any other inhabitants. Speaking to Cherry will trigger a cutscene where Robbie and his assistant-turned-wife Jerrin appear. Robbie vaguely recognizes Link, but cannot be sure. Jerrin finds Link suspicious and refuses to speak to him further unless he proves to her that he is an acquaintance of Robbie's. If Link speaks to Robbie he will ask if his name is Link, though regardless of Link's answer, Robbie is unable to take him at his word, as he cannot be sure if he is truly the legendary Link or not and asks for proof of Link's identity, presumably due to the possibility that Link may be one of the Yiga Clan in disguise. He asks Link to show him the scars he received as a result of his battles during the Great Calamity 100 years prior. Link must remove any body Armor he is wearing to show Robbie his scars, though he can keep any head or leg armor as Robbie only needs to see the scars on his chest as proof of his identity. After asking if he met Purah and what Link knows of the Great Calamity, Robbie introduces himself and asks Link if he will join forces with him to destroy the Calamity. However Robbie reveals that the Blue Flame that powers his lab and the Ancient Oven Cherry has go out and like Purah requests Link use the Blue Flame from the Ancient Furnace at Tumlea Heights west of the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab. Link can find a torch inside the lab which he can use to carry the flame back, though he must be careful as monsters patrol the region making it more difficult than lighting the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab's furnace. After proving his identity to Robbie, Jerrin becomes more friendly towards Link and will speak to him, allowing Link to learn more about her and Robbie. Several Blue Flame Lanterns can be found that can make relighting his torch easier if it rains or if he has to put the torch away to fight enemies. Once the lab's furnace is lit, Cherry's power is restored. Robbie thanks Link for lighting the furnace and restoring Cherry and gives him 3 Ancient Arrows. Robbie explains that Cherry can convert ancient materials into Ancient Soldier Gear like the Ancient Arrows he just gave him. Robbie explains that he originally planned to free the Guardians from Calamity Ganon's control, but the idea proved to difficult to accomplish and Robbie lacked funding due to the fall of Hyrule, so he focused on developing Anti-Calamity weapons and Ancient Soldier Gear for Link instead and advises against the idea of trying to free the Guardians. In addition to Ancient materials, Robbie requires Link to pay Rupees to forge Ancient Soldier Gear as Robbie can use the funds to continue his research. Lighting the furnace and speaking to Robbie completes the quest, allowing Link to use Cherry to forge Ancient Weaponry and armor using Guardian Parts. Ancient Soldier Gear is ideal for combating and defending against Guardians and gives Link access to one of the only shops in Breath of the Wild that sell weapons and shields. Additionally, lighting the lab's furnace also activates the lab's Travel Gate allowing Link to use it as a fast travel point.
However if Link lights the furnace before speaking to Cherry and causing Robbie and Jerrin to appear, Robbie and Jerrin will appear in the lab and Cherry will activate. Also Link can purchase Ancient Soldier Gear as soon as power to Cherry is restored, thus he can purchase any equipment he wishes from Cherry even before talking to Robbie, thus speaking to Robbie to complete the side quest and obtain the free Ancient Arrow sample Robbie gives him is completely optional and is not required to be completed to use Cherry's services. If Link lights the furnace before speaking to Cherry and talks to Robbie when he appears afterwards, Robbie is convinced that his love restored power to Cherry, before Link reveals he had relit the furnace and thanks him. Robbie also does not require proof of Link's identity if the furnace is lit first as Link's actions by relighting the furnace apparently prove his identity to Robbie, however he must speak to Robbie to prove to Jerrin that he is an acquaintance of Robbie.
The Ancient Oven and Materials[]
Once the power has been restored to Cherry, Link can speak to the modified Guidance Stone to have her forge ancient solider gear in exchange for Guardian Parts and Rupees. Guardian Parts can be obtained by defeating Guardians or searching broken inactive Guardians found throughout Hyrule. Broken Guardians without legs with pools of water under them can be moved with the Cryonis Rune causing them to drop some parts as well. Inactive Guardian remains are plentiful in Akkala and near Fort Hateno in West Necluda as well as the Great Plateau, though Link should be careful as Decayed Guardians tend to hide among the inactive guardians. Rare Ancient Cores and Giant Ancient Cores can be obtained from certain Treasure Chests found in Shrines and Divine Beasts. Once Link has obtained some Ancient Arrows, killing Guardians and obtaining their parts becomes much easier. The traveling merchant Teli who travels through the Necluda region sells Guardian parts. Teli sells rarer parts on rainy days. In addition to parts, forging requires Rupees. With the exception of Ancient Arrows, most ancient soldier gear is pricy costing between 1,000 to 2,000 Rupees in addition to the ancient materials needed to forge it. However Rupees can be earned by mining Ore Deposits for gemstones and selling cooked food dishes, or taking part in certain side quests.
Ancient Soldier gear[]
The Ancient Helm, Ancient Cuirass, and Ancient Greaves are a good investment as they grant Guardian Resist bonus and once upgraded to Level 2 or higher grant the Ancient Proficiency set bonus which increases the power of ""Ancient"" and ""Guardian"" series weapons. Additionally, Link should stock up on Ancient Arrows and consider purchasing an Ancient Shield which can automatically deflect Guardian lasers without a Perfect Guard. He can also purchase an Ancient Bow which increases the damage that Ancient Arrows and other arrow types can inflict as it has a base attack power of 44 and high durability. Other Ancient weapons are powerful and useful for combatting both Guardians and monsters. Ancient weapons, bow, and shield will neither burn nor attract lightning. The Akkala Citadel Ruins is a great place to test this equipment as it allows Link to take out the Guardian Skywatchers (which Ancient Arrows and Ancient Bow are perfect for dispatching) in order to reach the Akkala Tower. In addition to inflicting massive damage to  Guardians, Ancient Arrows will obliterate non-boss enemies instantly, though unlike Guardians, this prevents Link from obtaining monster parts and enemy equipment as both are destroyed along with the monster.
Akkala Ancient Tech Lab shop[]
Link can access the shop once power is restored to Cherry by speaking to her. All items are available for purchase from start and unlike the Fang and Bone Link does not need to complete any Divine Beasts to increase its inventory. In addition to Guardian Parts, Arrows are required materials to create Ancient Arrows.

Dressed_to_Kill,Cyberpunk_2077,"The quest automatically initiates as you approach the Desert Film Set, located at Jeff's Dirt Track to the east-northeast of Rocky Ridge town in the region of the same name in the Badlands. Upon arrival, an Trauma Team Atlus can be seen flying away, leaving behind a scene of carnage: Multiple dead bodies, some wearing the uniforms of the Wraiths, and others, oddly enough, sporting very out-of-place high end clothing, something more likely to be seen on a Media; also present is an admittedly nice-looking Thorton Colby CX410 ""Gran Butte"".
After a little searching, V finds a shard on one of the apparent victims which tells the story: Evidently, the executive of some high-end clothing business got it in his head to do a photoshoot out here, as a way of demonstrating the versatility and comfort of their clothing line and appealing to a more ""rustic"" sense of fashion, with the Butte being the centerpiece as a stand-in for an executive limo or sports car. Such activity attracted the Wraiths, who decided that they'd rather shoot bullets than pictures at the unfortunate models. Said models, however, were savvy enough to bring their own iron for just such an occasion, and a firefight ensued between the two sides. What was left of the photoshoot team fled in the AV, leaving their set, and their prized Thorton Colby, behind for the taking-and better for it to be in V's capable hands than the Raffen Shiv.","Search the area.
Get in the car."
Coin_Operated_Boy,Cyberpunk_2077,"When you go to Brendan's usual location outside Megabuilding H8, you will find an upset Theo Price is standing where his unit used to be. She'll explain that Brendan's owners had him taken away to ""re-evaluate"" his code, dismissing her pleas that he was a true friend and more than a simple S.C.S.M. unit.
At the SoftSys shop in Heywood, you can either bribe or convince (requires Technical Ability) the clerk to receive access to the room where Brendan is receiving a firmware update. Once in the room, Brendan notes he's being updated because he mentioned someone's marital troubles and the person didn't like that very much (you can also see this message on the computer next to him confirming it). With sufficient Technical Ability, you can deduce that Brendan is not a true AI, but instead possessed an exceptional convo-emulating algorithm to facilitate his interactions with visitors. He'll then ask you to tell Theo a message from him and give you one last joke if you wish.
Return to Theo to pass along Brendan's message to conclude the job.","Go to the service point.
Talk to the clerk. [Optional]
Find Brendan.
Talk to Brendan.

The_Distance,Cyberpunk_2077,"The gig can be unlocked by finishing The Beast In Me and waiting several days. V receives a message text from Jim Jarry, the organizer of the street races. After agreeing to his offer, there will be four new gigs on the map, marked with crossed flags. Going to one of the flags, V needs to sit on the marked bench and pay €$ 2,000 as entry fee to join the race.
Locations[]
There are 4 different races and tracks which represent the tracks from the Side Jobs:
The Beast in Me: City Center
The Beast in Me: Badlands
The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo
The Beast in Me: The Big Race",
Bullets,Cyberpunk_2077,"Upon returning to Jinguji some time after a previous visit, Zane welcomes V and asks what he can do for you today. After browsing the shop's selection, suddenly a cyberpsycho enters and kills the store's guards. Zane activates the alarm, and V must defeat the cyberpsycho. Once this is done, talk to the MaxTac officer, Melissa Rory, and then sit on the couch. On the way out, there is an option to talk to the MaxTac lieutenant and discuss her mantis blades and the cyberpsycho attack.","Defeat cyberpsycho.
Talk to the MaxTac officer.
Sit next to Zane."
Shape_of_a_Pony,Cyberpunk_2077,"This quest starts after purchasing the Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet (930) from the Autofixer website for €$74,000.
Santo Domingo Fixer Muamar Reyes will send V a message that his Autofixer service normally delivers the cars, but that somehow the seller vanished into thin air.
After replying to the text, Muamar sends V the coordinates of the vehicle last known location, the abandoned parking lot on the outskirts of Arroyo, Santo Domingo.
Once arrived at the scene, there is no sign of the car. Only the body of a man can be found. As you approach the body, Johnny Silverhand will appear and comment on the appearance of the man, as it appears to be an impersonator by the name of Johnny Silverman.
Inspecting the body for clues, you find a pair of shards on the man, a conversation between him and Muamar Reyes and a set of GPS coordinates, which will be uploaded to your navigation system.
Following the coordinates not far from the body, near a makeshift garage south of the EBM Petrochem Stadium, you find encounter several Wraiths surrounding the car. After neutralizing the Wraiths, you can find the Car Keys on one of them and unlock the vehicle by entering it.
After entering the vehicle, a message can be sent to Muamar Reyes about recovering the vehicle. After sending the message Muamar will deposit half of the original purchase price back to your balance.","Read and reply to the message from Muamar.
Go to the car's last known location.

Text Muamar about recovering the car."
Machine_Gun,Cyberpunk_2077,"After a set amount of time (can be approximately eight in-game days) after Skippy has changed firing modes, he will reveal that he has found data on its previous owner, Regina Jones. The gun will then ask you to return him to her. The mission will be added to you journal even if you decline to follow Skippy's request.
If you ask Regina about Skippy, she will remark that he was stolen, and asks you to set him down so she can run a diagnostics test. After she runs the test, Regina says that either a deeper test is required (if Skippy is set to Stone Cold Killer mode) or she will reset Skippy to his default factory settings and rename him ""Daisy"" (if Skippy is set to Puppy-Loving Pacifist mode).
You can then ask her where she got Skippy (won in a poker game), or whether V is going to be compensated for their trouble. If Skippy was reset, there is also the option to accuse Regina of killing Skippy. She will dismiss the accusation because the gun has no consciousness. After receiving the reward, the quest ends.","Take Skippy to Regina Jones.
Set Skippy down.

Head to the Afterlife where you'll find a man, Dennis, looking for a solo to take on a job, but rather than use a fixer, he wants to cut out the middleman and have you work directly for him.
If you agree, he'll ask you to go find a marked fridge in Kabuki and once you gather the contents inside, contact him for further steps.
Head out there and it should be the fridge in the last shack out on the pier. As you might have guessed though, something is off about this: as soon as you open the fridge a rather fatigued man falls out. Call Dennis but he won't tell you the specifics about the guy, only that you need to get him to a nearby car to take him to Northside, and that Tyger Claws will try to kill him and therefore, you.
Tyger members are going to be patrolling the area and standing at the stairs, so you'll have to take them out carefully as, if your companion is killed, the job will fail. You cannot draw a weapon while carrying the man, but you are safely able to put him down on the ground and then move a certain distance to fight.
Once you get to the car, put him in the trunk, then drive to the location in Northside and talk to Dennis. Shortly after he reveals the man's name, Haruyoshi Nishikata, who you can then talk to and who'll then tell you his story: he's the world's best surgeon but the Tyger Claws' boss died on his operating table and the gang became angry at this, so Dennis helped him flee from Japan to Night City. That said, the gang doesn't know that Haruyoshi actually killed the boss on purpose.
For payment, while you'll get some eddies, make sure to also pick up the Scalpel katana that Dennis notes is your reward and is leaning against the barrels.","Go to the slum on the outskirts of Kabuki.

When V arrives in the area, they will hear the sounds of partying nearby. As they approach the nearby rooftops, they encounter multiple 6th Street gang members and their leader, Captain Sherman, sitting on a couch with Walker standing next to him.
If V draws their weapon, the job will end and all of the surrounding 6th Street gangers will turn hostile. As long as one remains polite, the captain will speak up and suppress any hostilities, allowing V to stay and participate.
One can then ask if they're doing a ""lead-spitting"" competition and he'll confirm they are and will allow V to enter if they wish, just a few rules:
You have to take a shot of alcohol before each round
You have to use the revolver on the table near the captain for the shots to count
Do not cross the yellow marquee line at each station, otherwise you will be disqualified
Take the revolver from the table, then head to the first station to begin. Note the player won't be able to save manually during these 4 stations, but can load auto saves if needed. The revolver holds 6 shots and the stations are timed. One can also allow the effects of alcohol to wear off between each station to avoid stacking penalties.
To win the prize, V needs to earn at least 44 points (of a maximum 46 possible) to beat Walker.
If V beats Walker, the captain will be impressed and offer membership into 6th Street, which will be rejected. He will warn V that any encounter in the future will likely be hostile. V can then collect their reward, Divided We Stand. V also has the option to insult Sherman, which results in the gang attacking V.
If Gig: Life's Work was completed prior to this job:
A gang member at the first station will make a remark about knowing V from somewhere. After finishing all stations, he will recognize you, causing the others to become hostile, in which case there's no way to end this quest without a fight breaking out. You can collect Divided We Stand after the fight.","See what's going on.

During the last rambling where Garry is talking about nomads, two Aldecaldos approach and take issue with Garry calling them werewolves.
If V is a Nomad or completed Queen of the Highway prior to the final rambling, and chooses to acknowledge the Aldecados as allies:
V gets them to walk away without any fighting.
If V is not a Nomad or has not completed Queen of the Highway prior to the final rambling, or chooses not to acknowledge them as allies:

Once done, Garry tells V about having heard that a mysterious meeting would take place somewhere in Kabuki.

If V prevents the corpos from leaving:
V obtains the Mysterious Chip off of Jane Doe's corpse, and returns to Garry the Prophet.[N 4] However, once V gets to his usual spot, Garry is nowhere to be found, replaced by his disciple who informs V he was taken away.[N 5]
If V donated enough to Garry earlier:
V can ask them about the chip and they will tell you what they know.

The_Highwayman,Cyberpunk_2077,"To begin this side job, first, head over to Woodhaven Street in Rancho Coronado East and travel up the street to the Gun-O-Rama gun shop. Around the back you'll find an accessible garage with a decal of a ghost horse to the left of it.
Alternatively, the quest can be started by finding Josie's body and reading the shard, ""Bad news"". In this case, the first objective will be to find the garage.
Once inside, V and Johnny will comment on the scrapped Brennan found inside. To officially start the side job, access the terminal on the opposite side of the garage. After reading the data stored, exit the terminal and V will pick up the photo of James Ito and Josie Alcazar resting next to it. This prompts V and Johnny to look for James to find out more about their situation.
To find James, travel to Japantown West and head south along the waterfront four lane road. There will be a plaza on the east side of the road after Holly Street with a 24/7 stand. James is sitting on the same bench in the photo, in front of the 24/7 stand. Talking to him will begin your investigation into what happened to Josie.
James and Josie's bench in front of the 24/7 stand
To find out what happened to Josie, head to Metro: Ebunike on the map. From the metro, with your scanner active, you will pick up a dried blood splatter on the ground. Following the blood splatters, past the Drop Point, on your right is an alleyway; and behind a dumpster, Josie's body.
There will be a shard labelled ""Bad news"" which details Josie's cause of death as well as information on the location of the bike she stole from a Tyger Claw boss. After having an exchange with Johnny, it's time to return to James in Japantown and confront him about what you've discovered. What happens to James after confronting him is up to you. After the confrontation, you will need to find the Tyger Claw boss's bike in order to complete the job.
The shard found on Josie's body mentions it being stowed on Maelstrom turf by All Foods. This will send you to the All Foods Factory in the Northside of Watson. Across street from the travel point, you'll see the ""ghost horse"" that Josie also mentioned in the shard. The bike is in the nearby garage. Punch in the date that James and Josie met (0214) into the keypad next to the garage and it will open.

After helping the Aldecaldos seize the Militech Basilisk, look around the camp to find Bob checking in on an injured Nomad's condition to learn it's not looking good: Jake Scooter needs a special kidney implant for sickle cell anemia. He'll eventually point V to a pickup location Dakota Smith fixed up to get it, a hospital in Little China.[N 1]
Once near the hospital, head to the back cargo area. There an employee will be waiting with the implant. As soon as you pick it up, he runs off as police suddenly charge in and attack you. You have to defeat them all rather than run away to continue the quest. Once they're all dead, confront the employee who'll reveal the police learned of the deal and stepped in to eliminate you, as they believed Dakota was helping out Raffen Shiv and couldn't tell the difference between them and nomads.
After passing an Intelligence attribute check, V asks if anyone else touched the implant and he'll reveal the police put a virus on the firmware as he hands you the original, and that you'll need to swap the unaffected one to remove the virus. You can then decide to let him go or kill him. If V doesn't qualify for the Intelligence attribute check and lets the contact go, then the contact will call out to V as they're leaving. The contact explains that the NCPD put malware on the kidney, and offers V a shard to remove the malware.
Once done, head back to the camp to give Bob the implant.[N 2]
If V gave Bob the kidney while knowing about the malware:[N 3]
V receives a text message from Bob, asking them to return to the camp. It is revealed that Jake's body accepted the organ, and is recovering steadily from the transplant. Bob will thank V for a job well done and for helping Jake.[N 4]

A short time after completing Search and Destroy, V receives a text message from an unknown caller seeking their help. They are told to meet at the No-Tell Motel.
Inside the motel room, V finds a woman in shining chrome with her back to them. Once she starts talking, V learns that she is Lizzy Wizzy, the renowned celebrity musician. She'll eventually reveal that she suspects that her manager and new boyfriend, Liam Northom, is cheating on her. Given her privacy concerns and highly public profile, she wants V to discreetly investigate the matter at the Riot nightclub, which Liam frequents.
V can only enter the club after 8pm. There are several different ways to enter:
The front door, guarded by a bouncer (requires Body to intimidate the bouncer or sufficient Street Cred).
The fire escape in the alley to the left of the building. Ladder can be lowered by hitting or shooting it.
The door to the security room just inside the garage on the right side of the building (requires Intelligence to hack the keypad). An employee badge can also be found on the desk with the computer.
The garage door, to the right of the security room door inside the garage (requires Body to lift the metal shutters).
V does not need to find Liam, but instead find a computer with surveillance feed. To do so, if V acquires the employee badge, go to the door opposite the male bartender and follow the marker to the elevator and head down to street level. The computer can also be reached directly by hacking the door to the security room from the exterior garage (see above). Use the computer and access the surveillance cameras to find Liam talking with a woman in the VIP lounge. V quickly learns it is actually not a romantic affair: Liam is with an Arasaka employee, discussing about making a backup of Lizzy. After listening to the full conversation, Johnny Silverhand appears briefly, where he suggests acquiring the video footage as proof. Interact with the computer again to obtain the video footage. After this, V can call Lizzy to complete the mission, or optionally confront Liam. Note that V cannot confront Liam after calling Lizzy.
Liam can be found in the VIP lounge on the third floor. The male bartender on the second floor can be convinced to reveal his location with either a bribe or a threat (requires Body). V can access the VIP lounge from a second elevator in the security room aforementioned.
If V decides to confront Liam, he will demand to know why they are there:
V claims they went to the wrong room:
Liam demands that V leaves. If V takes too long, the security guards will become hostile, and V will not be able to interact with Liam again.
V threatens to expose Liam's misdeeds:
V can extort Liam for a very substantial payout (30,000 €$) in exchange for the promise of not telling anyone what he is up to. Even if V promised Liam that they wouldn't tell their employer what happened, V can still tell Lizzy the truth.
Upon calling Lizzy, V can lie or tell the truth.
Tell Lizzy it was just an affair:
This ends the job. Lizzy is somewhat satisfied with V's work, even though they don't have proof of the affair. Within an hour or so, Lizzy will send a 1,900 €$ payment as thanks. Part 2 will not trigger if V tells Lizzy that Liam was having an affair, even if they downloaded the security footage.
Tell Lizzy about the secret plot:
This temporarily ends the job. Lizzy is distraught and abruptly hangs up. Within an hour or two, Lizzy sends a 2,800 €$ payment as thanks. If V overheard Liam's conversation and captured the security footage, Part 2 of this job will trigger within a few days.
Part 2[]
If V has told Lizzy the truth, she will call them several days later and ask to meet again at the No-Tell Motel. When V returns, they see that Liam is lying dead on the floor, with Lizzy standing over him. She explains that she pushed him and without realizing the strength of her chrome arms. If V scans Liam, they can note to Lizzy that she strangled him. After some dialogue, she will panic briefly about the possibility of the media finding out before considering her audience's titillating reaction. Eventually, she will ask V to dispose of the body.
Refuse to dispose of Liam's body:
V refuses, telling Lizzy that something isn't right. Lizzy says, ""On the contrary, everything is falling into place. Go, V. And shut the door.""
Agree to dispose of Liam's body:
V says they'll take care of the body and tell Lizzy to sleep soundly. Lizzy responds that she doesn't need to sleep, then thanks Liam's body for a beautiful gift. V asks what she's talking about, but Lizzy dismisses V, telling them to go and take the body and dispose of it.
Afterwards, Lizzy will send eddies and a messaging of thanks. A few days later, Lizzy will send another message saying that their ""adventure"" was very inspirational and she put out her new BD thanks to V.","Meet with the mysterious client at No-Tell Motel.

Some time after meeting with Alt Cunningham and dealing with the Voodoo Boys, V is contacted by Frank Nostra, a former colleague of them who also worked at the Arasaka Corporation's Counter Intelligence Division, who has recorded a message for them.
In the recorded message, Nostra tells V that Susan Abernathy, the director of Arasaka's North American Special Operations division, is purging the department of anybody who is not one-hundred percent on her side, and that he himself is one of the people that appeared on her radar. Not intending to wait around until the proverbial executioner would come around, he informs V that he started to put together a file on Abernathy, and that he has hidden the documents in question in a safe location. The message ends with Nostra informing V that the reason they are receiving the message is because Nostra himself was unable to make use of the documents, and expects that V will know how to handle the situation, and that they can find the documents at the attached coordinates.[N 1]
The attached coordinates lead V to a dumpster in an alley on Allen street in the Kabuki sub-district of Watson. When V approaches the dumpster, Johnny Silverhand projects himself in front of them and starts mocking V about their continued interest in the Corporate lifestyle.
If V decides to interact with Johnny:
V tells Johnny that they've still got a few scores to settle, to which Johnny will respond that he knew all along they were still into the Corporate ""rat race,"" after which V mocks Johnny for not having something more important to do.
After V moves the dumpster, they find the mentioned briefcase, which upon opening appears to be empty. V is then confronted by a disheveled and bitter, but still very much alive Frank Nostra, who currently finds himself in a similar situation that V found themselves not too long ago. In his desperation to prove Abernathy wrong, Nostra is convinced that turning over V to her will get him back into her good graces and employed at Arasaka again.
If V tells Frank that they're a nobody to Abernathy [Combat]:
V tells Nostra that Abernathy probably doesn't even know that they exist or that she even ever knew of their existence, and explains to Nostra that they were just a tool used by Arthur Jenkins in an attempt to get rid of Abernathy. V also tells Nostra that if they were both to return to the Arasaka headquarters, they would probably both be shot at on sight. Nostra replies with that he has nothing to lose, and engages combat with V.
If V tells Frank that they're pathetic:
V tells Nostra the story about another former colleague of theirs, Joey Livani, who pissed himself the day he got fired, and that they saw him as the most pathetic guy to have ever worked at Arasaka. However, V informs Nostra that they have now taken over the title of most pathetic Arasaka employee.
If V tells Frank to open his eyes [Non-Combat]:
V mocks Nostra for being a fool and trying to get back into Arasaka after they fired him without any mercy. They tell him that his time at Arasaka should be considered complete and that they should try and refigure out their life, and that Nostra has the means start a new career path in Night City if he properly uses the tools—a gun, ammunition and a little initiative—at his disposal.[N 2]

Not intending on being taken in by Nostra, V puts up a fight, resulting in Nostra's neutralization. Upon inspecting his body, V is able to snag his Iconic JKE-X2 Kenshin, the Apparition.

After dealing with the gangoons, either by convincing them to back off or engaging in combat with them, the corpo will pay you for defending him before passing out again.

If you scared them off, the diner owner will be happy, saying the drinks are free. If you don't make either the Body or Streetkid Lifepath dialogue choices and end up killing the 3 gangers, the owner will demand you leave the place for taking lives just to save a few eddies.
If you got into a fight but didn't kill the gangers (e.g. using lethal weapons or lethal quickhacks), the diner owner will be glad and say that the drinks are on the house (just like if you had made the Body or Streetkid Lifepath dialogue choices).",Talk to the diner owner.

Gun_Music,Cyberpunk_2077,"Shortly after V and Panam Palmer rescued Saul Bright from the Wraiths Camp, the other Aldecaldos—Cassidy, Carol, and Teddy—went into Night City to deliver cyberware to a group of Scavengers.
Upon approaching the location at an industrial complex on Martin Luther King Boulevard and Valley street in Arroyo, Santo Domingo, V is stopped by Aldecaldo Taco and informed about the situation.
Intent on helping the Aldecaldos, V goes to see what is going on and interrupts the conversation between the Aldecaldos and the leader of the Scavengers, who is complaining that the delivery of cyberware was three days later than intended. The Aldecaldos reason that this was due to the dust storm that passed a few days ago.
As V talks with them, the Scavenger leader will agree to a percentage cut, but realizes that V participated in shooting up the Scavenger Den. With sufficient Body, you can intimidate the scavengers to resolve the deal peacefully and pay the Aldecaldos. Otherwise a gunfight will break out; Carol will be displeased by this outcome.
If V has high a enough Body attribute:
V was able to intimidate the Scavengers and have them make the deal with the Aldecaldos. The Aldecaldos thank V for their help before returning to the Mobile Camp.
If V started a fight:
A gunfight broke out during the conversation, causing the Scavengers to engage V and the Aldecaldos. After the gunfight, Carol will be angry with V, but Cassidiy will reason with her. The Aldecaldos thank V for helping before returning to the Mobile Camp.","See what's going on.
If a gunfight breaks out:
Neutralize the Scavengers.
Talk to Carol.
If V is able to intimidate the Scavengers:

Help the nomads negotiate a deal.
Talk to Carol.
Notes[]
If V is male and initiated this side job before Queen of the Highway, Cassidy will write him a text message concerning Panam some time after completing the job.[1]
V can covertly kill the entire Scavenger team except Roman before the negotiation dialogue has even ended. The leader will act as if they are still alive.
Taco and his twin brother Jeff can be approached at the Mobile Camp after this job, where they will both thank V for their help.
If With a Little Help from My Friends is started while Gun Music is available but not yet started, Gun Music will temporarily disappear until the former is completed.

Space_Oddity,Cyberpunk_2077,"In the south side of Santo Domingo, you will come across a group of homeless men crowded around a corpo briefcase, unable to open it. You can convince them to hand it over before they get hurt, either by threatening them (requires Body) or paying them off.
Once the briefcase is V's, you will be tasked to find the body of its former owner, who can be found by following a scannable blood trail to the nearby dumpsters. From the corpse of the hapless corpo, you will retrieve an access card that can be used to open the locked briefcase. Alternatively, you can hack it open (requires Intelligence). Either way, open the file launch.exe on the computer; this will send a signal triggering something to drop from orbit. You will be directed to a new objective about two kilometers to the south, in the Badlands.
Go to the new marker, but be wary of a Militech response team that was also dispatched to the area. All seven soldiers will need to be taken out before the pod can be accessed. Once done, open the pod, and Johnny will comment it is a valuable painting, likely from a wealthy highrider on the moon.
Once looted, the Untitled 18 – Brancesi, 2021 will be on display in V's Apartment.","Talk to the bums.

When you reach the auto shop, you will see several Valentinos Thugs there, making the location far from clear. After taking out the thugs, go to the delivery van and open its back doors. In the back you'll find no experimental Militech cyberware, and only a fake SEMURAI jacket.
While making your way back to Kirk and Big Joe, you hear gunshots in the distance. Arriving at the meeting point, you'll encounter a Valentino by the name of Thomas Hays and two of his thugs.

V comes across a street musician playing on a guitar, and Johnny Silverhand will ask if V likes his music. After a brief exchange, Johnny will note that bootlegs of Samurai concerts might still exist. He'll then note that an old club they used to play at, Rainbow Cadenza, is nearby, if they want to check for those bootlegs.
V heads over only to find it is now a food joint, which Johnny will remark on. V head inside and speaks to the staff, who points V to an old vendor nearby who keeps bugging them about the old club. The vendor, Karim Noel, located at a stall nearby, and he'll talk a lot about Samurai and Johnny before V is able ask him about the bootlegs. You'll have to convince him that you're a true Samurai fan before he would even entertain the idea of selling the records to you.
Karim will quiz you. When you call on Johnny for assistance, he'll give you an answer, but when you tell the vendor, it's actually wrong. You can then ask Johnny for the correct one and he'll give it. This time Karim will be impressed and will give you the bootleg for free.
Once V has the SAMURAI Concert Recording, Johnny will discuss the vendor, noting Karim may be a big fan and knows all his lyrics, but never took the time to understand that Johnny was calling for change, and instead Karim remains stuck in the 2020s.

After completing Ghost Town and reaching 40 Street Cred, an undiscovered quest will appear some time after on your map, in the same tunnels where Nash's Raffen Shiv hideout was. The quest starts automatically once you visit the location, where you come across an odd sight: among the darkness and crags of the unfinished tunnel, in an old shipping container, is a jet black Rayfield Caliburn ""Murkmobile"", along with several containers and amenities that imply someone set up shop here or at least intended to do so. A quick search in a nearby container reveals the story. A young man, orphaned by the murder of his parents, resolved himself to become a vigilante, a creature of the night dedicated to fighting the darkness of the city from within the darkness: Murk Man. Unfortunately, Murk Man seems to have abandoned his hideout or, possibly, was killed by the very criminals he had hoped to fight. Still, every vigilante needs a nice ride--hence the Caliburn. And if Murk Man isn't around to make good use of it, you may as well in his stead.","Search the container.

Arriving at the spot—a collapsed bridge that borders the ravine of the northern Badlands—Mitch reveals that Scorpion's body is in the trunk of the car. V, freaked out by this, asks what Mitch is doing, who responds that Scorpion's final wish was to ""sent off with a bang.""
Mitch instructs V to grab a nearby gas canister filled with CHOOH2 and place it in the passenger seat of the car, as Mitch places Scorpion's body in the driver's seat. After that, Mitch asks V to light the rag he put in the car's gas tank on fire, while he starts the car remotely.
V and Mitch watch on as the car rides off the ramp into the ravine and explodes. Mitch explains to V that it felt right to include them as they are still alive because of them, and gives them Scorpion's Stinger and his beloved good luck charm, an Action Figure, as thanks.[N 3]","Talk to Mitch.

Upon approaching the Afterlife after being directed by Rogue to talk to Panam during Ghost Town or completing KOLD MIRAGE, Netrunner Nix messages V and asks them to stop by the Afterlife to discuss a job, which involves purchasing a rare ""The Book of Spells"" from the netrunner R3n0. As simple as the errand appears to be, Nix wants V to buy The Book of Spells in his stead just in case the exchange unexpectedly goes wrong, and he intends to compensate V for both the expense and the pickup. Nix sends R3n0's contact into to V. Call her to set up a meeting.
Travel to the restaurant Au Cabanon in Charter Hill, next to the Lele Park fast travel point. R3n0 is waiting by the bar with a laptop. At this point, V has two ways to get The Book of Spells. The first way is to speak with R3n0 and buy The Book of Spells for 5500 eurodollars, which concludes the deal without violence despite V's misgivings that R3n0 is a scammer. The second way is to avoid paying R3n0 at all by attacking her (scanning her laptop will also immediately turn her hostile), then jacking into her laptop after she is unconscious or dead. The Book of Spells's coordinates are in the laptop's messages, which also reveal how R3n0 came into possession of The Book of Spells: she is an employee of Hard Wire Ltd. named Clarity, and her boss asked her to review the data on an old cyberdeck that had been found in storage in one of their warehouses. Clarity could not get past The Book of Spells's malware, but recognized its value to a more skilled netrunner and decided to sell it without her boss's knowledge.
V is then directed to a shopping plaza across the street. Open the suitcase, tucked away next to a vending machine, to reveal The Book of Spells: a genuine Zetatech XPR tablet. Johnny Silverhand will comment that it was cutting edge tech back in 2020 and he used to own one. Take The Book of Spells. V can optionally crack The Book of Spells themselves before returning to Nix, which can potentially reward cash and some quickhacks.
Return to Nix to hand over The Book of Spells and receive payment. If V has high enough Intelligence, they can point out that The Book of Spells is worth much more than Nix is paying, and he will reluctantly give V a bonus.
Alternatively, V may access the ""Smuggler's Cache"" netpage after receiving Nix's message to see R3n0's post, which will change the objective to call R3n0. V will no longer be able to ask Nix what gig he is offering, and Nix will pretend he is not very interested in The Book of Spells and will not offer to compensate V for the price of purchasing it. But V will now have access to two Cool dialogue options to make Nix pay double or triple his original price. If V does not bargain with Nix, he will pay the same as if he had offered V the gig directly, but if he pays double he will offer 37.5% more and 75% more if he pays triple. V will still have access to the Intelligence option to point out The Book of Spells is worth more, in which case the cool dialogue options cannot be used.[verification needed]","Talk to Nix.

V can intervene by speaking with Officer Aldwyn. V can choose to demand that the officers leave the man alone, which turns them hostile, or turn a blind eye and walk away.
If V has a Streetkid background, they have an additional dialogue option to learn more about the beaten man's circumstances. The man, Nigel Hamilton, is a wealthy corpo who showed an XBD to a girl that put her into a coma. That woman happened to be the daughter of one of Aldwyn's friends, and Aldwyn was taking justice into his own hands since Hamilton's status meant he was going to avoid being charged with a crime. V can then persuade the officers to leave peacefully by volunteering to deal with Hamilton for them.
However the officers are handled, V must then wake and confront Hamilton, leaving the area at this point causes the job to fail. In addition to immediately letting Hamilton go, V can also dig deeper or force him to pay for the help.
If V has 5 Cool: V can demand payment. Hamilton hands over €$2280. V then has two more options, either of which will conclude the side job:

To receive this job, V must have resolved amicably the dispute between Kerry Eurodyne and Us Cracks during I Don't Wanna Hear It and completed Off the Leash.
Some time after completing the prerequisite jobs, V will receive a call from Blue Moon, who asks them to help her dealing with a stalker that has sent death threats. If asked, the only clue she can provide is that he signs his letters ""GC"". Her plan is to go for a stroll around Kabuki Roundabout to lure the stalker out so V can catch him in the act. Then she wants V to teach him a lesson without killing him, because that would be bad for Us Cracks' image. V agrees to the plan and meets Blue Moon at Kabuki Roundabout. She will walk through part of the lower level of the roundabout, turn into an alley to the market and then go up to the footbridge.
Right after starting the operation, V notices a suspicious person on the upper level who starts taking photos of Blue Moon. Confronting him will complete the optional objective ""Make sure the stalker isn't lurking on any level of Kabuki Roundabout."". When questioned, he will say he is taking pictures of Blue Moon to sell them. If asked whether he has noticed anything out of the ordinary, he will point out a girl in green who is in every single photo he has taken.
Scanning her reveals that her name is Griselda Martinez. She has a brown ponytail, a green tank top and a pink rabbit backpack. She can be first seen leaning against a wall while Blue Moon is talking to V, then starts following at street level with her head turned towards Blue Moon, who is on the lower level. She will lean against the railing while Blue Moon is confronted by a group of 5 Animals who think they recognize her. After passing them, Blue Moon will stop to browse a magazine display. At this point Griselda will approach her, asking to take a picture together and saying her name is Green Cloud.
If V has been told the stalker's letters were signed GC, they can confront Griselda about her nickname and how she signs her letters, making her hostile. Otherwise, she can still be questioned, but, without any proof, she will just walk away. If followed, she will go to the nearby Weapon Vendor and, if asked what is she doing in a gun shop, she becomes nervous and attacks V.
Alternatively, V can keep following Blue Moon until she reaches the middle of the footbridge, where Green Cloud reappears in front of her, pulling a gun and starting to rant. V should quickly incapacitate Green Cloud before she shoots and kills Blue Moon, failing the job.
In any case, after neutralizing Green Cloud, V can search her body to find a Disturbing Diary and a Marred Still of Blue Moon, a picture with the eyes cut out.
With the stalker revealed and unconscious, Blue Moon asks V what to do. They can either tell her to let the NCPD handle things, or simply kill the stalker. If Green Cloud is killed, Blue Moon will be briefly dismayed. V will justify themselves by saying that stalking is not punished with lifetime imprisonment, and they would have eventually attacked Blue Moon again. If V tells Blue Moon to let the police handle it, she will be worried about the stalker attacking again, with V telling her to simply give them another call in such an event. There are no consequences for either option. Blue Moon leaves and will send V payment soon after.","Go to the meeting spot and wait for Blue Moon.

Beat_on_the_Brat,Cyberpunk_2077,"Preliminaries[]
After the initial fight with the training robot, it acts as a tracker for the following side jobs:
Beat on the Brat: Arroyo
Beat on the Brat: Kabuki
Beat on the Brat: Rancho Coronado
Beat on the Brat: The Glen
Only the Kabuki fight can be done during Act 1, as the rest of the locations are inaccessible until Act 2 due to Watson being under NCPD lockdown. Completing all four fights will unlock the championship fight against professional boxer Razor Hugh. To unlock this final fight, you must first complete Transmission.
If V has completed the side job Send in the Clowns—which unlocks after completing the main job Transmission—an optional fifth preliminary fight will be unlocked:
Beat on the Brat: Pacifica
Razor Hugh[]
The championship fight against Razor Hugh is held in the Grand Imperial Mall in Pacifica. The fight starts at 12:01 AM, and if V arrives before that time, they'll be prompted to skip the time on a nearby bench. Before the fight begins, Coach Fred will offer to double V's cash reward if they throw the fight and let Razor win. V can accept, ensuring they will receive the bonus no matter how they lose. If V wins the fight, then regardless of whether they took Fred's offer, they will still receive the standard amount of money as a reward.
Close to where Coach Fred privately speaks to V there is also a child that wants to talk to V. She will mention how her father fought Razor years ago, fell in the third round and despite the referee calling the match, Razor kept attacking, badly injuring him in the process. She says she wants Razor to pay for ruining her family's life.
Among the audience there are all of V's past opponents — Esquerdo & Certo, César Diego Ruiz, Rhino — and Viktor Vektor, who will tell V that Razor is weak to hits in the torso because he recently had new abdominal muscles implanted. Punching Razor in the gut will stagger him for a few seconds. Razor is fast and hits hard but can be stun-locked by repeatedly breaking his guard with charged punches using Gorilla Arms. He also badly telegraphs his moves; a well-timed guard will turn into a counter with a brief couple of seconds of slowed-down time, letting V get several key punches into his gut.
If V accepted to throw the fight and lost:
Coach Fred rewards V with the standard €$50,000 and an extra €$20,000. Viktor will notice this and criticize V for it.
If V accepted to throw the fight and won:
Fred will be angry, but they will still reward the merc with €$50,000. Viktor and the other fighters will compliment V for winning the fight.
If V didn't accept to throw the fight and lost:
Fred is happy that V has changed their mind, offering €$50,000 plus an extra that V can either accept or decline. If accepting, Viktor will notice this and criticize V for it.
If V didn't accept to throw the fight and won:
Coach Fred will reward the standard €$50,000. Viktor and the other fighters will compliment V for winning the fight.
If V talked to the child and won the fight:
As V is leaving the venue, V will overhear the girl having a phone conversation with someone where it appears she lied about her family's situation in order to motivate V to win the fight so she can win more money betting on Razor losing. When confronted, the child will run away.
If V talked to the child and lost the fight:
She will ignore V.","This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝

KOLD_MIRAGE,Cyberpunk_2077,"If V reads the shard ""Notice of Expiration"" in Act II:
V learns about the the job by reading the Notice of Expiration shard.
If V has completed Spellbound:
Some time after completing Spellbound, Nix will text V stating he has decrypted the spellbook, and provides coordinates to a location deep in the Municipal Landfill, down the road past Medeski Fuel Station. Alternatively, the quest may be started by simply coming to this location sometime after completing Ghost Town.
The coordinates lead to an old freezer. Open it to find the corpse of Rache Bartmoss, and, after a short dialogue with Johnny Silverhand, scan the freezer and pick up Bartmoss' Cyberdeck.
Head to the Afterlife and show the deck to Nix, who will tell you that Bartmoss was likely killed by NetWatch. He will offer to decrypt the data on the deck, either now or at a later time.
Although he encounters little resistance when he begins accessing the deck, Nix soon trips a hidden piece of malware, and his cyberware begins to malfunction. Johnny reappears, recognizing the malware as a ""brain broiler"" and urging V to do something fast. There are two possible ways to save Nix. You can either override the power panel on the wall next to the door or jack into the computer next to Nix's desk to breach the cyberdeck yourself. The latter option will allow Nix full access to the deck's data, and out of gratitude for saving his life he will reward V with five quickhacks he found: Memory Wipe, Reboot Optics, Short Circuit, Sonic Shock, and System Collapse.","See where the coordinates lead.

Beat_on_the_Brat:_The_Glen,Cyberpunk_2077,"The opponent here is César Diego Ruiz, a member of the Valentinos and boxing champion of the Glen. He has a girlfriend, Micaela, with a baby on the way. In lieu of betting money, Ruiz will stake his ride, the Villefort Alvarado ""Vato"". In turn, you'll need to stake €$20,000.
This match may seem difficult at first, especially if challenging him at a lower level. Ruiz has a large health pool, and his signature attack can knock you out in as few as two hits. Fortunately, his signature attack has an extremely obvious tell. Back away from him a good distance, making sure to leave ample room to move on the right. Ruiz will put up his fists and step with a blur effect towards you before jumping and throwing a punch. Simply circle to the right of him when he begins to blur or before he jumps and his attack will be completely avoided, leaving him wide open for a few seconds. Punch Ruiz's head a few times before he turns around, then back off and wait for your stamina to recover. Rinse and repeat until he goes down.
You can also cheat a bit to give you a slight advantage by littering recovery items and non-lethal melee weapons on the court and pick them up during the fight to get around the block usually in place on these items during matches. Furthermore, recovery implants and the Gorilla Arms implant can be freely used if you have them installed.
When Ruiz is defeated, he will concede the money and car as promised, but you have a few options:
Take both the car and the money
Take the car, but leave Ruiz the money
Take the money, but leave Ruiz the car
Decline both the money and car
The options only affect your final reward and the discussion Ruiz and Micaela have afterwards. As long as you didn't take both the car and money, Ruiz and Micaela have the same reaction.","Go to the fight in the Glen.
Talk to the champion of the Glen.
Defeat César.
Talk to the champion of the Glen."
Beat_on_the_Brat:_Pacifica,Cyberpunk_2077,"This one requires you to complete the main job Transmission first to then open up the side job Send in the Clowns which needs to be completed for this. As such, you can actually end up doing the championship fight in Beat on the Brat with Razor Hugh before you get this one based on how you completed other quests.
You'll be fighting in the large, dry pool area, so you'll have plenty of room to evade. That said, your major concern is Ozob's nose: it is a live grenade so if you hit it wrong too many times, you could set it off.
Ozob's grenade nose will detonate after accumulating about 75% of his health in damage to his head. This instantly kills Ozob and V wins by ""technical knockout"" and must talk to the referee standing on the side of the pool to get the reward money and complete the quest.","Go to the fight in Pacifica.

Venus_in_Furs,Cyberpunk_2077,"Some time after meeting Takemura, Meredith will message V to let them know that everything has worked out following the raid on the All Foods Factory. V then sends a flirtatious reply to Meredith, after which she tells V to meet her at the No-Tell Motel in Kabuki, Watson.
Upon reaching the room at the hotel, V'll be greeted by a provocatively dressed Meredith, who comments that they probably didn't expect to see her there. V will ask what happens next, and a cutscene of the two having a romantic scene will play out. Afterwards, Meredith will bid V farewell, leaving behind a reward, and sending a text message.[N 1]","Go to the First floor of the No-Tell Motel.

Sacrum_Profanum,Cyberpunk_2077,"At Cargo Bay, V can encounter a monk who is fully cybered up and in serious distress because of it. After speaking with him, V discovers that he and his brother were taken captive by Maelstrom and he was forcibly installed with Cyberware, which is against the religion that the monks follow. Maelstrom let him go, but his brother is still in captivity.
The monk asks V for help and directs them to a nearby Abandoned Warehouse surrounded by shipping containers. There are several Maelstrom goons that need to be taken out, but the monk wishes for V to avoid killing them.
When you arrive at the warehouse, you spot several possible ways of entry;
A grate on the south side of the building that can be opened with Technical Ability 7.
Climbing the containers at either the northwest or southeast side of the building to sneak past the enemies.
By simply walking inside through the front gate (this method will instantly alert the enemies).
Once inside, neutralize the enemies and approach the monk to speak with and set him free. Note that the monk is a neutral NPC, so he can die if not careful. To the left of the monk there is an Iconic M221 Saratoga called Fenrir.

Once all of them have been completed, Regina will call V to have a meeting in person, with her comments based on if you had managed to keep them all alive or not before she gives you your reward. If none are killed, she is very grateful, as she is helping them get therapy to further understand their condition. The reward is given even if some of the cyberpsychos are killed instead of incapacitated.

Shoot_To_Thrill,Cyberpunk_2077,"You get a call from Robert Wilson, the owner of the local 2nd Amendment in your megabuilding. He is hosting a shooting competition to drum up some local business. You arrive with five other competitors, although one is kicked out after breaking Wilson's pistol only rule.
Once the competition starts, your objective is simple. Hit as many targets as many times you are able to within the time limit. So it is advised to use a pistol that has a high-rate of fire and a large magazine. You are not restricted to the target in your lane, so make advantage of the fact that you are able to shoot the targets in other lanes.
If V wins the shooting competition:
Robert will give you a Lexington x-MOD2, and some eddies.
If V loses the shooting competition:
If you lose, the winner will complain that the weapon they've won is of low quality.
If you have enough points in Reflexes, Wilson can be asked about his situation, where he will lament that business is down and considers the shooting competition a failure as it did nothing to help boost sales in his shop. Otherwise, V can say their goodbyes to end the quest.","Go to Wilson's shooting range.

Beat_on_the_Brat:_Arroyo,Cyberpunk_2077,"This is one of the more difficult fist fights, as Buck can deal a lot of damage in one punch to the point 2-3 hits on you will cause you to lose, so it's best to plan accordingly beforehand, like consuming boosters, food, etc.
When you approach to talk to him, he'll be talking about his unique rifle, O'Five. If you have at least 8 in Body you can comment on this which will then give you the option to have him also put it up for grabs, provided you have €$ 18,000 to spare to fight him for it. Otherwise, you just need €$ 6,000 to fight him.
Note that if you got him to put up his sniper rifle, once you win he and his buddies will turn hostile and start shooting at you. At this point you're free to also use your own guns and kill them if you wish. Once they're down, go collect the gun to complete the job. You won't automatically receive your eddies if you select this method, but you can loot the prize money from Buck's body.
The normal bet will end up with Buck telling you to leave if you win. You can just directly leave the area, or talk to him. You can decide whether to provoke him or to calm him down.

Head to the Afterlife where you'll find a man, Dennis, looking for a solo to take on a job, but rather than use a fixer, he wants to cut out the middleman and have you work directly for him.
If you agree, he'll ask you to go find a marked fridge in Kabuki and once you gather the contents inside, contact him for further steps.
Head out there and it should be the fridge in the last shack out on the pier. As you might have guessed though, something is off about this: as soon as you open the fridge a rather fatigued man falls out. Call Dennis but he won't tell you the specifics about the guy, only that you need to get him to a nearby car to take him to Northside, and that Tyger Claws will try to kill him and therefore, you.
Tyger members are going to be patrolling the area and standing at the stairs, so you'll have to take them out carefully as, if your companion is killed, the job will fail. You cannot draw a weapon while carrying the man, but you are safely able to put him down on the ground and then move a certain distance to fight.
Once you get to the car, put him in the trunk, then drive to the location in Northside and talk to Dennis. Shortly after he reveals the man's name, Haruyoshi Nishikata, who you can then talk to and who'll then tell you his story: he's the world's best surgeon but the Tyger Claws' boss died on his operating table and the gang became angry at this, so Dennis helped him flee from Japan to Night City. That said, the gang doesn't know that Haruyoshi actually killed the boss on purpose.
For payment, while you'll get some eddies, make sure to also pick up the Scalpel katana that Dennis notes is your reward and is leaning against the barrels.","Go to the slum on the outskirts of Kabuki.

When V arrives in the area, they will hear the sounds of partying nearby. As they approach the nearby rooftops, they encounter multiple 6th Street gang members and their leader, Captain Sherman, sitting on a couch with Walker standing next to him.
If V draws their weapon, the job will end and all of the surrounding 6th Street gangers will turn hostile. As long as one remains polite, the captain will speak up and suppress any hostilities, allowing V to stay and participate.
One can then ask if they're doing a ""lead-spitting"" competition and he'll confirm they are and will allow V to enter if they wish, just a few rules:
You have to take a shot of alcohol before each round
You have to use the revolver on the table near the captain for the shots to count
Do not cross the yellow marquee line at each station, otherwise you will be disqualified
Take the revolver from the table, then head to the first station to begin. Note the player won't be able to save manually during these 4 stations, but can load auto saves if needed. The revolver holds 6 shots and the stations are timed. One can also allow the effects of alcohol to wear off between each station to avoid stacking penalties.
To win the prize, V needs to earn at least 44 points (of a maximum 46 possible) to beat Walker.
If V beats Walker, the captain will be impressed and offer membership into 6th Street, which will be rejected. He will warn V that any encounter in the future will likely be hostile. V can then collect their reward, Divided We Stand. V also has the option to insult Sherman, which results in the gang attacking V.
If Gig: Life's Work was completed prior to this job:
A gang member at the first station will make a remark about knowing V from somewhere. After finishing all stations, he will recognize you, causing the others to become hostile, in which case there's no way to end this quest without a fight breaking out. You can collect Divided We Stand after the fight.","See what's going on.

The side of the building has a ladder, while the interior has a set of stairs, both leading to the roof/second floor. The target in question is inside the second floor and is possible to be hit through the window, though it will make the optional goal harder.
Inside, two Militech vehicles can be scanned, plus several shelves of Militech uniforms, and crates of Militech ammunition, which triggers some choice comments by Johnny. If the target is approached stealthily, a conversation between them and an unknown Arasaka agent can be heard, detailing a plan to have José's people attack an Arasaka facility while dressed as Militech. This isn't enough to satisfy the optional goal, which requires examining the computer near where José is found, and choosing to tell the truth when the Padre calls.
If José is incapacitated rather than killed, he must be carried out of the facility and deposited in a car trunk near the street. For all the effort this takes, the payment is not any greater.","Go to the bus depot.

This gig is pretty straightforward, though you'll need to keep in mind the following about the penthouse, especially if you want the stealth reward bonus for this one:
There are 2 drones flying around, one inside and one outside.
There's a robot in a room on the second floor.
There're 3 active security cameras.
There's a couple turrets in the main room, though these only become active if the alarm is triggered.
The red security gateways will set up the alarm if walked through while active.
The drones and robot can be destroyed without triggering the alarm, provided this is done while remaining undetected. The target shard is on the second floor, in the room immediately to the left of the top of the stairs. The computer in the same office as the target shard can be used to trigger an ""emergency reset"" of the security system, which will permanently disable the drones, turrets, and robot, and shut off the red security gateways for 60 seconds. The exterior porch can also be accessed while the security gates are active via an open window in the dining room, though there is nothing of note on the porch. A bathroom on the 2nd floor can be opened with a Tech attribute check, and contains an unusually lucrative loot box.

Mama Welles asks that V joins the ofrenda that she is holding at the El Coyote Cojo for Jackie.
After arriving at the Coyoto Cojo, V speaks with Mamá Welles, who offers them a beer and asks how they are doing. V tells her that they want to take part in the ceremony as well and do it in the right tradition, but that they are unsure about what to place next to his urn. Mamá tells V not to worry and hands V the the key to Jackie's garage, and assures V that they can find something in there from Jackie's past that will be appropriate.
When V approaches the garage in the alley behind the Coyote Cojo, they find Jackie's girlfriend, Misty, is sitting in front of the garage door. V asks her what she is doing there, and she tells V that she is waiting for Jackie to return, even though she knows that won't happen. After speaking with her a bit more, they both enter the garage.
Inside the garage, V looks for a suitable offering.[N 1][N 2]
If V finds the Key to Jackie's Room:
On the desk, V finds the key that unlocks the door in the garage. Upon opening the door, Misty and V uncovered that Jackie attempted to make a mandala.

V calls Reed, who tells them that the connection to Charon Exotics that they made in Birds with Broken Wings was severed and that the plan is now to move to the Dogtown Gate to find a vantage point near the Golden Pacific Data Term and scout out the ride themselves.
After V waits several hours just before midnight, they are instructed by Reed to scan vehicles coming from Night City into Dogtown, as one of them has to be the vehicle that Aurore Cassel and Aymeric Cassel rented during their stay in Night City.
Aurore and Aymeric drive a Quadra Sport R-7 ""Charon"", that is tracked once tagged. After tagging the vehicle, V intercepts the vehicle at a parking lot below Eden Plaza, and climb inside the vehicle's trunk and connects to its security system.
If V fails to tag the car when it is entering Dogtown:
Reed will instruct V to move to plan C, and sends V coordinates to three different locations where they must go and scan for the car.
The duo eventually returns to their vehicle, ready to depart to the EBM Petrochem Stadium and meet with Kurt Hansen and Songbird.

While riding along, Joshua tells V that he was sentenced to prison twelve years ago for armed robbery amongst other things. He continues that he shot and killed several people in cold blood, but that it didn't do anything to him on the emotional level at the time. During his time in prison, he had the time to think about his actions, and thought of ways on how to correct them. Joshua asks that V sticks with him for the day, promising them payment equal to that they would have been paid for killing him. As they near their destination, Joshua will ask for a moment of time to think.[N 1]
Arriving at the El-Ahmar House, Joshua and V get out of the vehicle. As Joshua approaches the house, a woman named Zuleikha El-Ahmar greets and invites him and V in to talk. While speaking with Zuleikha, V learns that her brother, Ruben El-Ahmar, was killed by Joshua. But instead of despising Joshua for it, she began to write to him while he was in prison, forgiving him for what he did as her Christian faith told her to not judge others. Because of her letters, Joshua became a Christian himself.
Joshua will then reveal what's going on: Rachel is with a braindance recording studio that plans to record Joshua's crucifixion. Joshua hopes that this will inspire people to convert to Christianity by showing them how Jesus suffered for them. Before more can be said though, Zuleikha's mother Gloria arrives, and unlike her daughter, she hasn't forgiven Joshua and demands he and V leave.
If V decides to stay around:
Joshua and V return to the vehicle, and the group will decide to go for a meal, but Rachel would like a word in private with V first. She'll say that she thinks Joshua is nuts, but the fact that he genuinely believes what he says is valuable since it makes for better braindances. Rachel fears that V is jeopardizing this by asking ""probing questions"" which cause Joshua to doubt himself.[N 2]
Arriving at the PieZ restaurant in Rancho Coronado, Santo Domingo, Rachel  instructs Vasquez to take Stephenson inside and grab a table, so that she is able to talk with V. She offers V double Joshua's payment to walk away.[N 3][T 2]

A day later, Rachel will call V to attend Joshua's crucifixion.[T 3]

Some time after meeting with Alt Cunningham and dealing with the Voodoo Boys, V is contacted by Frank Nostra, a former colleague of them who also worked at the Arasaka Corporation's Counter Intelligence Division, who has recorded a message for them.
In the recorded message, Nostra tells V that Susan Abernathy, the director of Arasaka's North American Special Operations division, is purging the department of anybody who is not one-hundred percent on her side, and that he himself is one of the people that appeared on her radar. Not intending to wait around until the proverbial executioner would come around, he informs V that he started to put together a file on Abernathy, and that he has hidden the documents in question in a safe location. The message ends with Nostra informing V that the reason they are receiving the message is because Nostra himself was unable to make use of the documents, and expects that V will know how to handle the situation, and that they can find the documents at the attached coordinates.[N 1]
The attached coordinates lead V to a dumpster in an alley on Allen street in the Kabuki sub-district of Watson. When V approaches the dumpster, Johnny Silverhand projects himself in front of them and starts mocking V about their continued interest in the Corporate lifestyle.
If V decides to interact with Johnny:
V tells Johnny that they've still got a few scores to settle, to which Johnny will respond that he knew all along they were still into the Corporate ""rat race,"" after which V mocks Johnny for not having something more important to do.
After V moves the dumpster, they find the mentioned briefcase, which upon opening appears to be empty. V is then confronted by a disheveled and bitter, but still very much alive Frank Nostra, who currently finds himself in a similar situation that V found themselves not too long ago. In his desperation to prove Abernathy wrong, Nostra is convinced that turning over V to her will get him back into her good graces and employed at Arasaka again.
If V tells Frank that they're a nobody to Abernathy [Combat]:
V tells Nostra that Abernathy probably doesn't even know that they exist or that she even ever knew of their existence, and explains to Nostra that they were just a tool used by Arthur Jenkins in an attempt to get rid of Abernathy. V also tells Nostra that if they were both to return to the Arasaka headquarters, they would probably both be shot at on sight. Nostra replies with that he has nothing to lose, and engages combat with V.
If V tells Frank that they're pathetic:
V tells Nostra the story about another former colleague of theirs, Joey Livani, who pissed himself the day he got fired, and that they saw him as the most pathetic guy to have ever worked at Arasaka. However, V informs Nostra that they have now taken over the title of most pathetic Arasaka employee.
If V tells Frank to open his eyes [Non-Combat]:
V mocks Nostra for being a fool and trying to get back into Arasaka after they fired him without any mercy. They tell him that his time at Arasaka should be considered complete and that they should try and refigure out their life, and that Nostra has the means start a new career path in Night City if he properly uses the tools—a gun, ammunition and a little initiative—at his disposal.[N 2]
If V defeats Nostra [Combat]:
Not intending on being taken in by Nostra, V puts up a fight, resulting in Nostra's neutralization. Upon inspecting his body, V is able to snag his Iconic JKE-X2 Kenshin, the Apparition.

V tells the bouncer that he is Kerry Eurodyne's guest and the bouncer grants them access.
If Kerry forced Us Cracks to comply during the events of I Don't Wanna Hear It:
During the phone call with Kerry, V learns that Us Cracks has reneged on their promise to not perform a cover version of Kerry Eurodyne’s song User Friendly and that the band is seeking a restraining order against Eurodyne.
The Dark Matter is all but empty, and Kerry mentions that he closed the club.
If Kerry and Us Cracks amicably came to an agreement during the events of I Don't Wanna Hear It:
As V enters the lounge, a promotional event is in full swing. In the scene, packed with fans and journalists, there is initially an anime video about Us Cracks and Kerry displaying on the screen. After the screen raises, Us Cracks and Kerry appear on stage and announce that they are collaborating on a new single. A reporter says that Kerry is ""on top of his game"" and asks Kerry how the collaboration came to be, to which Kerry replies that rock is once more evolving, adding that Us cracks are ""energizing"" and ""electrifying"" and wanted to work on a new song with Kerry. The reporter notes that Kerry's depression is a thing of the past and Kerry denies that he was ever depressed or thought about retiring. Likewise, Us Cracks are full of praise for Kerry, and Blue Moon says that meeting Kerry was ""Doki doki. Love at first sight"".
V can approach them by walking through the room among the fans. Kerry will beckon V to come. After V goes there, Kerry lays his arm on V's shoulder and introduces V to the journalists as his ""right hand"". One of them will ask V what it is like to hang out with Kerry Eurodyne, and V can choose whether to answer. Then Kerry will ask V to leave the scene with him. Before V leaves, they can talk to Us Cracks about the event.[Notes 1]
Kerry introduces V to Spector Cheng, who promises Kerry to give V a ""friends and family"" discount. Kerry then leads V to the balcony on the building. V and Kerry will talk about his life and career. If V chooses to hear Kerry out, Kerry will eventually admit that he hasn’t been honest with V regarding the Us Cracks situation. Kerry reveals that the real reason why he was uncomfortable with Us Cracks performing a cover version of one of his songs was not that Kerry was afraid of becoming a puppet for corporations. What Kerry really was afraid of was being in someone else’s shadow again just like he had been in Johnny Silverhand's shadow during the Samurai years.
If V has a masculine body and voice:
V is able to kiss Kerry Eurodyne and start a romance event. After kissing, Kerry Eurodyne will stay at the rooftop a little while longer to think.
If V has a feminine body:
V is able to attempt to kiss Kerry Eurodyne, but he politely declines V's attempts, as he prefers male company instead.
V heads back down with the elevator, and departs the club.[Notes 2]","Go to the given address.

Gig:_Desperate_Measures,Phantom_Liberty,"Zetatech employee Pedro Aimar plans to steal an automated transport from his company and sell the AV thruster parts it is carrying. He reveals to V that he has ALS, and only has a few months left to save himself by undergoing a full-body conversion. While Zetatech refused to pay for the operation, Pedro found a Soviet ripperdoc named Dr. Federov in Abakan, Siberia who claims he can perform the operation relatively cheaply, and the hundreds of thousands of eurodollars that Pedro raises from this heist will cover the costs and then some. Pedro says he has secretly tampered with Zetatech's delivery route algorithm and arranged for a transport to drive through the same area at the same time every day, and all he needs V to do is get inside the transport and insert a shard so he can remotely take over the onboard computer. Pick up Pedro's shard before leaving his motel room.
Travel to the Kenmore Diner and take a seat inside to wait until 5pm, when the Zetatech transport is scheduled to pass by. As he truck crosses the intersection outside the diner, Pedro brings it to a halt by activating traffic barriers. Get into the front passenger seat of the truck quickly (taking too long will cause several Zetatech guards to arrive on the scene), and insert the shard. Pedro takes control of the vehicle and begins driving it to the drop-off point, a Tirempire garage near Megabuilding H4. On the way, Zetatech security catches up with the stolen vehicle, engaging V in a shootout. Once the pursuers are eliminated, V must drive the truck the rest of the way to the destination manually.

Run_This_Town,Phantom_Liberty,"This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝
Mr. Hands will call V at some point after finishing Firestarter to meet him in his suite at Heavy Hearts.
Mr. Hands is also very insistent on the importance of this mission. If V has any gigs from him already started when Run This Town is started they can be completed as normal, but if V attempts to start any new gigs within Dogtown Mr. Hands will message V saying that work can wait, and insist that V meet with him. The gig that V tried to start will be locked and cannot progress.
V says they do not want to play politics and tries to leave the room:
Mr. Hands will lock the door and try to persuade V by doubling their usual rate. V can either accept and continue the quest, or decline and fail the job.
V eventually accepts the job:
Mr. Hands will provide details. Mr. Hands tells V that there are two Dogtown leader candidates: Chester Bennett, Hansen's former chief aide, and Jago Szabó, his head accountant. Mr. Hands prefers Bennett to be the new leader due to his military background and close connection to Hansen providing continuity, stating that Jago is ""immature"", and that a bookkeeper is unlikely to be a good leader in a place like Dogtown.
In order to blend in and influence Dogtown politics, Mr. Hands would like V to disguise themselves as a highly respected Cuban cartel mercenary named Aguilar Nubiola (gender depending on V's), whose organization has a close relationship with Dogtown leadership. Mr. Hands will provide V with a behavioral imprint, a replica of Aguilar's gun, and their suit.
Meeting with Jago[]
After the meeting with Mr. Hands, V goes to the meeting site of Jago and Voodoo Boys. V activates the behavioral imprint and waits for the Voodoo Boys. After dealing with the Voodoo Boys, they wait for Jago.  When Jago and his bodyguard arrive, they are surprised to see Aguilar. V, disguised as Aguilar, discourages Jago from competing for leadership, and then Jago shares some information.
V allows Jago to explain:
Jago tells V that Bennett is negotiating with a dummy company backed by Arasaka and talking about collaboration, which will unlock an optional task to meet with Bennett.
Meeting with Bennett (optional)[]
If V has allowed Jago to explain, V can go to the usual meeting site between Bennett and Arasaka. After the behavioral imprint is activated, V has to take out Bennett's bodyguard waiting near the door. Johnny will suggest that V dump the body and wait for Bennett in the car.
When Bennett finishes the meeting and gets back in the car, V turns around and faces Bennett, who is confused and then shocked to see Aguilar. Bennett will try to explain what's going on.
V threatens Bennett to cut ties with Arasaka:
Bennett will turn hostile and start attacking Aguilar (V). Since V is in Aguilar's disguise, they can only use Aguilar's replicated gun to fight back; V cannot scan or use other weapons, implants or throwables.
After Bennett is defeated, Jago will be considered the leader.
V convinces Bennett to cut ties with Arasaka and says Jago will support him after the cut:
Bennett will be convinced and V can peacefully leave. Bennett will be considered the leader.
Hansen's Wake[]
After the meetings, V goes to Black Sapphire for Hansen's wake. V activates Aguilar's disguise, enters the building and heads for the elevator.
At the wake, V meets Jago, who says he has a bad feeling since Bennett has called in extra security.
Chester Bennett[]
For Bennett to be considered the new leader of Dogtown, V will have to either skip the optional meeting or go there but not provoke him.
V did not convince Jago to give up his contacts:
Bennett becomes the new leader of Dogtown and Jago is killed.
V convinced Jago to give up his contacts and didn't stop Bennett:
Bennett becomes the new leader of Dogtown and Jago is killed.
(Reflexes 10) - V convinced Jago to give up his contacts and stopped Bennett:
Jago becomes the new leader of Dogtown and Bennett is killed.
V convinced Bennett to give up on obtaining Jago's contacts:
After V draws their weapon and says ""You would plunge Dogtown into chaos?"", Bennett becomes the new leader of Dogtown and Jago survives.
Jago Szabó[]
For Jago to be considered the new leader of Dogtown, V will have to go to the optional meeting with Bennett, prompt him to attack, and say Jago will lead.
V did not convince Bennett to give up on Terra Cognita:
Bennett becomes the new leader of Dogtown and Jago is killed.
V convinced Bennett to give up on Terra Cognita:
Jago becomes the new leader of Dogtown and Bennett survives.
V convinced Jago to give Terra Cognita to Bennett:
Jago becomes the new leader of Dogtown and Bennett survives.

Never_Fade_Away_(quest),Phantom_Liberty,"While speaking with Brigitte in the Voodoo Boys' Rezo Agwe subnet, V is dragged into one of Johnny's memories.
After walking onstage and grabbing the microphone, they get sucked in deeper. Several scenes flash from the Samurai performance, with a final act of Johnny firing his Malorian sidearm. After the performance ends, V experiences the memory of Johnny for the remainder of the quest.
Kerry Eurodyne and Johnny exit the stage, all the while Kerry lashes out at Johnny for being reckless and crossing the line, stating that Samurai is not just Johnny's band and that it's not a solo act.
Johnny pushes Kerry aside while saying that he is the only one with a vision for the band's future, and tells Kerry to go fuck himself, while storming inside the dressing room, looking for drugs.
Inside the dressing room, Johnny's girlfriend, Alt Cunningham awaits him, and they engage in an intimate scene together. Afterwards, Alt tells Johnny that she is done with Samurai and what the band stands for and is leaving, but couldn't ghost Johnny without saying something. Johnny's anger is sparked once again, claiming that she and Kerry are both cowards, that they are afraid of Arasaka and that only he is the only one that can stand up to Arasaka.
While Alt dresses up, Johnny searches for his drugs once more. Though Alt leaves the building first, Johnny catches up to her and tries to make amends for his behaviour. While in the back alley, they are approached by several ominous-looking thugs. Johnny tells Alt to run and reaches for his Malorian. While managing to fire a few shots, Johnny is ultimately felled by one of the thugs equipped with Mantis Blades. The last thing Johnny sees of Alt is her being taken away by the thugs in a van.
Shortly after, while seemingly on his last legs, Johnny is saved by media Lyle Thompson. Lyle manages to bring Johnny to Milt Nauman, a ripperdoc and old friend of Johnny. Several hours pass as Nauman manages to put Johnny back in one piece. While Johnny gets back on his feet, he tells Lyle that he suspects that Arasaka are the ones behind the abduction, to which Lyle responds that this may be true as she was working on software for ITS that Arasaka wanted to acquire. They set out for the Atlantis to meet with Rogue, Johnny's ex-lover and a Solo, who may be able to help with rescuing Alt.
Arriving at the Atlantis, Thompson stays in the car to wait for Johhny's return. Once inside, Johnny heads onto the second floor and speaks with Engels at the door to gain access to Rogue.
Rogue is waiting with Santiago, a Nomad, for a possible client, but there seems to be no client coming as there are several emptied bottles. Johnny suggests that they both come with him to raid Arasaka Tower in order to save Alt. They both agree, but soon after they're attacked by Arasaka goons that have swarmed the Atlantis in force. They fight their way out and meet up with Lyle outside.
While making their escape in Johnny's Porsche, and after shaking off their pursuers, they plan their attack on Arasaka Tower by staging a diversion in front of it.
Once inside Arasaka Tower, they fight their way through the Arasaka soldiers to find the mainframe. The mainframe is guarded by Akira, a skilled Arasaka agent. After neutralizing Akira, head inside the room where Alt is being kept and attempt to save her. In his anger Johnny shoots Toshiro, Alt's handler, and disconnects her prematurely, severing the connection she has with her body. While mourning the loss of Alt, Johnny gets frustrated and lashes out at Lyle, who is still recording everything, and nearly beats him to death, only being halted by Rogue.
After Rogue confirms that Alt has deceased, V is sucked out of the memory and returns to Rezo Agwe.","Grab the microphone.

The_Rescue,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Rewrite from V's perspective]
The quest starts out with a montage of your exploits with Jackie in Night City. Six months later, V find themselves in their car alongside Jackie, discussing the job they're hired to complete by Wakako Okada.
V learns that the missing woman is probably in a den of Scavengers in room 1237 of a certain apartment block. T-Bug helps unlocking the main door and disabling the security system.
Upon getting inside, you and Jackie will head through two rooms, the second of which has the corpse of a woman packed with Zetatech repros on a table. The third room will contain your first enemy, which you will need to sneak up to and either kill or knock out before throwing his body in the container in front of him. Sneak up to the area next to the main room with Jackie, where you will need to wait for two more scavs to head through. Sneak up on one of them and then kill or incapacitate him.
There are five scavs to deal with in the main room, which you can take out however you like. You will also need to deal with the Scav Leader, who is packing some serious heat in the form of a Militech Mk. 31 HMG, which can and will kill you in seconds if you're open to him. Either take cover and blast him with whatever weapons you got off the scavs until he's dead, take the route that T-Bug gives you and provide cover fire so that Jackie can tackle and incapacitate him, or use a quickhack to distract him using the light in his chamber before sneaking up and dealing with him however you wish.
Once you've gotten past the scavengers, you and Jackie enter a bathroom on the other side of the apartment. In a bathtub you will find the missing woman, whose name is Sandra Dorsett, packed in ice with a dead man. While alive, she is medically unstable and requires you to save her using an AirHypo when she starts flatlining. After removing the GPS jammer which prevented Sandra's Trauma Team Platinum alert from activating, carry Sandra to the balcony where Trauma Team will arrive via an Atlus AV, order you to place Sandra on the stretcher they lay down and then extract her. You and Jackie must then leave using another elevator. Contact Wakako and tell her the job is done. It doesn't matter which of the options you pick.
On the drive back to V's home at Megabuilding H10 in Watson, you and Jackie will be ambushed by a van full of more scavengers. There are four scavs to deal with, two of whom open fire from the rear doors, another of whom fires on you upon opening a side door later on during the attack, and the driver. Deal with them quickly by shooting them with your pistol so you don't take too much damage, though if you don't take out all four scavs, the van will eventually crash and kill them all regardless.
You will then arrive at a NCPD blockade at the border of Watson, though Jackie will be able to convince an officer to let you pass, and then drive until you see a situation involving some gangoons running foul of a MaxTac squad and getting slaughtered. Finally, Jackie will drop you off before leaving to see his girlfriend. Head up to your apartment, where you will have the option to check your stash. Lying down on the bed will end the quest.","Follow Jackie.

Career_Opportunities,Phantom_Liberty,"After obtaining the high-score in Trauma Drama, you are contacted by Macroware, the developers of the arcade game.
Macroware instructs you to visit the Trauma Team netpage from your computer and navigate to the ""We want YOU!"" tab, and apply for an unpaid internship with Trauma Team. This can be done after logging in under ""Trauma Drama Member Access"" and signing in. On the ""We want YOU!"" page you can apply.
After applying, go to MedCenter to collect your rewards, a Trauma Team uniform and a Mini Trauma Team AV that can be displayed in your apartment","Read the message from Macroware.
Go to the Trauma Team netpage on your computer.
Go to the MedCenter to collect your consolation prize.

Collect your consolation prize."
Gig:_Treating_Symptoms,Phantom_Liberty,"Indira Barazza has fallen victim to blackmail by Milko Alexis, a Netrunner affiliated with the Voodoo Boys. He's threatened to hack Indira's lungs if she refuses to comply with their demands. The victim reached out to Mr. Hands, who in turn hired V to resolve the situation and neutralize the threat.
V travels to Milko's base of operations in Dogtown, the Luxor High Wellness Spa, in order to make direct contact with Milko and deal with those that stand in their way.
If V encounters and talks with the supplier:
While navigating through the base, V encounters their supplier, who has a deal with the Voodoo Boys and supplies them with implants used for research purposes. V then asks if he knows about Milko's whereabouts, to which he responds that he doesn't.
If V chastises the supplier for his lack of thanks:
The supplier argues back, claiming that he had the situation under control until V showed up.
If V intimidates the supplier with physical force:[N 1]
V pushes the supplier against the wall to coerce him into talking. He still refuses, prompting V to punch him in the face until he finally shares what he knows.
The supplier explains that the Voodoo Boys take most of the implants and dismantle them in order to study their software and research new exploits. The leftover implants are installed in old combat robots. Of these robots, one in particular has proven useful to them.
He then offers to patch into the server room where the robots are kept and sabotage the servers to render them explosive.
If V offers a bribe of €$500:
V attempts to bribe the supplier into divulging information with 500 eurodollars. He accepts the money, explains the purpose of the implants, and offers to sabotage the server room where the robots are stored.
V enters the server room, where a group of Robot R Mk.2s are deployed to eliminate the intruder. After V neutralizes the squad leader,[N 2] all of the other robots in the server room self-destruct and the emergency exit protocol is engaged. V follows the emergency exit hallway to find another man standing alongside a jacked-in Milko. He introduces himself as Alan Noël, an undercover NetWatch agent tasked with infiltrating the Voodoo Boys' ranks.
He explains that his mission was to dismantle their criminal network from within, and that he needs Milko alive so that he can piggyback off of his connection and glean as much information as possible. He asks for V to spare Milko in order to continue his mission.
If V spares Milko and Alan:
After V leaves the Voodoo Boys hideout, they receive a call from Mr. Hands. He informs V that Indira Barazza was just added to NetWatch's witness protection list, guarding her against virtually any potential attack.
Mr. Hands pays you an extra €$8,000 for your efforts.
Later on V gets a message from  Alan Noël where he informs V about successful operation of uncovering a puppet master behind blackmail criminal network and invites V to get her hands on some stuff he left for her near Voodoo Boys' base in Luxor Heights, Dogtown. This message trigger side quest Corpo Of The Month that rewards V with some rewards, including a Netrunner skill shard.
If V refuses Alan's offer:
V declines Alan's offer, instead neutralizing him and Milko in order to fulfill the contract as originally planned.","Get inside the Voodoo Boys' base.
Find Milko Alexis.
Talk to the supplier. [Optional]
Neutralize Milko Alexis.
Talk to the Netrunner. [Optional]

Gig:_Hippocratic_Oath,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Write from V's perspective]
The Clean Cut clinic has three security cameras and a handful of Maelstrom gang members patrolling the area. Lucy is in the far back left room, trying to save one of the gang's badly-injured members, Hans Otto. Despite being held against her will though, she's fully committed in trying to save him and tries to get you to help her.
If you agree to help, instead of continuing with the dialogue, follow her instructions, namely scanning the guy with your optics when asked and then getting the synthetic blood from the table nearby and applying it to the Maelstrom member. You can then talk for a moment before she'll finally leave with you.
If you aren't interested in helping, shooting the patient will also convince Lucy to leave with you.","Go to the Clean Cut building.

Changes,Phantom_Liberty,"As long as the ending path ends with V connecting into Mikoshi (hence this excludes the Arasaka and Phantom Liberty paths), the player will be presented with this mission.
Changes can start in one of two ways, which depends on the choice the player makes regarding Jackie's body after The Heist. However, the mission will open up in similar fashion; V will be presented with a vision of them going to the ninth floor behind Misty's shop, as is what happened during the third half of Nocturne Op55N1.
If V took Jackie's body to Viktor Vektor after thus resulting in Arasaka stealing his engram, V will be given one last chance to talk to him.
If V took Jackie's body to Mama Welles or if the body was left in the Delamain Cab they escaped on, upon exiting into the roof, V finds their bullet necklace and takes it as the world around them fades away.
Either way, this will lead to the cyberspace inside Mikoshi. Alt Cunningham will recite a poem (both listed below) as V walks towards the beam of light, taking them into another section of cyberspace. After doing so, V will have a talk.
If the mission prior to this is Belly of the Beast or (Don't Fear) The Reaper, V will talk to Johnny Silverhand.
If the previous mission was Knockin' on Heaven's Door, the opposite will happen, as Johnny by that point had taken control of V's body.
The conversation soon shifts into a shocking realization for V; with Alt having separated their and Johnny's psyches throughout the raid on Arasaka Tower, the extended exposure to Johnny's construct has irreparably damaged their body. Alt gives them a choice; return to their body with six months to live, or let Johnny keep their body.
What follows after Changes if V returns to their body depends on the previous mission. If the previous mission was (Don't Fear) The Reaper or Knockin' on Heaven's Door, Changes will always lead to Path of Glory. If the previous mission was Belly of the Beast, the next mission will be All Along the Watchtower.
If Changes ends with Johnny keeping their body, the mission will always lead to New Dawn Fades, disregarding the previous mission and any ending path.","Go to the roof.
If Jackie was not delivered to Viktor at the end of The Heist:
Pick up the necklace.
If Jackie was delivered to Viktor Vektor at the end of The Heist:
Talk to Jackie.
If the previous mission was Belly of the Beast or (Don't Fear) The Reaper:
Talk to Johnny.
Enter the well to return to your body.
If the previous mission was Knockin' on Heaven's Door:
Talk to V.
Enter the well to return to V's body.
Cross the bridge and enter cyberspace forever.
Touch Alt to leave with her into the unknown."
Upgrade_U,Phantom_Liberty,"After installing Patch 2.0 or newer, V will receive a call from Viktor Vektor that new cyberware software has hit the market, and has become available to them.
V can then proceed to visit any Ripperdoc to install their software update, in the form of a tutorial that informs about all the changes made to the Cyberware interface in Patch 2.0.
At the Ripperdoc, V has to install a Kiroshi ""Sentry"" Optics, Smart Link, and Subdermal Armor for free. After doing so, the quest will complete.","Talk to Viktor/Read the message from Viktor.
Install the cyberware update at any ripperdoc clinic."
Sex_On_Wheels,Phantom_Liberty,"About a day after returning Jake Estevez's pickup truck, V is contacted by Jake and instructed to go to a garage at the cargo station in Rancho Coronado, Santo Domingo.
Once at the garage, V can get behind the wheel of their new Quadra Turbo-R V-Tech.","Go to the garage near the cargo station.
Get in the car.
Leave the area."
Hi_Ho_Silver_Lining,Phantom_Liberty,"After completing all of Mr. Hands's gigs in Pacifica and Dogtown, V is asked to return to Heavy Hearts Club for a reward. After talking with Mr. Hands outside the club, V will be rewarded with the Quadra Sport R-7 ""Sterling"".

Coin_Operated_Boy,Phantom_Liberty,"When you go to Brendan's usual location outside Megabuilding H8, you will find an upset Theo Price is standing where his unit used to be. She'll explain that Brendan's owners had him taken away to ""re-evaluate"" his code, dismissing her pleas that he was a true friend and more than a simple S.C.S.M. unit.
At the SoftSys shop in Heywood, you can either bribe or convince (requires Technical Ability) the clerk to receive access to the room where Brendan is receiving a firmware update. Once in the room, Brendan notes he's being updated because he mentioned someone's marital troubles and the person didn't like that very much (you can also see this message on the computer next to him confirming it). With sufficient Technical Ability, you can deduce that Brendan is not a true AI, but instead possessed an exceptional convo-emulating algorithm to facilitate his interactions with visitors. He'll then ask you to tell Theo a message from him and give you one last joke if you wish.
Return to Theo to pass along Brendan's message to conclude the job.","Go to the service point.

Behind this car is a metal shelf that has collapsed, covering a small container. The key to the Quadra is inside this container.","Search the warehouse.
Get in the car."
Dazed_and_Confused,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: This isn't how a walkthrough should be written on this wiki. Don't write a gameplay walkthrough, but write a story walkthrough. Don't use bullet points, use {{Condition}} instead.]
After starting You Know My Name, V is contacted by Mr. Hands that he has received an interesting item of business. Lina Malina, a local Braindance celebrity, claims that she has been kidnapped and is currently held against her will in a rental studio by the name of Brainporium.
Brainporium can be found atop Jason Exiled in Dogtown, Pacifica.
Inside the Brainporium, V can find Edgar Tool, a man being held captive in a room claiming that he's Lina Malina. V can ask Shank who's standing guard outside about what's going on, and Shank will lead V upstairs to can explain the situation. Alternatively, V can convince Shank to let Tool go, or use the code 1111 on the door, though this will end the mission early with no rewards beyond a thank you kiss from ""Lina.""
Shank will explain that Tool has been a big fan of Lina, but that after a power outage while watching one of Lina's BD's, Tool now believes himself to be Lina. After talking to Shank about Tool's situation, V is directed to Lina's apartment. Before she enters, a group of Scavs will be scattered around the area guarding the place. V has the option to:
Take out all the Scavs (If you hide their bodies Lina will act like they left, unaware of the bloodshed)
Explain to them the situation and get them to leave (StreetKid only)
Break in from an industrial shutter (20 Tech) or from the top of her apartment, then read about her schedule. V can use Lina's schedule to have the Scavs leave without bloodshed.
Either way, V will need the Scavs to leave and wait until dark. Lina will be disappointed by the disappearance of her guards when she arrives and V will have some options to convince her for the shoot:
Telling Lina the truth about Tool's condition will fail the quest.
You can pay her €$10,000 to participate in the braindance.
You can send her the picture you took of Kerry Eurodyne and Us Cracks to persuade her if I Don't Wanna Hear It has been completed.
She can be convinced by mentioning Rachel Casich if They Won't Go When I Go has been completed.
A Corpo V has an option to convince Lina to participate in the BD shoot.
With a high enough intelligence, you can hack the computer on her kitchen wall and add in the BD shoot to her schedule yourself. When Lina arrives, you can tell her that you've been sent by her agent to make sure she knows, which after checking her schedule she accepts without any further convincing.
Shank will arrange for the shoot the next day, and V can sleep the night at the nearby Kress Street Apartment. After reaching the Brainporium V finds Lina and Tool arguing, requiring V to direct the BD shoot.
Directing Lina to ""Tell him that he's your sister"" results in the best BD. Lina will leave Baby Boomer, and later gift you the Malina-mobile.
Directing Lina to ""Convince him that he's a clone created by the FIA"" results in an okay BD, but no further shoots. Lina will leave Baby Boomer, and later gift V Lina Malina's T-shirt.
Sending Tool's letter as Lina's lines result in a bad BD, with Lina leaving, but Tool restored to himself.
V has the option of calling either Viktor Vektor or Judy Álvarez about the situation. Either one will give the advice of inducing cognitive dissonance, and a new side objective to find an item with personal importance to Tool will appear.","Rescue Lina from the BD store.
Find Lina Malina.
Talk to the strangers in the basement.
If V frees Tool from the basement:

Talk to Tool.
Message Mr. Hands to tell him the job is done.

If V follows Shank:

Follow Shank.
Talk to Shank.
Find Lina at her residence.
Text Viktor for advice about Tool. [Optional]
Text Judy for advice about Tool. [Optional]
Find something that carries sentimental value for Tool. [Optional]
Scan the letter in the basement. [Optional]
Talk to Edgar. [Optional]
Find Lina Malina.

If V talks to the Scavengers:

Persuade the gangers to leave.
If V engages the Scavengers:

Dispose of the gangers.

Convince Lina to participate in the BD shoot.

Notes[]
Completing the quest will result in Brainporium permanently closing.
If you broke into Lina's apartment, she sends V a text message about it, wanting to desperately leave Dogtown.
If you hide a corpse in Lina's fridge, she texts you to ask if you know anything about it.
Sending Tool's Letter as the script will cause Lina to leave the BD shoot disgruntled.
This option will result in Johnny providing positive feedback to the player. However, Lina will not send a message to V, no gifts will be rewarded.
The ""sister"" option leads to continued BDs with Lina and TooLina, and them heading to Night City. Depending on how the Sinnerman questline ends, Rachel Casich will message V about their pitch for the ""Lina & Toolina"" show.
If the job Sweet Dreams was completed prior to starting Dazed and Confused, V will compare Tool's state to what happened to them because of Stefan's BD when texting Victor.
Trivia[]
The quest is named after the 1967 song ""Dazed and Confused"" by Jake Holmes.

Gig:_Concrete_Cage_Trap,Phantom_Liberty,"V is tasked with finding and escorting the client, Tiny Mike, out of a Kabuki housing block alive, as he is being hunted by Militech for stealing data from a lab in the Badlands for Regina.
A stealthy path to Tiny Mike's location involves entering the block via a fire escape. Two locals loitering on the perimeter will point out that the fire escape can be reached by climbing a nearby vending machine and jumping from some pipes. Once on the fire escape, climb to the second level instead of entering the open window, and follow the catwalk. Watch out for a Militech drone on the ground to the left which has a partial view of the catwalk, and two Militech soldiers guarding an open apartment along the way. At the end of the catwalk, jump down and continue heading forward to a ladder close by. Climb up and head straight to enter the third floor of the building where Tiny Mike is hiding.
Tiny Mike is in an apartment on the second floor, in the bathroom. When prompted, grab his air hypo from the desk and give it to him, which gives him the strength to move, but not to help in any fighting. He allows V to take his personal weapon, the Hypercritical, which is sitting on the sink, to make up for it. Next, follow him downstairs, where he gives V the option to let him open up an alternate exit through an adjacent restaurant. Going through Tiny Mike's escape route is faster and avoids any remaining guards, but three Militech soldiers may still be patrolling outside the restaurant. It is possible to eliminate each of them quietly, but their patrol routines do allow a brief window where none of them are looking directly at the restaurant's entrance.
However V and Tiny Mike escape the block, enter the vehicle that Regina sent to leave the area and complete the gig","Get inside the lockdown area.

"Both_Sides,_Now",Phantom_Liberty,"After meeting with the Voodoo Boys, V is contacted by Judy Álvarez, who asks them to come over as soon as possible.[N 1]
As V arrives at the apartment building on Charter street in Northside, Watson, they enter her apartment, and get immediately called over to the bathroom by Judy.
Inside the bathroom, V is encountered with a gruesome scene. Judy's friend and your former client, Evelyn Parker, committed suicide. Judy explains that she was away at the time when it happened, and is unable to forgive herself for leaving the apartment. Wanting to go through the proper channels, Judy calls the NCPD to report the incident, and asks that V carries Evelyn's body to the bedroom.
While V carries Evelyn's body to the bedroom, Judy is giving the NCPD an earful, as they appear to not have the time to come over to the apartment and investigate the suicide. After hanging up, Judy joins V in the bedroom and asks that V leaves the room while she takes care of her friend.
Moment pass, and Judy and V find themselves on the roof of the apartment building, passing the time. Judy asks V for a cigarette, which they take from Evelyn's cigarette case. Visibly emotional, Judy tells V that they can keep the cigarette case, as she thinks they like having it.
Judy will note to V that Fingers, the ripperdoc they met with earlier, had Evelyn for four days, and will also note that she talked with Tom Caldera from Clouds, who has told her that Evelyn had been missing from the place for a full week. Unable to sleep because she didn't know what happened to Evelyn during those three missing days, she dug deeper in the virtus she recovered from Evelyn's recording implant, trying to uncover more information. Judy was able to find out that Oswald Forrest, the manager of Clouds, kept her for those three days and had his way with her, before selling her off to the Scavengers.
Unsure with how to proceed, Judy asks that V leaves them alone for now so they can think on how to proceed, and promises to stay in touch with V.[N 2]","Go to Judy's apartment.

Pyramid_Song,Phantom_Liberty,"To unlock this side quest, do not side with Maiko or don't take her money in Pisces:
Some time after the events at Clouds, Judy calls V to meet her at an abandoned shack near Laguna Bend Reservoir at sunrise.
Once V arrives, Judy explains what she wants to do here. She tells V that she wants to go diving in the lake where the shack is located, and record a braindance of them doing so. V agrees to do so, and puts on a diving suit. After V puts on a braindance scroller, which links their brains, they dive into the lake together. While in the water, V calibrates their suit by swimming around Judy, then swimming backwards, then finally letting her hum a song to check auditory responses.
Once calibrated, Judy and V use a pole to dive down to Laguna Bend, Judy's old hometown that has since been flooded. Judy will talk about the different locations they come across, while V has the opportunity to locate and scan a few objects, with memories of Judy's childhood playing in their head throughout. They first come across a restaurant and her home, in which V can scan and talk about the restaurant's sign, an old photo, and a hockey stick. V can also pick up and give Judy an old camera nearby. They then come across a gas station, in which V can scan and talk about an umbrella, a doll, and an abandoned car.
After moving on from the gas station, they come across a church. V must find a way into the church. After finding a way inside the church, Judy begins talking about her memories near the altar. While she is doing so, V's relic malfunctions, causing them to pass out.
V wakes up on the dock to Judy performing CPR on V, and Judy is relieved when V wakes up. She then offers for V to stay the night at the house. V goes into the house with Judy afterwards. Soon after, V must go outside to start the generator to power the house. While outside, V will hear Judy's memories of Evelyn Parker. When V returns, Judy will have gone to the bathroom. V enters to check in on her, and Judy talks about what happened as a result of the raid on Clouds.
If V is female and chooses to romance Judy:
V gets affectionate with Judy. Judy takes V to the bedroom, and they have sex on the bed. V wakes up in the morning with Judy beside them, although she gets out of the bed before V wakes up.
After V dresses, she meets Judy sitting on the dock. Judy asks V what they think their day prior meant to V.
If V chooses ""A pleasant distraction"":
Judy becomes upset, and she will immediately leave not just the area, but Night City as a whole, and delete V from her contacts.
If V chooses any other option:
Judy and V form a couple, causing Judy to stay in Night City. She gives V access to her apartment through personal link, allowing them to visit at any time.
If V is male or chooses not to kiss Judy:
Judy goes to bed once they finish talking in the bathroom.
If V goes to bed instead of leaving:
V wakes up the next morning and meets Judy sitting on the dock. She will explain to them that she is leaving Night City, and gives V access to her now vacant apartment.","Meet Judy in the early evening.

From the beginning of Act 2, on the floor below your apartment, you can find two police officers knocking on the door of Barry Lewis's apartment. Barry, an ex-cop who's so distraught over his friend's death that he left the force, has holed up in his apartment due to severe depression. Nadia Petrova and Juan Mendez will eventually see you and ask if you can see what's going on with Barry as he's refusing to answer them. You can try to knock on his door now, but Barry will refuse to answer, so come back in a few hours to try again.
This time Barry will answer and eventually let you in, talking about a really bad case he had to work that got swept under the rug and losing his close friend, Andrew, made it worse for him.
At this point you can either talk to his friends who are nearby, or go visit the columbarium in North Oak to learn more. If you choose to not visit the grave and talk to the cops, Barry will end up losing his life to suicide and you'll later find a distraught Mendez outside his apartment.
If you don't want to fail the quest, head out to the grave to learn Andrew wasn't a person, but actually a pet turtle. You can then confront the police officers with this information, in which case Mendez will open up to Barry about his own tough cases and talk to Barry.","Talk to the cops.

When inquired about what is wrong, the man, Jesse Johnson, will tell V that their Mr. Studd implant is having a malfunction and that they need to visit a ripperdoc as soon as possible.
If V decides to help Jesse:
Jesse instructs V to drive him to the nearest ripperdoc clinic operated by Cassius Ryder in Northside. While on their way there, there are several roadblocks that hinder their travel.
If V manages to get to the clinic in time:
V was able to drive Jesse to Cassius's clinic in time, ensuring Jesse's survival. Jesse called V some time after the operation, letting them know the operation was successful and that they are thankful for V's help. As a reward, he transfer them a payment of 1940 eurodollars.
If V fails to get to the clinic in time:
V was unable to drive Jesse to Cassius's clinic in time, as the implant exploded during travel, causing the man to die from his injuries. A niche dedicated to Jesse was installed at the Columbarium in North Oak, Westbrook.
If V leaves Jesse:

V is tasked with eliminating Blake Croyle, a high-ranking Animals gang member who forcibly took over a clinic in Kabuki, in order to reclaim it for the client and original owner, Roger Wang.
V will later find out through computer messages that Roger had initially contacted Blake to discuss the possibility of taking out a loan, but an agreement was never reached. Despite this, Blake claimed Roger still owed him a debt for the use of his time, and for the ""business advice"" he provided, while revealing the fact that he knew Roger's daughter had recently gotten pregnant and lives in Kabuki.
Roger recognized the thinly veiled threat and wired the money immediately, hoping to settle matters once and for all. However, Blake was still not satisfied and pressured him into surrender his clinic as well. Again, Roger seemingly complied without protest.
Unbeknownst to Blake though, this time Roger had also hired fixer Regina Jones to deal with him permanently.","Go to the store seized by Blake.

Meet with Sergei Karasinsky and he will tell you to drive a car to the Tyger Claws as a peace offering. He implies that the peace offering is more than just a car, but he does not elaborate and leaves after unlocking the garage containing the car.
When you enter the garage for the car, you can inspect the trunk immediately or ignore it. If you do not inspect the trunk before driving the car, you will hear pleas from the trunk while driving. If you open the trunk anytime before getting to the restaurant, you will find Alex Pushkin, a Biotechnica employee who refused an offer from the Tyger Claws and whom Sergei kidnapped to give to them to buy a pardon.
If you open the trunk and talk to Alex, you will have the option to either free him or close the trunk and deliver him to the Tyger Claws. If you are a Nomad and have previously completed Gig: Guinea Pigs, an additional dialogue option will appear that reveals Alex worked with Joanne Koch on testing a new product in the Badlands that killed dozens of members of the Red Ocher nomad clan; Alex expresses no remorse for his role in the tragedy and likens the victims to roaches.
If you deliver Alex and the car to the Tyger Claws' restaurant as contracted, the gig is successfully completed. Wakako Okada will additionally praise you for your discretion if you did not free Alex. Otherwise, he will pay you double what Sergei would have given you. Wakako will be surprised that you showed mercy to a corpo and left Sergei holding the bag, but remarks that Sergei was simply outbid and closes the contract.
If anything is done to antagonize the Tyger Claws while delivering Alex to the restaurant, they will turn hostile and an objective to kill them is given. After this is completed, the quest can only be finished by freeing Alex.
Alternatively, you can kill Alex yourself or attempt to drive him out of Night City, but both actions result in failing the gig and disappointing Wakako.","Meet Sergei at the designated location.

Gig:_Playing_for_Keeps,Phantom_Liberty,"Regina Jones sends V to the Kashuu Hanten eatery in Little China, a front for a Tyger Claws operated illegal casino, to retrieve an implant a man named Jacob Lamb gambled away.
After arriving in front of the eatery, V can take the alley to the right and enter through the back door guarded by a Racketeer. Once inside, there is a Kunoichi around the corner to the left and the implant is locked in the storage room. The door can be forced open passing a Body check. Otherwise, scanning it will add the optional objective to find the bar staff key. Either way, after opening the door, V can take the implant, leave through the back door and deposit it in the Drop Point to complete the gig.
Alternatively, if V checks the file on the computer, they will find out the Tyger Claws have been using their own implants to rig the games and win against the gamblers. This will add the optional objective of blackmailing the bartender. To do so, V must leave through the alley and return to the front door. Once confronted with the acquired evidence, the bartender will give Jacob Lamb's implant to V, but says they are both not welcome there anymore.","Go to the Kashuu Hanten bar in Little China.

Ghost_Town,Phantom_Liberty,"Head to the Afterlife and look for Rogue Amendiares, Night City's top fixer and Johnny Silverhand's ex-lover. Asking her about Anders Hellman results in Rogue demanding money in exchange for her help. After paying her and waiting a day, Rogue provides V with an information Shard. V slots it in, learning that the Kang-Tao transport is carrying an anonymous person, presumed to be Hellman. In order to take down the AV and interrogate Hellman, V must first recruit a driver named Panam Palmer, a nomad merc who can help. Rogue states that V must help Panam get her car back in exchange.
After contacting Panam and meeting up with her at the Rancho Coronado Container Freight Station, V explains the situation, offering info on Panam's cargo in return. She demands to know the location of her car, which V reveals is in Rocky Ridge. Panam agrees on the condition that they get her car first. She also explains that her partner, Nash, stole her vehicle and their cargo and plans to sell it in Rocky Ridge.
Panam calls the client, Boz, and agrees to meet over the phone. Panam explains she used to drive for Boz, a 6th Street gang member she refers to as a ""good guy."" They must go to the Aldecaldo Camp to pick up her friends to help.
Upon arriving at the camp, V meets Scorpion and Mitch, two of Panam's friends. The two tell Panam that Saul, the camp's leader, has order them to watch the generators until they are brought online, barring them from helping. However, Mitch offers the duo to take any gear they might need instead.
Panam and V arrive at the ghost town of Rocky Ridge. Panam checks the substation while V scan's the power source and fusebox. Panam plans to use the substation to confuse the Raffen with the traffic lights. They wait for the Raffen to approach and commence with the plan. After the Raffen have been disposed of and they have recovered Panam's car, Panam states that they need to track down Nash. Here, V can choose to help Panam or not.
If V decides to help Panam:
Panam explains that she granted Nash her trust, and he betrayed her. Her and V go to the Raffen Shiv's hideout to hunt him down.
While driving, they discuss the plan to meet the 6th street gang at the Sunset Motel. They arrive at the motel and Panam hands off a package of merch to Boz. They head inside the hotel and order a drink from the bartender Noah. Panam reveals that the package contained Betahaloperidol, ""drugs for the cyberpsychos in our midst.""

Balls_to_the_Wall,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Partial rewrite from V's perspective]
The marker for this side job is found by a BARGHEST garrison in front of the Black Sapphire hotel in Dogtown.
V will be called out by a recruit named Paco Torres, who is currently drinking his problems away, alongside his companion Babs Okoye. V can hear him out, and after introductions Paco will share the story of an op lead by Kurt Hansen that went wrong.
At one point, Paco will offer to take V on a ""Deep Dive"", i.e. using drugs to make Paco's story more vivid. If V accepts, they will inhale the drugs, and the viewpoint will then shift from V into Kurt Hansen. As Kurt Hansen, talk to Yuri Bychkov, then go down into the lobby where Paco is standing. Talk to Paco to initiate a fist fight, with the goal being to defeat Paco. Once Paco is defeated, Hansen will assign Paco to convoy duty, and the game transitions back to V's viewpoint.
Paco will confess that he had been skimming cargo from the convoy. V is then asked to take another Deep Dive, which transitions them back to Hansen's viewpoint. This time, Hansen will be a passenger in a truck driven by Paco, moments before they are jumped by Scavengers in vehicles. A gunfight will ensue in which Hansen must defeat any pursuing vehicles using his Bald Eagle revolver. The truck is stopped by Scavengers manning a barricade, and Hansen will then disembark to fight them. Hansen only has his revolver and his Fang knife to defeat the Scavengers with, though they were accompanied by some Barghest soldiers that supported them. After defeating all of the Scavengers, Hansen approached one of the wounded Scavenger being tended to by Yuri.
The viewpoint will transition back to V, and Paco will reveal the gist of the story: the convoy was carrying generators, which Paco stole before selling them for cash, and now Paco and Babs want to ask V for advice on what to do. V can offer to tell them to either frame Yuri for the crime, leave Dogtown immediately, or have V call some friends for help (requires that certain Side jobs be completed beforehand).
If V tells them to frame Yuri:
Paco and Babs will agree with V's plan and give V both of their contact info, after which V, Paco, and Babs will agree to meet by the underpass beneath The Needle the following day. Either go to the meeting site and sit on the marked location to fast forward 24 hours, or wait 24 hours and go to the location. V will be met by Yuri, who then proceeds to open fire. Defeating Yuri will allow his body to be looted for Tier 5 weapons, and a message shard between him and Hansen that tells Yuri to hang Paco's body under The Needle. Go to the designated point, where V can find Paco's body hanging from the ceiling, at which point V can message Babs to check on her. Messaging Babs will reveal that she had called in a favor and escaped Dogtown to fly to Kenya.
If V tells them to leave Dogtown:
Babs will offer to stay behind in Dogtown to reduce suspicion on them both. After adding Paco and Bab into the contact list, V must follow Paco to the latter's car, where V can then ask Paco to get in the trunk. Drive the car to the marked location by the Grand Imperial Mall, then open up the trunk to let Paco out, after which he will then ask V to wait for two days. After 48 hours, a message from Paco will ask for a meeting by the Afterlife. Paco will be waiting outside near the Afterlife Fast Travel point, and will then tell V that he's giving them his assault rifle as a gift, and that he has joined the Scavengers. After arguing with Paco about their choice, V can then loot the Carmen DA8 Umbra from the chair it's laying on.
If V calls their friends for favors:
This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Subdivide in conditions for the specific friends]
V will offer to contact one of their friends to either smuggle Paco and Babs out of Dogtown or find generators to replace the ones Paco sold.
The available contacts that can be called depends on the character-related Side jobs that V has completed beforehand, giving them the choice of calling in favors from River Ward, Panam Palmer, or Rogue Amendiares to help, and V can then message them about the situation. Panam can help smuggle the two out of Night City, while River can supply replacement generators for the two out of an NCPD evidence locker in Santo Domingo. Rogue can be messaged about sourcing generators, but considers it too small time for her to directly supply them, instead directing V to the generators seized by the NCPD, which they will need to go through River to collect. Depending on which combination of favors are called in, after waiting 24 hours Paco will message V that they've either been successfully smuggled out of Dogtown and plan to leave Night City, or have received enough generators to avert suspicion from their superiors and intend to be more cautious in their black market entrepreneurship. As a reward, they will leave a crate in their tent in the Barghest garrison, on the chair where Paco was sitting, containing the Carmen DA8 Umbra, a Skill Shard: Solo, and €$8000.","This section requires expanding.

Beat_on_the_Brat:_Arroyo,Phantom_Liberty,"This is one of the more difficult fist fights, as Buck can deal a lot of damage in one punch to the point 2-3 hits on you will cause you to lose, so it's best to plan accordingly beforehand, like consuming boosters, food, etc.
When you approach to talk to him, he'll be talking about his unique rifle, O'Five. If you have at least 8 in Body you can comment on this which will then give you the option to have him also put it up for grabs, provided you have €$ 18,000 to spare to fight him for it. Otherwise, you just need €$ 6,000 to fight him.
Note that if you got him to put up his sniper rifle, once you win he and his buddies will turn hostile and start shooting at you. At this point you're free to also use your own guns and kill them if you wish. Once they're down, go collect the gun to complete the job. You won't automatically receive your eddies if you select this method, but you can loot the prize money from Buck's body.
The normal bet will end up with Buck telling you to leave if you win. You can just directly leave the area, or talk to him. You can decide whether to provoke him or to calm him down. If you decide to provoke him, Buck and his friends will proceed to attack you, and his rifle O'Five will be immediately be available for you to get.
Once they're down, go collect the gun to complete the job.","Go to the fight in Arroyo.

Sinnerman,Phantom_Liberty,"Some time after capturing Anders Hellman, V is contacted by Wakako Okada. Wakako offered V a job from one of her more demanding clients, Bill Jablonsky. Jablonsky wants to exact revenge for the murder of his wife, Caroline Jablonsky. The client wants everything to go exactly as planned, and is willing to pay V handsomely in return.
Wakako instructs V to meet with the client on at the Dewdrop Inn on the corner of Sixth and Brandon street in Arroyo, Santo Domingo.[N 1] She also informs V that the client wants to be present when his wife's murderer is neutralized by the mercenary.
After making their way to the meeting location, V waits for Jablonsky's arrival. V gets up from the bench and approached Bill, and talks to them. During the conversation, Bill reveals to V that he wants them to kill Joshua Stephenson, a notorious murderer, and instructs V to get in the driver's seat of his truck.
Inside the truck, Bill tells V that Stephenson is the one who murdered his wife, and that despite his conviction, he managed to get out of jail due to corporate involvement.[N 2] He also tells V that Stephenson is being transported out of the Night City Prison and is accompanied by other ""regular"" individuals. As the NCPD SUV passes by, Jablonsky instructs V to follow the SUV.[N 3]
If V successfully followed the SUV:
Despite the traffic hurdles, V and Jablonsky managed to follow the van transporting Stephenson up-to an underpass, where the van ran into a stationary semi-truck. After stopping the truck, Jablonsky and V both get out. Jablonsky–overcome with anger and his desire to kill Stephenson himself–pulls out his pistol and rushes over to the SUV but is shot by NCPD Lieutenant Vasquez.
If V talks to Joshua Stephenson:
After Vasquez shoots Bill, Stephenson urges Vasquez to keep V alive, and threatens to kill the deal with the corporation if V is shot. As Vasquez stands down, he contacts the NCPD about the incident, and allows V to speak with Joshua Stephenson, who wants V to tag along with them.[N 4]
Stephenson will introduce himself to V, and ask their name and their associates name. As Vasquez concludes his call to the NCPD, he makes a remark about having heard of V, and urging to Stephenson that V is too big a threat to take along with them.
If V goes with Stephenson:
V accepts Joshua's invite and gets inside the NCPD SUV, and Vasquez will proceed to drive them to their destination while Joshua and V talk.[N 5]
If V declines to go with Stephenson:
V declines Joshua's invite to tag along with them. The three get back into the SUV and continue their journey, while V stayed behind, concluding the job.
If V neutralizes Joshua Stephenson:
After Jablonsky gets shot by Vasquez, V engaged Stephenson and neutralized them. Afterwards, V called Wakako Okada, and tells her that they were able to neutralize Joshua Stephenson. Wakako Okada rewarded V with a payment of 9,300 eurodollars for completing the job.[N 6][N 7]
If V fails to follow the SUV:
V failed to follow the van and bring Joshua Stephenson to justice, too much annoyance of Bill Jablonsky, he will proceed to terminate the gig and be angry with V, demanding they exit the vehicle. After a while, Bill will send V and angry text informing V that they will not be receiving any payment.","Talk to Wakako Okada.

The_Prophet%27s_Song,Phantom_Liberty,"V meets Garry the Prophet right outside Misty's Esoterica in Urmland Street. He has have five separate ramblings that V listens to and engages in a conversation with him on.[N 1]
During the last rambling where Garry is talking about nomads, two Aldecaldos approach and take issue with Garry calling them werewolves.
If V is a Nomad or completed Queen of the Highway prior to the final rambling, and chooses to acknowledge the Aldecados as allies:
V gets them to walk away without any fighting.
If V is not a Nomad or has not completed Queen of the Highway prior to the final rambling, or chooses not to acknowledge them as allies:
V helps Garry fight the Aldecados off.
Once done, Garry tells V about having heard that a mysterious meeting would take place somewhere in Kabuki.
Once at the marked location, Johnny talks with V, then both head over to the hiding spot marked by the quest and wait.[T 2] After some time passes, a group of Maelstrom gang members show up and talk to two corpos named Jane and John Doe before handing over a mysterious chip.[N 2][N 3]
If V prevents the corpos from leaving:
V obtains the Mysterious Chip off of Jane Doe's corpse, and returns to Garry the Prophet.[N 4] However, once V gets to his usual spot, Garry is nowhere to be found, replaced by his disciple who informs V he was taken away.[N 5]
If V donated enough to Garry earlier:
V can ask them about the chip and they will tell you what they know.
If V didn't donate enough earlier:
V can donate to them now to get them to talk.
If V lets the corpos escape:

The_Highwayman,Phantom_Liberty,"To begin this side job, first, head over to Woodhaven Street in Rancho Coronado East and travel up the street to the Gun-O-Rama gun shop. Around the back you'll find an accessible garage with a decal of a ghost horse to the left of it.
Alternatively, the quest can be started by finding Josie's body and reading the shard, ""Bad news"". In this case, the first objective will be to find the garage.
Once inside, V and Johnny will comment on the scrapped Brennan found inside. To officially start the side job, access the terminal on the opposite side of the garage. After reading the data stored, exit the terminal and V will pick up the photo of James Ito and Josie Alcazar resting next to it. This prompts V and Johnny to look for James to find out more about their situation.
To find James, travel to Japantown West and head south along the waterfront four lane road. There will be a plaza on the east side of the road after Holly Street with a 24/7 stand. James is sitting on the same bench in the photo, in front of the 24/7 stand. Talking to him will begin your investigation into what happened to Josie.
James and Josie's bench in front of the 24/7 stand
To find out what happened to Josie, head to Metro: Ebunike on the map. From the metro, with your scanner active, you will pick up a dried blood splatter on the ground. Following the blood splatters, past the Drop Point, on your right is an alleyway; and behind a dumpster, Josie's body.
There will be a shard labelled ""Bad news"" which details Josie's cause of death as well as information on the location of the bike she stole from a Tyger Claw boss. After having an exchange with Johnny, it's time to return to James in Japantown and confront him about what you've discovered. What happens to James after confronting him is up to you. After the confrontation, you will need to find the Tyger Claw boss's bike in order to complete the job.
The shard found on Josie's body mentions it being stowed on Maelstrom turf by All Foods. This will send you to the All Foods Factory in the Northside of Watson. Across street from the travel point, you'll see the ""ghost horse"" that Josie also mentioned in the shard. The bike is in the nearby garage. Punch in the date that James and Josie met (0214) into the keypad next to the garage and it will open.

If V is spotted by any cameras while escorting Myers through the subway tunnels, there is a laptop in a room at the end of the righthand route that can be used to wipe the camera recordings.
If one does not wipe the recordings, a group of Barghest soldiers will ambush V and Reed on their drive back to the hideout, with more at the building's lobby upon arrival. If Jacob and Taylor were convinced to help shelter Myers, they will be found dead.
If you kill Jacob and Taylor, you'll need to pick up one of the bodies, whereby a minor time skip follows with the bodies being disposed.
If you spare them, once you manage to enlist Reed for help, they'll be killed off later.
The telephone in the restaurant can have different numbers dialed in, which will make different sounds play through the phone and even elicit reactions from Johnny.

Love_Like_Fire,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Needs to be written from the character's perspective]
Following the events of The Heist, wherein V is killed by Dexter DeShawn, the former's brain is repaired by the biochip's nanites, and they begin to relive the memories contained on it, specifically those that occurred on August 20th, 2023.
Now in the perspective of Johnny Silverhand, the Rocker makes his way to The Hammer, where Kerry Eurodyne has already begun to perform due to the former being late. Johnny is accosted by the bouncer, who angrily pushes Silverhand aside. Johnny continues inside until he is on stage, where he states that he is saying goodbye to his fans.
Before Johnny makes his eventual exit, he is stopped by Kerry, who hopes to dissuade him from marching towards his eventual death. Johnny brushes this off and depending on player choice, tells Kerry to pursue his own career instead of living in Johnny's shadow, or insults him.
Outside, Johnny meets with Rogue Amendiares, and the two board a helicopter destined for Arasaka Towers along with Shaitan and Spider Murphy. Upon reaching Arasaka Tower's roof, Shaitan begins to open fire on soldiers before being shot. Johnny takes over and clears the rooftop of all hostiles, he quickly checks the payload, revealed to be a miniature nuclear device to be planted inside of the building.
Johnny, Rogue, and Spider fight their way through the tower until they reach an elevator, which Johnny to send the nuclear device inside further down. Rogue motions for them return to the rooftop to make their getaway, though Johnny protests, stating he had another objective in mind: uploading a virus into Arasaka's systems which would free Alt Cunningham. Rogue gives him four minutes to secure Alt and make for the helicopter.
Johnny makes his way to Kei Arasaka's office, fighting soldiers in the garden area, before eventually uploading the virus under the direction of Spider Murphy. After completion, Johnny attempts to leave before being ambushed by Adam Smasher and his team. From there, there is a gap in Johnny's memories during which he evidently escaped Smasher, meeting with Rogue on the rooftop. Johnny rushes to reach the already-ascending helicopter, briefly getting lifted by Rogue before they are hit by an explosion, causing Johnny to fall be left behind. Smasher appears and shoots a dying Johnny, causing his consciousness to fade. He briefly reawakens on a stretcher being carried off by Arasaka employees amidst the chaos. Johnny wakes again, this time to an interrogation by Arasaka agents. Johnny can either stay silent or toy with the interrogators.
The interrogation is joined Saburo Arasaka, who after a brief interrogation, orders Johnny to be subject to Soulkiller.","Go on stage.

Chippin%27_In_(quest),Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Further rewrite from V's perspective]
After Search and Destroy and another part of Tapeworm, Johnny will eventually ask to allow him to control your body so he can explain everything to Rogue to get her to help him take out Adam Smasher. V heads to the Afterlife and after talking with Johnny, takes the pill to surrender control to Johnny.
The events of the side quest A Cool Metal Fire take place.
V wakes up in a motel room, with Rogue Amendiares watching over them. She tells V that Johnny told her about Adam Smasher and then she leaves to gather more information about the Ebunike.
Ebunike[]
After about a day, Rogue calls and reveals that the Ebunike is an old container ship moored in Night City and ask V to meet with her back at the Afterlife to discuss further. Head over and after a short conversation with Crispin Weyland, follow Rogue out to her car where she'll give V a Replica of Johnny's Samurai jacket. They hop into Rogue's car and ride to the Ebunike Docks where the ship is.[N 1]
After spending some time to go over the plans and observing the location, Rogue and V enter the base and find a data term, which confirms that Grayson is currently aboard the ship. Rogue and V continue their path, and board the ship.
If V checks out the Kang Tao labelled crates on the Ebunike:
Rogue and V uncover that Adam Smasher was behind the Kang Tao raid reported some time ago. The crates contain firearms that were bound for South Africa.
If V checks out the body in one of the containers:
V finds a female body in one of the containers. The woman was strangled then shot point blank with hollow point rounds four days ago, as deduced by Rogue. According to Johnny, this is Adam Smasher's signature style.
If V checks out the audio recordings on the computer:
V can uncover that Adam Smasher was pulling the strings behind Militech backing out of a deal with Night Corp, as he was blackmailing Anthony Gilchrist by taking a woman by the name of Mallory hostage.
If V checks out the suspicious packages:
V finds some suspicious boxes labeled ""Tri-phet.""
After a short firefight with Grayson and his remaining goons, in which Grayson is defeated but not killed, he'll insinuate Rogue was actually on the same side as him at one point and there's more to the story on why she wasn't hunted down and killed after the Arasaka Tower bombing, but when V asks Rogue about this, she'll just note he's trying to distract V from their goal to find Smasher. Grayson will reveal that Adam Smasher is back in Japan, having been promoted to head of Arasaka's security, and thus unlikely to return to Night City. He tries to bargain his way into being spared, offering a special keepsake of Johnny's they can have if V lets him go.[N 2] After dealing with Grayson, Rogue becomes upset and V talks to her before her departing. Johnny suggests to give her a moment and let her cool down.
The Oilfields[]

V hops into a car and drives out to the Northern Oilfields to find Johnny's unmarked grave. At the supposed grave site, Johnny and V have a lengthy conversation, looking back on their adventure so far, and about what is still to come.

Raymond_Chandler_Evening,Phantom_Liberty,"This quest begins when you enter the Coyote Cojo. Two Valentinos, Juan and Pedro, will be harassing a drunk corpo, Joseph Odman, who is passed out at one of the tables. Pepe tells them to stop, and asks you to intervene. The Streetkid background has an additional dialogue option to convince them that Mama Welles wouldn't take kindly to blood in her bar.
After dealing with the gangoons, either by convincing them to back off or engaging in combat with them, the corpo will pay you for defending him before passing out again. Pepe offers you a free drink and a job: to find out with whom his wife is cheating on him. Leave the bar and head right (northeast) down the road; as soon as you leave the bar, Johnny begins his narration.
Identify Cynthia, but do not follow too close, as doing so will alert her and the quest will fail (15m will trigger a warning from Johnny). She will head down the road and enter a building where, upon entering, she can be heard arguing with a man. Confront Cynthia and the occupant, and you will have the option to say ""Doesn't matter. I've seen enough"", which ends the dialogue and quest.
Alternatively, you have the option to hear Cynthia out. She will reveal that the man is not a lover but her ripperdoc. She elaborates that her entire physical appearance is artificial, being the result of implants.
At this point, you must leave the building and call Pepe. There are two options: tell him the truth or that he must talk to Cynthia himself. If you tell the truth, Pepe will be shocked and upset over his wife lying to him for so long. You can either tell him that he has a right to feel cheated, or that Cynthia loves him and that he shouldn't give up on their marriage. Either way, Pepe will pay you and the quest will end.
If the player told Pepe to save their marriage, Cynthia will contact you by holo a day or two after the quest, thanking you and sending you another 2210€$ beyond the payment from Pepe. Otherwise, Cynthia will be disappointed in your actions, telling you that Pepe threw her out and she's now living on the streets.","Find out what's going on.

Spellbound,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Rewrite from V's perspective. Usage of {{Condition}}]
Upon approaching the Afterlife after being directed by Rogue to talk to Panam during Ghost Town or completing KOLD MIRAGE, Netrunner Nix messages V and asks them to stop by the Afterlife to discuss a job, which involves purchasing a rare ""The Book of Spells"" from the netrunner R3n0. As simple as the errand appears to be, Nix wants V to buy The Book of Spells in his stead just in case the exchange unexpectedly goes wrong, and he intends to compensate V for both the expense and the pickup. Nix sends R3n0's contact into to V. Call her to set up a meeting.
Travel to the restaurant Au Cabanon in Charter Hill, next to the Lele Park fast travel point. R3n0 is waiting by the bar with a laptop. At this point, V has two ways to get The Book of Spells. The first way is to speak with R3n0 and buy The Book of Spells for 5500 eurodollars, which concludes the deal without violence despite V's misgivings that R3n0 is a scammer. The second way is to avoid paying R3n0 at all by attacking her (scanning her laptop will also immediately turn her hostile), then jacking into her laptop after she is unconscious or dead. The Book of Spells's coordinates are in the laptop's messages, which also reveal how R3n0 came into possession of The Book of Spells: she is an employee of Hard Wire Ltd. named Clarity, and her boss asked her to review the data on an old cyberdeck that had been found in storage in one of their warehouses. Clarity could not get past The Book of Spells's malware, but recognized its value to a more skilled netrunner and decided to sell it without her boss's knowledge.
V is then directed to a shopping plaza across the street. Open the suitcase, tucked away next to a vending machine, to reveal The Book of Spells: a genuine Zetatech XPR tablet. Johnny Silverhand will comment that it was cutting edge tech back in 2020 and he used to own one. Take The Book of Spells. V can optionally crack The Book of Spells themselves before returning to Nix, which can potentially reward cash and some quickhacks.
Return to Nix to hand over The Book of Spells and receive payment. If V has high enough Intelligence, they can point out that The Book of Spells is worth much more than Nix is paying, and he will reluctantly give V a bonus.
Alternatively, V may access the ""Smuggler's Cache"" netpage after receiving Nix's message to see R3n0's post, which will change the objective to call R3n0. V will no longer be able to ask Nix what gig he is offering, and Nix will pretend he is not very interested in The Book of Spells and will not offer to compensate V for the price of purchasing it. But V will now have access to two Cool dialogue options to make Nix pay double or triple his original price. If V does not bargain with Nix, he will pay the same as if he had offered V the gig directly, but if he pays double he will offer 37.5% more and 75% more if he pays triple. V will still have access to the Intelligence option to point out The Book of Spells is worth more, in which case the cool dialogue options cannot be used.[verification needed]","Talk to Nix.

Gig:_MIA,Phantom_Liberty,"Mercenary Benedict McAdams was promised safe passage out of Night City by Dakota Smith after assassinating a corrupt Night City councilman for her, but his driver, Jason Wildriver, went off course and McAdams has gone missing. McAdams had the forethought to implant a GPS chip before taking on Dakota's job, and Dakota wants V to investigate his coordinates so she can provide him with a new driver.
McAdams is imprisoned in the basement of an Abandoned House in the Biotechnica Flats. It turns out that Jason Wildriver decided to sell the merc to Militech instead of taking him out of the city. The councilman whom McAdams killed had deep ties to Militech, and the corp wanted to cover up the corruption by scapegoating McAdams for the murder and a litany of other shady dealings. Wildriver jumped at the chance to line his pockets. As V arrives at Wildriver's hideout, they can overhear Wildriver on the phone with a Militech representative, threatening to kill McAdams unless the corp increases their payout.
The only enemy in the area is Wildriver, who can be found roaming the yard outside the house. He can be killed or incapacitated, or avoided by sneaking into the house. Be warned that multiple mines have been placed behind the house, and the front is guarded by a turret. There is also a surveillance camera in the basement where McAdams is located, but it can be deactivated using the computer inside the house.
Speak with McAdams. He explains what happened to him and agrees to follow V. If V did not bring a car, there is an Archer Quartz ""Sidewinder"" in the garage that they can take to drive McAdams to the rendezvous point. Starting the car will alert Wildriver if he has not already been eliminated, but he can be easily escaped.
At the rendezvous point, exit the car and wait for McAdams' new driver. McAdams recognizes him as Starkey, an old friend, and they drive away together. Dakota then sends V their payment.","Find Ben.

Shoot_To_Thrill,Phantom_Liberty,"You get a call from Robert Wilson, the owner of the local 2nd Amendment in your megabuilding. He is hosting a shooting competition to drum up some local business. You arrive with five other competitors, although one is kicked out after breaking Wilson's pistol only rule.
Once the competition starts, your objective is simple. Hit as many targets as many times you are able to within the time limit. So it is advised to use a pistol that has a high-rate of fire and a large magazine. You are not restricted to the target in your lane, so make advantage of the fact that you are able to shoot the targets in other lanes.
If V wins the shooting competition:
Robert will give you a Lexington x-MOD2, and some eddies.
If V loses the shooting competition:
If you lose, the winner will complain that the weapon they've won is of low quality.
If you have enough points in Reflexes, Wilson can be asked about his situation, where he will lament that business is down and considers the shooting competition a failure as it did nothing to help boost sales in his shop. Otherwise, V can say their goodbyes to end the quest.","Go to Wilson's shooting range.

Dream_On,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: none given]
Some time after investigating Lucius Rhyne's murder, V will receive a call from Jefferson Peralez requesting that he investigates another case for him and his wife.
At the Peralez apartment in Charter Hill, Westbrook, Elizabeth will guide V to the living room. There, the waiting Jefferson explains that he witnessed an intruder in their apartment several nights ago. Jefferson recalls shooting the man but losing consciousness shortly thereafter. Oddly, their private security, SSI, denies that any incident occurred. After the talking, Jefferson leaves the apartment for an election meeting, leaving Elizabeth to help V check the clues.
Elizabeth will begin with a brief tour of the apartment, but will soon let V to freely explore. During the investigation, V can explore the apartment and scan certain objects to ask Elizabeth for some information, such as their diplomas from Asukaga-Berkeley Law School, their wedding photo, their family's photo etc. During these investigations, V will likely soon notice that Elizabeth's memory is chaotic. For example, Elizabeth says her husband has never smoked, but V has previously seen Jefferson smoking; Elizabeth says the roses during the wedding are blue, but they are actually red in the wedding photo. V can also read a message about Jefferson's failing memory on one of the computers. Moreover, checking the computers in the control room downstairs reveals that SSI security are actually aware and complicit in the ongoing events.
Scanning the corridor upstairs will reveal patched bullet holes in the wall and chemically scrubbed residues of blood, which you should follow. Along the way, you will find a broken screen of smart glass, which you can attempt to repair with sufficient Technical Ability. Touching the screen this way triggers a shock that affects both V and Johnny, although Elizabeth notices nothing during the event. Eventually, the trail will lead to a wall that you can scan to find a hidden door. V can gain entry to this hidden room by force (requires 9 Body), via the computer in the control room (use the code 6709, which can be found in an adjacent computer station, or by hacking the station), or through a hatch on the roof of the building. Regardless, V will find a secret monitoring station, whereby Elizabeth and Jefferson were being observed without their knowledge. Elizabeth will be shocked and presently feels head discomfort, leaving V to continue the investigation alone. Scan the strange computer in the room, which will prompt V to follow the cables trailing upwards.
The nearby ladder leads to the roof of the building, where there is an old-fashioned transmitter, which Johnny notes resembles those used by Militech during the Second Central American War. Because such antennae rely on line-of-sight, V can find a distant van near another antenna. After finding it, V can return to Elizabeth and tell her about the transmitter, before leaving the apartment to find the van. Upon doing so, Johnny will suggest that V goes on wheels rather than on foot.
The vehicle in question is parked in the Japantown sub-district of Westbrook. Upon approaching, it will be revealed as a heavily modified Emperor 620 Ragnar, which will begin driving away, requiring V to pursui.
If V loses the van:
V calls Elizabeth, explaining the situation as the mercenary was unable to find who was behind the spying. She is disappointed, but will tell her husband about potentially investigating Holt. Elizabeth pays V and the mission ends.
The Ragnar will enter Northside and eventually go to a Maelstrom compound near the All Foods Factory. V's goal is to connect to the access point on the vehicle. One can sneak in by climbing to the roof using scaffolds in an alley to the right, but after going into the building. On one of the agents, V can find an encrypted shard regarding Project Condin.
Accessing the vehicle's database will uncover evidence that a shadowy organization is manipulating the brains of Jefferson, Elizabeth, and others to modify personalities and behavior. This process has already caused severe memory loss to both Jefferson and Elizabeth. Johnny suggests downloading the data, but after doing so, the data is deleted by someone. After the investigation, V must call Elizabeth and apprise her of the situation. She will ask the merc meets with her in person before doing anything else.
Elizabeth can be found at a ramen shop in Yagami Market. There, she will explain that she has already noticed Jefferson's changing personality, and she fears that she is also changing. Knowing her husband and fearing the consequences of his reaction, Elizabeth will implore V not to reveal the truth to Jefferson.
Jefferson will be waiting for V in Reconciliation Park in The Glen. When nearing the meeting location, V's optics will be spiked and they will receive a call from an unknown individual, who warns them not to cross the line by revealing to Jefferson what they have learned.
In the meeting location, Jefferson asks V about the investigation result, who can choose to tell Jefferson the truth about the brainwashing or lie and omit the information.
If V tells the truth to Jefferson:
Jefferson is shocked by the terrifying truth, and also angry at Elizabeth about lying to him. He will decide to play along with his manipulators' plans until he sees an opportunity to expose them but potentially risking his life and the lives of his family.
If V follows Elizabeth's words:
V tells Jefferson that there is no news and the SSI had been receiving money from Weldon Holt among many other clients. Jefferson will decide to win the election first, and then deal with Holt.","Go to the Peralezes' apartment.

The Ho-Oh club on Allen St. is where V needs to go in order to find Jotaro Shobo. Jotaro will be guarded by a good number of Tyger Claws on all three floors of Ho-Oh that V will either have to sneak past or fight through to get to the top floor, where Jotaro is. Aside from the Tyger Claws and Jotaro himself, there is also a turret on the third floor, which is by far the deadliest enemy that will have to be dealt with in this gig, either destroying it or using quickhacks to shut it down.
After getting to Jotaro, there are two choices in how to deal with him. V can either kill him, which ends the gig and just requires them to leave the club premises afterward, or neutralize him with a non-lethal takedown. Handling Jotaro non-lethally will yield an extra objective, which is to carry him out of Ho-Oh and deliver him to a fixer's vehicle so that he can be taken to the Mox to be dealt with.

After replying to the text, Muamar sends V the coordinates of the vehicle last known location, the abandoned parking lot on the outskirts of Arroyo, Santo Domingo.
Once arrived at the scene, there is no sign of the car. Only the body of a man can be found. As you approach the body, Johnny Silverhand will appear and comment on the appearance of the man, as it appears to be an impersonator by the name of Johnny Silverman.

Several weeks have passed after the raid on Arasaka Tower[N 1], and V wakes up in Panam Palmer's Warhorse at the Coronado Dam overlooking Night City. Panam and V talk about how far they've come since they met, which is interrupted by V coughing up blood- a sign of their worsening condition; as well as their plans to leave Night City with the rest of the Aldecaldos to head for Arizona, along with all the plundered loot they've stolen from the corporation and discuss plans to use their connections to try and save V's life.
After talking, Panam heads back to her car, telling V to take their time looking at the city one more time before they get in the car and head to meet up with the others. As they ride to the Solar Arrays in Jackson Plains, they are joined by Mitch Anderson, who playfully teases Panam about the upcoming sandstorm as they drive to the meeting point.
Once arrived at the Solar Arrays, V talks with the other Aldecaldos–Cassidy Righter and Carol Emeka–before rejoining Mitch and Panam, who discuss using a famous Aldecaldo Tunnel to evade both Arasaka, who'll be looking for their stolen tech at every checkpoint, and Border Patrol, who'll want to stop any trespassers who try to jump the Border Crossing.[N 2]
If V has high enough Body:
V inquires Panam and Mitch about the possible security measures that the SoCal Border Patrol will have on the way to the tunnel, which Panam will respond by telling V to not worry, explaining that they'll know what to do, as well as mentioning that Cassidy and Carol will also help distract Arasaka from ever finding them.
Mitch and Panam tell V that after they escape through the tunnel, they'll collapse it to prevent anyone from following them, then making their way towards the meeting point with the rest of the Aldecaldos, then altogether moving towards Tuscon. Panam reassures V, telling them they won't be alone anymore starting today.
Boarding the Basilisk, the group charge across the Badlands and against the upcoming sandstorm, with V and Panam following them not far behind as they use it as cover to escape the Border Patrol drones, with Cassidy and Carol breaking off to distract them as planned, wishing them good luck. Heading to the tunnel entrance, V hands the controls to Panam, who use the modded Turbothrusters to ram through and into the tunnel, before making their way out the other side.
Having left Night City, the following ending cinematic will play where V will get out of the Basilisk to sit back and take in the night air as it hovers across the open water.

Killing_In_The_Name,Phantom_Liberty,"Some time after after dealing with the Voodoo Boys, V will be sent a message to check their personal computer in their apartment regarding the Bartmoss Collective. After heading up to their apartment and checking out Nancy's post on the Bartmoss website, V give Bess a call.[N 1]
After contacting Nancy on the holo, V is directed towards the source of a signal coming from an apartment building on an unnamed street in Rancho Coronado, Santo Domingo.[N 2] After hacking the device, V receives a message from an unknown sender, directing V to another location in the Badlands.
V navigates to the second location in the Jackson Plains. They find another router can be found atop a trailer, which is guarded by Wraiths. After hacking this router, they will receive another message directing them to a third location.
They navigate to the third location in the Biotechnica Flats. They find another router at the top of one of the large Biotechnica installations. Once again, after hacking the router, they are sent a text message directing them to a fourth location.
V navigates to the fourth location at the West Wind Estates in Pacifica. They find a router next to a hacked Fortune Teller Machine, which appears to be the original source of the signal.[N 3]
If V decides to keep the Fortune Teller:
The fortune teller will remain active, and will keep misleading people on the net by spreading rumors and citations, satisfying Johnny in the process.
If V decides to hack the Fortune Teller:
V is able to choose to either disable the fortune teller machine or to hack the machine.
If V decides to disable the Fortune Teller:

For the quest to appear V needs to either leave the biomonitor at the drop point or destroy it during the last conversation with the agents in Gig: Spy in the Jungle.
V receives a message from Steven Santos, asking to meet. He will be waiting for V at the docks in Wellsprings. He will give V 3,000 eurodollars and share a few updates: that his career is progressing, Ana has been fired, and the SovOil deal is progressing as hoped.","Meet with Steven.

The_Nomad,Phantom_Liberty,"V starts in a mechanic's garage in the small town of Yucca, just southwest of the SoCal Border Crossing to Night City. While looking into a mirror, V removes the patch of their old nomad clan. While V is removing the patch, a mechanic is trying to repair their car, but needs a part that he doesn't have in stock. V turns to face the mechanic, and moves the mechanic out of the way. They make a short-term workaround that should last long enough to reach Night City. V leaves the garage, but before they can continue, V is hassled by the local sheriff, who asks pointed questions about their presence in his town and makes it clear that nomads, with or without a clan, are unwelcome.
V needs to meet up with their contact, Jackie Welles, to pick up the package they will both be smuggling into Night City. V slips past the patrolling sheriff, and heads south, towards the radio tower. At the radio tower, V climbs the radio tower and contacts Willie McCoy to receive Jackie's location, which turns out to be an abandoned farm close to the border. V drives to the abandoned farm. After making introductions, Jackie retrieves the package and places it in the trunk of V's car, and they both head out towards the border crossing.
At the Border Crossing, V and Jackie are stopped by the border guards and ordered to report for an inspection. V tells Jackie to stay with the car, and they enter the Border Crossing building. V steps into the room with the papers declaring their cargo to be ""lost on arrival"" - along with a sufficient bribe to ""encourage"" the guards not to look too closely. The guard accepts the bribe, but V gets a bad feeling that the guard knows more than he is letting on. V returns to their car, where they have Jackie take the wheel and get out of there as soon as possible; as they think something is definitely going on and V doesn't want to stick around. As they leave the crossing, V and Jackie are cut off by Arasaka security, who demands that they halt and hand over the corporate property that they are smuggling, revealing that they were set up. V tells Jackie to gun it, and lead the security team on a chase through the Biotechnica Protein Farm on the city's outskirts, eventually shaking them successfully and hiding in a nearby garage, where V's car finally breaks down for good. Inside the garage, V opens up the package to see what caused all the trouble: a genuine, live iguana. After discussing what to do next, Jackie, deciding he likes V, offers his hand and friendship and partnership as the iguana looks on, leading into the Night City introduction montage.","Talk to the mechanic.

As V follows the drone, they will tell V that they are aware that customer services is at an unsatisfactory level at the moment, and that they want to give V a full factory tour as additional compensation.
As V and Delamain tour the factory, Delamain tells V that they are interested in expanding their business by offering repair services in the future, but explains that the expansion will have to wait as the shop is currently overwhelmed with work due to the vehicle failures, of which V was one of the victims. Delamain theorizes that it is due to a virus infecting the Delamain network, but is unable to find the cause as of yet. Because of the current crisis, Delamain is worried that the costs will eventually grow too high, and that it will attract unwanted attention to the company.
As Delamain and V enter the control room, Delamain asks V if they want to help them recover the vehicles that are still missing. Delamain explains to V that NetWatch is already starting to poke around, and is worried that Netwatch may try to recategorize him as a rogue AI from beyond the Blackwall.
V agrees to help, and Delamain gives them the coordinates of the last known locations of the seven missing vehicles and a scanning device, so that Delamain can reestablish a connection with the vehicles once they are within range and make them return to the headquarters.

Gig:_Psychofan,Phantom_Liberty,"V is tasked by Sebastian Ibarra to steal a guitar belonging to former Samurai member Kerry Eurodyne, which came in the possession of Gaston Slayton, a Samurai superfan.
When V enters the apartment building on Los Lobos Street and takes the elevator up to the 17th floor, there are two ways to break into Gaston Slayton's apartment. The first is to simply break in through the front door, which requires a high level of Technical Ability. Otherwise, you must access the apartment via the balcony, which involves getting to the roof. To do so, go to the fire exit at the right of the apartment door and go up the stairs until you reach the apartment roof. From there, go straight ahead to the edge of the building, where you will see the apartment's balcony below you. Disable or note the security camera before dropping to the balcony below, where you can enter an unlocked door to the apartment.
While inside the apartment, V can freely explore his surroundings without the risk of being caught, noticing various Samurai concert posters and vintage guitars, although Johnny Silverhand will call them ""hot trash"". Proceeding upstairs will take V to Slayton's bedroom along with a suitcase containing the Iconic item ""Johnny's pants"", and a shrine room containing Kerry's guitar. the door to the shrine is protected by a keypad, the code for which can be found on a still with the guitar in it with the date ""2065"". Simply enter the code (or force the door open with a Body attribute check), take the guitar. There is a computer in the bedroom locked via a keycode; although it doesn't unlock from the same code, entering the code into the door panel also appears to unlock the computer to check the messages showing Gaston wanted to get surgery to look like Johnny's band mate Kerry. V can also jack into the computer to get additional information. Exit the apartment building and head to Drop Point to deposit the guitar, completing the gig.","Get inside the building.

Talkin%27_%27bout_a_Revolution,Phantom_Liberty,"About a day after Judy Álvarez and V met with Maiko Maeda at Clouds, Judy will text V that she is still working on a plan and that it will probably take a couple more days to finalize the details.
After some time passes, Judy will call V and tell them that she's devised a plan to take over Clouds, and invites V over to her apartment in the evening to discuss the plan in detail, with Tom Caldera and Roxanne Sumner–two dolls that work at Clouds, and Maiko Maeda, whom she managed to convince. She also asks V what they would prefer to have on their pizza. V, curious about this secret plan of Judy, asks her if she is privy to share more details now, to which Judy reveals that she managed to tweak the doll behavioral chips and how to turn them into fighter chips, but will go into more detail during the meeting.
After arriving at the apartment building on Charters street in Northside, V uses the intercom to let Judy know that they are there. V is promptly greeted by Tom, who tells them that their pizza is getting cold. As V enters and follows Tom to the kitchen, Judy greets V and introduces them to Roxanne, and tells them that she is one of the longest working dolls at Clouds. V sits down on the stool and talks with the others until Maiko–who apparently was in the bathroom–comes out to join in and makes a snide remark about the fact that Evelyn died in Judy's bathroom.
If V talks with Maiko Maeda and has killed Woodman:
This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝
V talks with Maiko before talking with Judy. Maiko questions V about what happened to Oswald Forrest as he hasn't been to work in a few days, which V will happily explain to her.
V asks Judy what the plan is about, which Judy will explain in detail. She managed to modify the doll behavioral chips, and equip them with an advanced motor reflex system, that gives the doll enhanced combat abilities that could match a Solo. Judy will inform V that Tom already has the modified doll chip, and the chip's impulses replace ones natural reflexes, and makes the user feel like as if they were experiencing cyberpsychosis. Tom adds that it is basically the same as if he would activate his behavioral chip for a client.
If V has high enough Reflexes:
V asks about the possible side-effects of the behavioral chip, which Judy answers with that once a threat has been detected, the chip will automatically activate, and that she currently has not found a workaround for it, as it would require months of testing, which is time she doesn't have. Roxanne adds that there is an ethical side to the use of the chip, as you could murder someone and not remember doing so.
If V has high enough Body:
V tells them that being a Solo requires more than just executing a series of movements, and that it requires years of experience in the field to become a good Solo. Judy says that V is probably right, but that they do not have the time for years of intensive training.
If V asks Judy how she came up with the idea:
Judy explains that she learned how to adjust behavioral chips while she was working at Clouds, and given that how easy it was, the idea didn't jump into her mind as soon as they met with Maiko earlier. Maiko adds that due to all the surveillance at Clouds, this would probably never have happened during Judy's time there, as the Tyger Claws would have taken measures to prevent it from happening.
V wants to see how the modified behavioral chip works, asks for a demonstration. Tom will proceed to throw three kitchen knives at the wall in rapid succession. Unconvinced by Tom's display, V proceeds to ask for a one-on-one sparring duel with Tom, who proceeds to grab V arm and pushes them on Judy's couch.[N 1]
As V lands on the couch, Judy rushes over to them to make sure they are okay. Judy tells V that after they've taken over Clouds successfully, the chips will get neutralized so that they cannot be used again.[N 2]
Judy then reveals once they take over Clouds, the bosses will be given an ultimatum to take a cut of the proceeds to never show up at the club again, giving the dolls control of the place, but Maiko points out an obvious flaw: the Tyger Claws will just send more security in to regain control. She instead tells V that they need to go after Hiromi Sato–Clouds real owner–and humiliate him in front of the rest of the gang's bosses to remove him. Maiko will then suggest that they instead follow a two-pronged assault strategy, with Tom and Roxanne infiltrating the joyhouse and V infiltrating Hiromi's apartment.
If V decides to go forward with the plan:
V agrees to go forward with the plan. Maiko leaves with Tom and Roxanne in tow, whom ask her for a ride. V stays a little while longer at Judy's place to talk a little bit longer with Judy to discuss pay. As V stands up, they suffer another Relic malfunction, and sit back on Judy's couch with her help.
If V decides to tell Judy about the Relic:
V tells Judy about the Relic and what it is doing to them, and that they can only hope to find a cure.
Judy offers V to stay at her place for a little while longer, so that they can recover.
If V decides to stay:
V decides to stay over at Judy's place, and sleeps on the couch. In the morning, Judy texts them that they've gone out already, but left them breakfast on the kitchen counter.[N 3]

As V puts on the Braindance Wreath and slots in the braindance, they experience the death of cyberpsycho Lt. Col. James Norris and receive a warning about the fate of David Martinez.
After the braindance ends, V finds themselves on the ground. They text Muamar Reyes to inquire about David Martinez. Muamar relates some of David's story, and promises to be in touch when he has found out more about the whereabouts of his companions.
After about 24 in-game hours, V receives a text message from Falco. In it, Falco will explain that he used to run with David, although they have fallen out of the spotlight.

When V nears Megabuilding H6, Muamar Reyes will call with a job to sabotage a 6th Street hideout responsible for jumping a Militech transport in the area. He tasks V to infect their systems with a virus, and to kill Lucius Thoran, the Techie behind the 6th Street plans.
Follow the objective marker to the elevator of Megabuilding H6 and ascend to the 19th floor. This entire floor is a hostile area occupied by 6th Street gangers. Two will be waiting outside the elevator with their backs to you.
The computer you need to access is on the highest floor of the hideout, directly across the megabuilding from you, and your optional target, Lucius Thoran is in the same room. There is a stealth route through the abandoned rooms to your right (requires Body and Technical Ability).
Once you have completed your objectives, leave the hideout and return via the elevator. Some hostile 6th Street gangers may be waiting for you outside. After Muamar calls you, go to the drop point at the bottom of the building to complete this gig.","Enter the megabuilding.

Gig:_Flying_Drugs,Phantom_Liberty,"You are contracted to investigate the cause of the disappearance of a smuggler's drones, and is directed to Union Railroad, an old railway station that is occupied by the Wraiths. The station is heavily guarded, with Wraiths both inside and outside the station's main building, automated turrets guarding the gateways, and cameras watching most of the grounds. Arriving at the station will prompt V to figure out how the drones are being intercepted, which can be done in two different ways.
The first method requires an Intelligence rank of 7. Enter the building, look for a computer on the ground floor, and pass the Intelligence skill check to hack it. Once hacked, go to the messages tab to discover the rooftop transmission antenna has been reprogrammed to broadcast a virus that disables the propulsion systems of drones that come within range, allowing the Wraiths to steal their cargo. V is directed to the roof to disable the antenna.
The second method is to ignore the computer and proceed straight to the roof to examine the antenna. Johnny Silverhand will appear and point out that the antenna is obviously being used to down the drones.
Disabling the antenna can be achieved by either destroying it with a weapon, which will alert any remaining guards and security systems on the premises, or by having a Technical Ability rank of 10, which lets V cut the antenna's power and stay undetected. Lastly, leave the area to complete the gig.
There is an alternative way to complete the gig. As a netrunner, it is possible to destroy the antenna without ever entering the compound:
Use a Tier 5 Ping on one of the guards and wait for the antenna to be highlighted, or
Take control of the surveillance camera at the very top of the tower, which will give a direct view of the antenna.
Hack the antenna with an Initiate Overload command to destroy it. Dakota will have a unique line if the antenna is destroyed in this manner.","Go to the signal source.

If V refuses the first time:
V says they currently don't have time to come, which will cause Joshua to plead with V over the phone, claiming that they need V to be present during recording. Rachel tells V that they'll receive extra compensation for their time.
If V refuses again:
V apologizes and tells them that they are on their own.[N 1]
If V agrees:
V agrees to help out and heads to Fourth Wall Studios, where there's a group of people protesting against ""The Passion of Joshua""'s filming.[T 2] As V approaches the gate, they are hailed by Vasquez, who tells V that Rachel has been waiting for them, and instructs V to go to the building down the street with the NCPD Officer out front. After the Officer lets V inside, they talk to Rachel, who instructs them to talk to Joshua in the dressing room.
V approaches Joshua, and sits down on the stool in front of him. Joshua tells V that he is having second thoughts about recording the braindance and asks for V's opinion.[N 2] Eventually, Joshua will ask V to join him in prayer.
If V agrees, and lets him pray:
V and Joshua clasp their hands, and Joshua will recite Saint Augustine's Prayer to the Holy Spirit.
""Breathe in me O Holy Spirit, that my thoughts may all be holy.""
""Act in me O Holy Spirit, that my work, too, may be holy.""
""Draw my heart O Holy Spirit, that I love but what is holy.""
""Strengthen me O Holy Spirit, to defend all that is holy.""
""Guard me, then, O Holy Spirit, that I always may be holy. Amen.""
If V clasps hands with Joshua, and does the praying:
V and Joshua clasp their hands, and V recites a prayer.[N 3]
If V doesn't want to pray:
V refuses to join Joshua in prayer, making Joshua pray silently on his own.
A moment later, Rachel enters backstage and interrupts Joshua and V, stating that the time has come to record the braindance. Joshua asks V if they want to perform his crucifixion.
If V agrees to crucify Joshua:
V accepts to crucify Joshua. After picking up the hammer, and waiting for everyone to be in position, V nails Joshua's wrists and feet to the cross while reciting the lines from the teleprompter.[N 4][N 5]
If V does not quit during the recording:
V presses the button to raise the cross, and waits for Joshua to pass.[N 6]
If V quits at any point during the recording:
V says that they are unable to continue with nailing Joshua to the cross, and another actor continues to fulfill the role instead. The actor presses the button and raises the cross, as V waits for Joshua to pass.[N 6]
Afterwards, V talks with Rachel, who will tell V that they'll reach out to V at a later point for their payment.
If V refuses to crucify Joshua, but agrees to stay:
V refuses to perform Joshua's crucifixion, and witnesses another actor fulfill the role instead.[N 4] After the crucifixion is finished and the cross is raised, V waits until Joshua has passed.[N 6] Before leaving, V talks with Rachel, who will tell V that they'll reach out to V at a later point for their payment.

Gig:_Hot_Merchandise,Phantom_Liberty,"This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝Reason: Conditional statements
Rogue contacts V with a gig that she presents as a necessary evil. Either disrupt an otherwise respectable small business, or risk Militech cracking down on the city to stem the tide of jailbroken and untraceable weapons bearing their manufacturer's mark. The contract is for the former outcome.
V may either enter the Data Inc. store normally, through a set of industrial shutters in the alleyway south of the storefront, or circle around to the west of the store to attempt either a Technical Ability check on the rear door's lock or a Body check to force open the garage door.
If V enters via the storefront:
V can pose as a customer and even shop at the store without raising suspicion. The item selection is typical of a junk vendor, although sold at a significant markup by the surly and abnormally muscular salesperson. No weapons are available to buy even if V hints to the vendor that they are aware of the store's ""high end"" inventory. A gangoon will be arguing with the back-room staff about exactly this when V enters, but he leaves shortly after expressing his disappointment.
If V attacks the employees or is caught trespassing:
The customer puts aside his complaints and defends the store. If the employees are alerted after the gangoon leaves, he will also be alerted, although he's going to be too far away to provide much immediate help.
If V enters any other way, or tries to get behind the counter:
Attempting to get into an employee-only area will make the Animals posing as legitimate businessmen attack V on sight. If V opens the rear garage door, Rebeca will use her Netrunner skills to immediately start tracing V's location - presuming that the Animal in the back of the store doesn't see V as soon as the door opens.
Rebeca and a final guard can be found downstairs in a netrunning den. The last guard can be overheard on a holocall complaining to a friend that he's missing leg day because he has to ""make sure [Rebeca] doesn't starve,"" provided he hasn't been alerted. Rebeca herself is out of her netrunning chair working on computers. A data shard in her inventory will reveal that she's in this business under duress rather than her own initiative, as Rogue had assumed. She will turn hostile if she spots V regardless; it seems that she has too much to lose.
If Rebeca is killed:
Rogue expresses no remorse if Rebeca is killed. In her mind, this was about maintaining equilibrium and nothing more.
If Rebeca is knocked unconscious and delivered to Rogue:
Rogue's tone is slightly more congratulatory. Incidentally, the quickest way to the fixer's transport is through the one-way door at the south end of the netrunning den.
Rogue does not remark on Rebeca's motivations in either outcome.","Enter the electronics store.

Upon agreeing to help, Mitch asks V if they can drive his car and follow him, while he drives in Scorpion's car to one of Scorpion's favorite spots.
Arriving at the spot—a collapsed bridge that borders the ravine of the northern Badlands—Mitch reveals that Scorpion's body is in the trunk of the car. V, freaked out by this, asks what Mitch is doing, who responds that Scorpion's final wish was to ""sent off with a bang.""
Mitch instructs V to grab a nearby gas canister filled with CHOOH2 and place it in the passenger seat of the car, as Mitch places Scorpion's body in the driver's seat. After that, Mitch asks V to light the rag he put in the car's gas tank on fire, while he starts the car remotely.
V and Mitch watch on as the car rides off the ramp into the ravine and explodes. Mitch explains to V that it felt right to include them as they are still alive because of them, and gives them Scorpion's Stinger and his beloved good luck charm, an Action Figure, as thanks.[N 3]","Talk to Mitch.

Gig:_Big_Pete%27s_Got_Big_Problems,Phantom_Liberty,"This is an assassination gig and the target is Big Pete, a techie who works with the Wraiths. He can be found working in the basement of the New American Autoworks garage in the southern Badlands, which is guarded by two turrets (both facing the main road), six cameras (four external, two interior), and a total of nine Wraiths gang members (five exterior, four interior). Combat will finish the gig quickly, but stealth is also possible as long as the interior cameras and enemies are dealt with quietly.
However the enemies and defenses are handled, look for the door into the basement on the left side of the garage's interior. Upon entering the basement, Big Pete immediately notices V and pleads for mercy, explaining that the only reason he has a price on his head is because he sold a faulty signal jammer. In exchange for lying about killing him so he can escape with his life, Big Pete offers to double V's payout for the hit. If V perused one of the computers in the garage and read about Big Pete begging his brother, Tiny Mike, for money, they can point out that Big Pete is broke, but he will claim that this is no longer the case.
Once Big Pete is dealt with, V can use a utility tunnel that is only accessible from the basement as an alternate way to leave the area. The tunnel exits behind a communications tower behind the garage, out of view of any enemies or surveillance devices.
If V spares Big Pete and accepts his bribe:
Big Pete wires V the eurodollars and promises to leave Night City forever. Dakota Smith is surprised that V let the target go, but closes the contract since the problem has been solved.

Beat_on_the_Brat,Phantom_Liberty,"Preliminaries[]
After the initial fight with the training robot, it acts as a tracker for the following side jobs:
Beat on the Brat: Arroyo
Beat on the Brat: Kabuki
Beat on the Brat: Rancho Coronado
Beat on the Brat: The Glen
Only the Kabuki fight can be done during Act 1, as the rest of the locations are inaccessible until Act 2 due to Watson being under NCPD lockdown. Completing all four fights will unlock the championship fight against professional boxer Razor Hugh. To unlock this final fight, you must first complete Transmission.
If V has completed the side job Send in the Clowns—which unlocks after completing the main job Transmission—an optional fifth preliminary fight will be unlocked:
Beat on the Brat: Pacifica
Razor Hugh[]
The championship fight against Razor Hugh is held in the Grand Imperial Mall in Pacifica. The fight starts at 12:01 AM, and if V arrives before that time, they'll be prompted to skip the time on a nearby bench. Before the fight begins, Coach Fred will offer to double V's cash reward if they throw the fight and let Razor win. V can accept, ensuring they will receive the bonus no matter how they lose. If V wins the fight, then regardless of whether they took Fred's offer, they will still receive the standard amount of money as a reward.
Close to where Coach Fred privately speaks to V there is also a child that wants to talk to V. She will mention how her father fought Razor years ago, fell in the third round and despite the referee calling the match, Razor kept attacking, badly injuring him in the process. She says she wants Razor to pay for ruining her family's life.
Among the audience there are all of V's past opponents — Esquerdo & Certo, César Diego Ruiz, Rhino — and Viktor Vektor, who will tell V that Razor is weak to hits in the torso because he recently had new abdominal muscles implanted. Punching Razor in the gut will stagger him for a few seconds. Razor is fast and hits hard but can be stun-locked by repeatedly breaking his guard with charged punches using Gorilla Arms. He also badly telegraphs his moves; a well-timed guard will turn into a counter with a brief couple of seconds of slowed-down time, letting V get several key punches into his gut.
If V accepted to throw the fight and lost:
Coach Fred rewards V with the standard €$50,000 and an extra €$20,000. Viktor will notice this and criticize V for it.
If V accepted to throw the fight and won:
Fred will be angry, but they will still reward the merc with €$50,000. Viktor and the other fighters will compliment V for winning the fight.
If V didn't accept to throw the fight and lost:
Fred is happy that V has changed their mind, offering €$50,000 plus an extra that V can either accept or decline. If accepting, Viktor will notice this and criticize V for it.
If V didn't accept to throw the fight and won:
Coach Fred will reward the standard €$50,000. Viktor and the other fighters will compliment V for winning the fight.
If V talked to the child and won the fight:
As V is leaving the venue, V will overhear the girl having a phone conversation with someone where it appears she lied about her family's situation in order to motivate V to win the fight so she can win more money betting on Razor losing. When confronted, the child will run away.

Queen_of_the_Highway,Phantom_Liberty,"A day after helping Panam Palmer and the veteran Aldecaldos seize the Basilisk from Militech, V is contacted by Panam, telling them that they have completed the assembly of the panzer vehicle, and ask V if they want to drive it.
After accepting Panam's invite, V heads back to the Mobile Camp in Rocky Ridge to meet with her and the other Aldecaldos. Upon approaching them, they tell V that they're still finalizing a few little things, such as the panzer's Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics. Cassidy tells V that they left the Militech trucks at a nearby Raffen Shiv camp so that the corporation would start looking at them instead of the Aldecaldos. Upon telling them that they always dreamed of driving one of them, Panam tells V that they can climb inside the panzer.[N 1]
As V climbs inside the panzer, Panam joins them in the other seat and starts up the Basilisk, which does not go smoothly. After starting the machine, Panam ask V what they think about the machine, and explains that while connected to the vehicle's systems, it in essence becomes an extension of the body. As Panam pilots the vehicle out of the camp for a test run, she explains V that a co-pilot is needed to handle the sensory overload, which is why the pilot takes care of the vehicles movement and the co-pilot takes care of the vehicle weapon systems.[T 2]
Once far enough away from the camp, Panam disconnects from the vehicle, and instructs V to jack-in themselves and pilot for a short distance before asking them to maneuver through the Wind Farms. After piloting past several wind turbines, Panam tells V that it is time for some target practice, and asks that they take the five targets in the area.
After the target practice, Panam tells V that she will also be connecting to the vehicle. After she connects, V experiences strange feelings and asks Panam what happens. She explains that, while both jacked-in, the pilot and co-pilot's systems become intertwined.
If V romanced Panam:
Panam asks V if they want to ""try it out,"" which they accept, and a romantic scene will engage.
Suddenly, Panam and V are attacked and surrounded by the Raffen Shiv, and have to defeat them. Saul Bright contacts them over the radio, informing them that the Raffen Shiv have also started assaulting the camp, and instructs them to return to help.[N 2]
After defeating the Raffen Shiv, Panam and V park and exit the Basilisk, and proceed to meet with Saul. Saul tells Panam that she's been making the right decisions for the Aldecaldos family, and asks her that she leads them alongside him. He admits to Panam that he was wrong about her actions before, and proceeds to hug her. After hugging, Panam exclaims that things have to change in order for her to accept her new position, to which Saul responds that the first thing they have to do is find a new location for their camp before Militech and more Wraiths find them. The rest of the Aldecaldos congratulate Panam, before she asks that V follows her.
While walking, Panam and V reflect back on their adventure so far, and Panam tells V that it is mostly because of them that they've made it this far, and that if they were ever in the need of the Aldecaldos's help, they would have it. Upon arriving at the camp's bar, she will ask V what type of drink they'd like, and talk more with each other. While talking, Panam asks that V stay with the Aldecaldos, which V isn't sure about because of the situation they are in. As V turns away from the bar, they suffer from another Relic malfunction and drop to the floor.
Some time passes, and V is woken up by Panam inside a tent. Panam explains to V that while they were passed out, the Aldecaldos moved camp to a safer place. Panam proceeds to ask V what is happening to them, to which V will explain the unique situation they are in. After talking, V gets up and is met by Mitch and Saul, also asking V what happened.
After talking with them, Panam escorts V out of the camp back to their vehicle. While following Panam, she will tell V that the camp's new location is outside Militech's usual patrol areas and that they have a better tactical advantage due to the layout, but that despite that, they will soon have to move again.
Upon reaching V's vehicle, Panam will ask V how she can help them get better, to which they don't really have an answer but tell her that they will let her know if they do find more information.[N 3]","Leave the camp and wait for a day for the Basilisk to be ready.

Mower is a fairly tough opponent. In addition to punches that cause fire damage, she can also electrify the water you are standing in, causing damage. She also uses a submachine gun if you're not interested in slugging it out with her and choose to stay out of the water. As her health gets low, she will also use Optical Camo. Like the other Cyberpsycho Sighting gigs, you have the option to take her down using non-lethal methods for a bonus.

You can sneak in and find a computer in the basement where you can upload malware then sneak out again. However, there is no bonus reward for stealth in this mission, so it's better to just use violence so you can gather their gear to sell or dismantle.

Gig:_Going-away_Party,Phantom_Liberty,"Client Flavio dos Santos is on 6th Street's hit list after Will Gunner's successful coup, and V has to escort him to an Aldecaldo smuggler who can get Flavio out of town. However, there is a problem: instead of lying low at his hideout until V got there, Flavio threw a massive party. As V arrives at the dilapidated house, it has already been surrounded by 6th Street gang members who have massacred several joytoys. V must search the house to see if Flavio is still alive.
The first three entrances are in sight of enemies. Deactivated surveillance cameras can be used to scout some of the house's interior. To find Flavio to the second floor, and takes the door furthest from the stairs. The building has four points of egress - front door, the garage, back door, and a crawlspace under the house which leads to a hole in the floor.
V encounters a bloodbath, with Flavio the only survivor. Wake him, then lead him downstairs to the car waiting in the garage; you are required to use this car, if you leave it and try to switch to another vehicle Muamar Reyes send an angry message to you to get back or fail the gig. Drive the car down the street to a parking lot where the smuggler awaits. With that, V's part in Flavio's rescue is over, but the smuggler is upset that Flavio is bleeding out because he will not be paid if his client dies. As the smuggler frantically drives Flavio away to a ripperdoc, Muamar Reyes calls to pay V and close the gig.","This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝

Nika Yankovich, after learning her twin brother Gaspar had been brought to Haven Clinic, stormed into its premises with a group of fellow Scavengers and chased out Odell Blanco alongside all the patients after ripperdoc Anthony Anderson refused to let her see her sibling and barricaded himself in his office. Blanco reached out to Mr. Hands, who contacted the mercenary V to solve this predicament.
After talking to Odell—who has made a temporary clinic across the road at The Golden Fleece—V approaches the former church to find a way inside.[N 1]
Once inside, V deals with the Scavengers and goes downstairs to Anthony Anderson's office. There, they find Nika threatening the ripperdoc at gunpoint, demanding to see her brother. Anthony explains Gaspar overdosed and died after arriving at the clinic, but at least he could harvest his Implants to save other lives. Nika refuses and demands him to give her brother's corpse.
If V engages combat with Nika Yankovich:[N 2]
V neutralizes Nika, much to Anthony's relief.
If any Scavengers are still alive and conscious:
The other Scavengers are alerted to the situation, leading V to neutralize those that remain.
With the threat now taken care of, Anthony plans to clean up the mess and continue his work at the clinic.
After leaving the clinic, Mr. Hands congratulates V on a job well done. Anthony has apparently declined his offer of help in cleaning up the mess, instead choosing to examine the bodies himself.[N 3]
If V lets Nika Yankovich kill Anthony Anderson:[N 4]
V decides to leave Anthony's fate to Nika, who then beats Anthony to death. After leaving the the clinic, V returns to Odell and delivers the bad news. Odell laments Anthony's loss and says that they're finished, but V convinces him to keep the clinic running in his stead.
Mr. Hands is disappointed that V failed to protect Anthony. However, since the threat from the Scavengers has been dealt with, he decides to close the gig and consider it complete regardless.
If V manages to convince Anthony to tell Nika where Gaspar's body is:[N 5]
V managed to talk Anthony Anderson into submission and give up Gaspar Yankovich's body to his sister. He reveals that the body was kept in the ""cooling room"" in the room across from his office.
Mr. Hands is pleased that V managed the gig without killing anyone, because this way Anthony and his clinic won't have to fear a possible retaliation by the Scavengers.[N 6]","This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝

Transmission,Phantom_Liberty,"After clearing the Grand Imperial Mall and returning to Batty's Hotel, Brigitte leads V to the Maglev Tunnel beneath the Pacifica Serenity Bible Church. This is a hideout of the Voodoo Boys and the physical location of their Data Fortress, Rezo Agwe. Brigitte exploits V and Johnny Silverhand to communicate with Alt Cunningham, who can help the Voodoo Boys' members go through the Blackwall.
In cyberspace, V experiences one of Johnny's inaccurate memories. In the memory, the player will control Johnny in the year 2013.
Never Fade Away[]
Main article: Never Fade Away (quest)
In 2013, Alt Cunningham was abducted by goons hired by Arasaka. Johnny tried to defeat the goons but got ambushed by one of the goons using Mantis Blades. Johnny was later saved and taken to a Ripperdoc called Milt Nauman by Lyle Thompson, a Media who initially planned to meet Alt at the same time.
Later, Johnny hired Rogue and Santiago to break into Arasaka Tower and save Alt together. Rogue was initially unwilling to get involved. However, in the middle of the meeting between Johnny and the two, Arasaka agents broke in the location. They succesfully escaped from the agents. After defeating the agents, Johnny finally got into his car, with Lyle driving. Rogue and Santiago took motorcycles. They went to a safe place and planned the strike. Johnny organized his fans to make a rebellion against Arasaka, and decided to call Nancy to report the rebellion, in order to distract Arasaka. Then Johnny, Rogue, Santiago, and Lyle struck into Arasaka Tower and approached the mainframe. They finally found Alt, who had been jacked in Soulkiller. Johnny unceremoniously killed Toshiro next to Alt, and subsequently unplugged Alt from the mainframe, denying her to return to her body. Much to Johnny's madness, he punched Lyle since Lyle was still recording for the news. Then Johnny had to admit that Alt was dead.
The Blackwall[]
After the playback, V is returned to cyberspace. V talks to Johnny about the memory, and then flashes back to Brigitte in cyberspace. Brigitte takes V and her Netrunners next to the Blackwall, and sends V to go through the Blackwall and talks to Alt Cunningham for taking the Voodoo Boys' members through the Blackwall.
If V has chosen to cooperate with Bryce Mosley in I Walk the Line:
Because the shard given by the agent has removed Placide's malware in V but installed NetWatch's own tracker. Once the VDB's contact Alt, she realizes NetWatch is taking action and to stop them she flatlines the Voodoo Boys except for V.
After V exits cyberspace, with Brigitte and her Netrunners' bodies lying on the chairs, the rest of the Voodoo Boys' members led by Placide are on alert. V must defeat Placide and the remaining Voodoo Boys' members to escape the church.
If V has followed Placide's plan in I Walk the Line:
With Alt's aid, the Voodoo Boy's Netrunners successfully go through the Blackwall.
After V and Brigitte exit cyberspace, V confronts Brigitte, and Brigitte finally forces V to leave. V can go leave the church peacefully or choose to use violence.","Follow Brigitte.

After taking out the Satwave Power Plant, Panam Palmer and V chase after the crashing Kang Tao AV deep into the Jackson Plains of the southern Badlands. While chasing the AV, communications on the radio frequency have Mitch and Scorpion approach the AV first. Panam attempts to warn Mitch and Scorpion, but the EMP interferes, and she is unable to do so.
Panam and V are attacked by three Kang Tao Griffin drones which have to be taken down. V does so by jacking into Panam's truck and taking control of its machine gun. However, while V takes down the drones, the gun malfunctions, forcing Panam to put the truck on autodrive and fix the machine gun. She does so after several seconds, but a bullet ricochets into her back. Regardless, she goes back to driving, and V takes down the drones.
Panam and V arrive at the site of the AV crash. Panam takes an expired injector to deal with her wound. V agrees to go to the AV, while Panam stays to cover V with Mitch's gun.
If V abandons Panam and heads straight for the gas station (does NOT unlock I'll Fly Away):
V leaves Panam and single-handedly retrieves Hellman from a nearby gas station that he and his bodyguards sought refuge in. Panam then shows up with Aldecaldos reinforcements, saying that she managed to rescue Mitch herself and that unlike V, she does not bail. Her subsequent text messages will be very frustrated about her life outside the clan and include a remark about Mitch, who gave Scorpion an Aldecaldos-style funeral by himself.
If V assists Panam in clearing the wreckage (unlocks I'll Fly Away):
Nearing the AV's crash site, Panam instructs V to use a surveillance drone to identify any remaining Aldecaldo survivors and scan for enemies in the area, and the AV. After scanning the AV and Mitch, V can exit the drone. Panam provides overwatch while V takes out the hostile forces. As a last stand, the remaining Kang Tao operative takes Mitch captive and locks them both inside the AV. When opened by V, the operative can be intimidated (dialogue options ""only looking for Hellman"" and ""I'm losing my patience""), causing him to reveal Hellman's whereabouts. This allows Panam and V to immediately head for the gas station to the west that Hellman and his guards took refuge in.
Alternatively, V or Panam (if one waits too long) can shoot the soldier holding Mitch, the latter will tell the pair that Scorpion died during the assault, and that Kang Tao escaped using Aldecaldo vehicles. The group then has to follow the tire tracks around the wreckage to pursue find Hellman. Scanning the tire tracks allows V to see a simulation of where Kang Tao went. However, this delay will result in additional Kang Tao reinforcements present at the gas station.
V and Panam will subsequently head to the gas station via motorcycle. In the end, Aldecaldos reinforcements will arrive and Panam and V part ways after a short talk.
Regardless, once in the gas station, V searches for Hellman.
If V finds the gas station owner:
V finds the gas station owner locked in a room behind the counter. He tells V that he is unarmed, and can tell V that Hellman is on the second floor.
V finds Hellman being attended to by a Kang Tao medic. Hellman panics about Arasaka being sent after him, but V knocks him out.[N 1] They call Goro Takemura, telling him to meet them at the Sunset Motel. They then carry Hellman outside, where they meet with the Aldecaldos. After V and Panam talk, she allows V to take Scorpion's Apollo, and V takes Hellman to the motel.
V wakes Hellman up once there in a motel room. V tries to get Hellman to help them with their biochip, doing so by explaining the biochip, how they have it, and what they've tried to do about it so far. He tells V that the biochip was experimental, and that the biochip was in its trial phase. After some conversation about the biochip, Hellman jacks into V to examine the biochip. He then tells V that they cannot function independently of the biochip, as their neural network has deteriorated too much for that to be possible. He also says that all he can do is to send V to a clinic in Sweden, and help V minimize their pain. He can then ask V about how they deal Johnny Silverhand's engram, although V can choose to not to talk about it. V threatens Hellman, and he offers to help them if they come with him to Kang Tao, which V refuses.
Takemura walks into the motel room, interrupting the conversation. Hellman gives V a chip containing a blueprint to V's brain and the biochip. V exits the motel room, leaving Hellman with Takemura. As V leaves, however, their relic malfunctions, and V talks with Silverhand's engram. Once V is finished talking to Silverhand, the mission will end.","Chase the AV.

Lightning_Breaks,Phantom_Liberty,"Panam Palmer asks V to meet her again during midnight at the garage near the Sunset Motel in Rocky Ridge, to discuss their plan on how to take down the Kang Tao AV.
When V meets her there, she will be working on her truck. She quickly finishes up, and she and V will discuss a plan to use an EMP launched from a power station to take down the Kang Tao AV, and enter the AV to take Anders Hellman.
After they discuss the plan, V rides with Panam to the location where they plan to take down the AV. While on their way there, Panam stops the car, and lets V calibrate to the machine gun attached to her car, requiring V to jack in and shoot at a few abandoned vehicles with it. Afterwards, they discuss how they plan to launch the EMP using the power station.
V and Panam then wait a few hours for the AV to fly over before making their way to the power station. Upon arriving, V jacks into Panam's machine gun mounted to her car, and they are chased down by a few drones that V must shoot down. Once the drones are shot down, V jacks out of the gun, and Panam drives her car into the entrance of a control station. There, V overcharges the terminal, and rushes back to Panam's car, and they drive out of and away from the power station to a cliff looking over it, as to ensure the pulse from the EMP does not interfere with them.
Panam gives V the detonator for the EMP, and they wait a brief period of time before they spot the AV flying over coming from Pacifica. V triggers the detonator, which does not work immediately, and sends the EMP too late to take the AV out of the sky. Panam steps out of the truck, and uses an RPG to shoot down the AV herself. This does not take it down either, but does force it to lose altitude. This leads directly into Life During Wartime.","Meet Panam at midnight.

A few days after helping Delamain recover their divergent vehicles, V encounters a traffic jam on the Ring Road in Corpo Plaza, City Center.[N 2]
Upon approaching the traffic jam, V will encounter three Delamain Cab that have intercepted a Kaukaz truck, and Johnny Silverhand will project himself to talk to V. Johnny suggests that V try and contact Delamain to investigate further.
When V calls Delamain, it quickly becomes clear to them what is happening. The virus that has been corrupting Delamain's systems has now also infected the core system, and Delamain asks V for help.
If 48 hours have passed after completing Epistrophy:
A few days after helping Delamain recover their divergent vehicles, Delamain calls V to let them know that they are in need of help, as the virus they discovered has now also infected their core systems.
Upon arriving at Delamain Headquarters, V finds Delamain having difficulties communicating. It tries to open the doors toward the offices and garages but fails to do so. Unable to find any other ways to enter through the reception area, V leaves the building and manages to find an alternative entry point.[N 3]
Inside the building, V searches for a way to open the locked door that is barring their way. They manage to find a terminal, with which they can unlock the door.[N 4] As V treads through the hallway onto the workshop, they can hear multiple drones patrolling the area and attacking each other.
After managing to find a way across the workshop floor, V enters the control room. In the control room, each divergent Delamain tries to influence V by asking to be set freed by them, with the exception of the original Delamain, who asks V to reset the core.
As V approaches the core, Johnny projects himself in front of them, asking V to not reset the core.[N 5][N 6]
If V resets the core:
V chooses to reset the core and restores the original Delamain.[N 5] Because resetting the core also wipes his memory, Delamain has no recollection of who V is, but is able to access previous logs to identify them as the person who has helped them get rid of the virus by resetting the core.

V can intervene by speaking with Officer Aldwyn. V can choose to demand that the officers leave the man alone, which turns them hostile, or turn a blind eye and walk away.
If V has a Streetkid background, they have an additional dialogue option to learn more about the beaten man's circumstances. The man, Nigel Hamilton, is a wealthy corpo who showed an XBD to a girl that put her into a coma. That woman happened to be the daughter of one of Aldwyn's friends, and Aldwyn was taking justice into his own hands since Hamilton's status meant he was going to avoid being charged with a crime. V can then persuade the officers to leave peacefully by volunteering to deal with Hamilton for them.

In lieu of betting money, Ruiz will stake his ride, the Villefort Alvarado ""Vato"". In turn, you'll need to stake €$20,000.
This match may seem difficult at first, especially if challenging him at a lower level. Ruiz has a large health pool, and his signature attack can knock you out in as few as two hits. Fortunately, his signature attack has an extremely obvious tell. Back away from him a good distance, making sure to leave ample room to move on the right. Ruiz will put up his fists and step with a blur effect towards you before jumping and throwing a punch. Simply circle to the right of him when he begins to blur or before he jumps and his attack will be completely avoided, leaving him wide open for a few seconds. Punch Ruiz's head a few times before he turns around, then back off and wait for your stamina to recover. Rinse and repeat until he goes down.
You can also cheat a bit to give you a slight advantage by littering recovery items and non-lethal melee weapons on the court and pick them up during the fight to get around the block usually in place on these items during matches. Furthermore, recovery implants and the Gorilla Arms implant can be freely used if you have them installed.

Some time after completing I Fought the Law, River will call V, needing assistance and requests them to meet him in person to discuss the details.
After you get to the designated location and wait for him to arrive, he'll pull up in his truck. Get in and talk to him a bit but he's not really in a chatty mood and will instead send you a video clip to watch of a news reel. It'll reveal a man named Anthony Harris who's also the dubbed ""Peter Pan"" serial killer being apprehended in his car by NCPD as one of his victims falls out of the vehicle. Anthony tries to run but is shot down by police and the clip will note the victim died from septic shock. Meanwhile Anthony, while still alive, is comatose in a hospital so there's no way to interrogate him about where other victims are being held.
After it finishes, River will reveal while Peter Pan was never his case, his nephew, Randy, recently went missing and the victim in the video was wearing Randy's shoes. Furthermore, the detective that is on the case isn't doing much and so it's not looking good in finding Randy in time and River isn't on good terms with his sister so he doesn't know much about Randy's disappearance. But he does have an idea: to try and view Anthony's dreams as a braindance to see if enough clues can be found to find and save Randy.
NCPD Lab[]
With that, get out of the vehicle and follow River across the street to the lab, but he'll note he doesn't have access to get inside. Head to the left from the entrance to find an alleyway with a door with a leveled Technical Ability requirement. Alternatively, V can head to the right from the entrance to find a door with a leveled Body requirement. Alternatively, one can use a container to get over the wall next to the first door.
River will inform V that the place is empty, so the pair won't be disturbed. Head to the central area and enter the child's room to the side and scan the file cabinets here to locate Anthony's file. While searching them, V and River will be interrupted by Yawen Packard. After some back and forth where River will blackmail Yawen into helping. She will reveal that Anthony isn't dreaming, so they can't get any BDs off him. River will take it upon himself to find a way and heads out.
Go through the front door where Johnny will talk a bit and, if using a female V, he'll note River seems rather interested in V. Get in River's vehicle and he'll start driving out to his sister's place while you can talk to him about his suspension, Randy, and the case.
Visiting Joss[]
The pair will eventually arrive at Joss', who isn't happy either about seeing River but will agree to let him and V look through Randy's stuff if it means finding something that could help bring back her son. Follow River to the other trailer where Randy was living and look around for clues. In particular, to be successful in saving Randy in time, V will need enough major clues. Some of these clues include:
In the kitchen area pick up the key on the shelf near the table and use it to unlock the cabinet in Randy's bedroom
Have enough Intelligence to hack Randy's computer (or scan the record player in the hallway to learn the password)
Read all the messages and files on the computer
On the ""Net"" tab click the image of the red people to find the secret website, then on that site, click the ""Join Us"" then ""Files"" tabs, then back to the computer's main files to view the video again. River will then send this to Yawen to see if that gets Anthony dreaming
While it helps, it's not necessary to find Harris' IP address (high Intelligence required). To do so exit out like normal from the computer but this time one will have the option to tell him V can or lack the skills to do so. V can also find enough clues in the BDs to compensate for this if V does not enough Intelligence to find the IP.
After doing everything one can, follow River back over to Joss to talk to her about the findings. Agree to stay and V can talk a bit to Joss before heading to bed. River will wake them up some time later with good news: the video worked, and Anthony is dreaming. One will now need to scroll the BDs they got for additional clues:
School
3 visuals: the teacher, the bulletin boards, and the trophy case
Childhood Barn
7 Visuals: Young Anthony, the cow, Anthony's father, the console to the left of Anthony's father, the injection system console Anthony passes, the dietary supplements across the barn, and the cartoon playing
Note if one found enough clues in this one, V may not be able to scan the last one (the optional objective to find clues may disappear if this is the case)
Adulthood Barn
13 Visuals: Solar box, clock, electrical parts, fuel barrels, victims x3, infusion pump, FDNC certificate, computer, crawling victim, number to top left of barn entrance, towers of light (outside the barn)
Audio: AV sounds (through the ceiling)
If V found enough clues, River will deduce the correct location is Edgewood Farm, or if one has already travelled to the farm before, V will recognise it if they scan the towers of light. Otherwise, one will need to guess, though it is in the list of guessing options so V can select it there if they didn't get enough clues. That said, if V guesses the wrong farm, Randy won't be found in time. Romance note: If one wishes to romance River, they need to make sure to pick the right farm here, otherwise it'll lock River's last quest out and he won't be able to be romanced.
Finding Randy[]
Edgewood Farm doesn't have any enemies, but the yard is littered with mines, along with four turrets and several cameras. In addition, leaving the area will result in both River and Randy dying (as River will be killed from the barn's defenses and nobody else will arrive in time to save Randy).
If one does not or cannot turn off the defenses individually, the house nearby contains a desk with a switch underneath. Pressing it to reveals a hidden room with a second computer that will turn off the turrets and cameras. The Tinker Bell can be found nearby as well. If done, V will only need to worry about the mines as they make their way to the left of the barn entrance where a ladder is located. Use it to get up on the roof and enter through an opening here. River will find Randy but needs V to turn off the BD machine in the control room before he can unplug Randy. After doing so, head back around to help the other three victims (two will still be alive). Afterwards, River will call for V for their assistance, so go help him out and then it'll fast forward to where the police have arrived and working on getting the victims to the hospital. River though still has one more agenda: Anthony has to die. Romance note: Do not select the ""count me out"" option here if one wishes to romance him. After some more dialogue, River will part with the Trauma Team, ending the quest.","Meet with River Ward in the evening.

Double_Life,Phantom_Liberty,"V and Judy save Evelyn Parker from the Scavengers' XBD studio at an abandoned power plant, and Evelyn is taken to Judy's apartment to recover.
After speaking with Judy, she heads into the apartments workspace to continue tweaking the braindances extracted from Evelyn. You can approach and sit beside Evelyn, but she simply lies on the bed without any reply.
Afterwards, you can visit Judy's editing room, and Judy will show you the two BDs extracted from Evelyn.
The First BD[]
In this BD, Evelyn is talking to the female Netrunner who hired Evelyn to record the BD of Yorinobu's penthouse. Unfortunately, the woman's face detail was strongly encrypted and neither V nor Judy are able to figure out who she is. V notices a symbol on the Holoview and concludes the contractor must be working with the Voodoo Boys. Additionally, V believes the location to be Pacifica according to the flyers on the ground near Evelyn, and the vévé markings around the altar.
The Second BD[]
In this BD, Evelyn is in an alley, while the Netrunner speaks to someone on the phone while remaining concealed at the bottom of a staircase. According to the dialogue between the woman and the other Netrunner, V and Judy find out that they need to meet Alt Cunningham in cyberspace via Johnny Silverhand's engram.

It's important to note this gig only becomes available after completing Playing for Time, and can only be started between 8pm and 5am (otherwise it'll disappear off the map if you're outside these hours). Upon arriving, V will see a massacre of bodies and entrails strewn everywhere. They question a dying Maelstrom who speaks in riddles, shortly dying. A shard is on the gang member, that when cracked, talks about a ritual, summoning the cyberpsycho Zaria Hughes from a strewn refrigerator. She is extremely quick, running towards V with her Mantis Blades.

Violence,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Remove bullet points]
A short time after completing Search and Destroy, V receives a text message from an unknown caller seeking their help. They are told to meet at the No-Tell Motel.
Inside the motel room, V finds a woman in shining chrome with her back to them. Once she starts talking, V learns that she is Lizzy Wizzy, the renowned celebrity musician. She'll eventually reveal that she suspects that her manager and new boyfriend, Liam Northom, is cheating on her. Given her privacy concerns and highly public profile, she wants V to discreetly investigate the matter at the Riot nightclub, which Liam frequents.
V can only enter the club after 8pm. There are several different ways to enter:
The front door, guarded by a bouncer (requires Body to intimidate the bouncer or sufficient Street Cred).
The fire escape in the alley to the left of the building. Ladder can be lowered by hitting or shooting it.
The door to the security room just inside the garage on the right side of the building (requires Intelligence to hack the keypad). An employee badge can also be found on the desk with the computer.
The garage door, to the right of the security room door inside the garage (requires Body to lift the metal shutters).
V does not need to find Liam, but instead find a computer with surveillance feed. To do so, if V acquires the employee badge, go to the door opposite the male bartender and follow the marker to the elevator and head down to street level. The computer can also be reached directly by hacking the door to the security room from the exterior garage (see above). Use the computer and access the surveillance cameras to find Liam talking with a woman in the VIP lounge. V quickly learns it is actually not a romantic affair: Liam is with an Arasaka employee, discussing about making a backup of Lizzy. After listening to the full conversation, Johnny Silverhand appears briefly, where he suggests acquiring the video footage as proof. Interact with the computer again to obtain the video footage. After this, V can call Lizzy to complete the mission, or optionally confront Liam. Note that V cannot confront Liam after calling Lizzy.
Liam can be found in the VIP lounge on the third floor. The male bartender on the second floor can be convinced to reveal his location with either a bribe or a threat (requires Body). V can access the VIP lounge from a second elevator in the security room aforementioned.
If V decides to confront Liam, he will demand to know why they are there:
V claims they went to the wrong room:
Liam demands that V leaves. If V takes too long, the security guards will become hostile, and V will not be able to interact with Liam again.
V threatens to expose Liam's misdeeds:
V can extort Liam for a very substantial payout (30,000 €$) in exchange for the promise of not telling anyone what he is up to. Even if V promised Liam that they wouldn't tell their employer what happened, V can still tell Lizzy the truth.
Upon calling Lizzy, V can lie or tell the truth.
Tell Lizzy it was just an affair:
This ends the job. Lizzy is somewhat satisfied with V's work, even though they don't have proof of the affair. Within an hour or so, Lizzy will send a 1,900 €$ payment as thanks. Part 2 will not trigger if V tells Lizzy that Liam was having an affair, even if they downloaded the security footage.
Tell Lizzy about the secret plot:
This temporarily ends the job. Lizzy is distraught and abruptly hangs up. Within an hour or two, Lizzy sends a 2,800 €$ payment as thanks. If V overheard Liam's conversation and captured the security footage, Part 2 of this job will trigger within a few days.
Part 2[]
If V has told Lizzy the truth, she will call them several days later and ask to meet again at the No-Tell Motel. When V returns, they see that Liam is lying dead on the floor, with Lizzy standing over him. She explains that she pushed him and without realizing the strength of her chrome arms. If V scans Liam, they can note to Lizzy that she strangled him. After some dialogue, she will panic briefly about the possibility of the media finding out before considering her audience's titillating reaction. Eventually, she will ask V to dispose of the body.
Refuse to dispose of Liam's body:
V refuses, telling Lizzy that something isn't right. Lizzy says, ""On the contrary, everything is falling into place. Go, V. And shut the door.""
Agree to dispose of Liam's body:
V says they'll take care of the body and tell Lizzy to sleep soundly. Lizzy responds that she doesn't need to sleep, then thanks Liam's body for a beautiful gift. V asks what she's talking about, but Lizzy dismisses V, telling them to go and take the body and dispose of it.
Afterwards, Lizzy will send eddies and a messaging of thanks. A few days later, Lizzy will send another message saying that their ""adventure"" was very inspirational and she put out her new BD thanks to V.","Meet with the mysterious client at No-Tell Motel.

Kerry will be on the deck of one of the yachts moored nearby, calling you aboard. After you sit down next to Kerry, he will activate the autopilot of the vessel, ""Seamurai,"" which will begin to sail to open waters. Kerry will start playing a new song on one of five custom-built Lancaster guitars as Johnny appears nearby. Kerry will muse on life's cycles and explain that the purpose of this little boat trip to close on chapter and begin a new one, and he needs V's company to do so.

Some time later, all competitors have arrived, consisting of two Wraiths teams and three Aldecaldo teams, one of which consists of Jakub Antonowicz and Margot Wojciechowicz.

Gig:_Talent_Academy,Phantom_Liberty,"V meets Mr. Hands' netrunner Baird near the entrance of the academy. Baird briefs V on his cover-up story and their main objective: reaching Fiona Vargas' office to steal all the tax-related data in their computer after pretending to be a recruiter for a San Diego sports team. V may ask for more details about their cover-up story: the netrunner declines to elaborate since V's fake identity is only supposed to get them into the facility and they shouldn't speak about themselves once inside.
If V tells the barman they work for a San Diego sports team:
While chatting with the barman upon entering the Academy, V can tell him they work for a San Diego sports team. Another man then turns to V and starts asking inquisitive questions about specific people from the staff of their supposed club. Without any good answer from V, a suspicious guard is called to take V for another security check. After the check fails, every Academy member turns hostile to V.
If V doesn't talk to the barman:
V can tell the Barman they don't want to chat. One of the kids on exhibition will crack the glass screen in front of him, and this will cause the bartender to leave. Nobody will be watching the nearby door marked Personnel only, and they can use it to sneak into the staff only areas.
If V wants to sneak into Fiona Vargas' office:
V can sneak into the underground facility by going directly to their right after exiting the elevator to the Exhibition Hall. A guard is monitoring an access to a technical back office where the Academy's netrunner works. There is a computer V can use to disconnect the surveillance system. A vent hole in the wall provides access to a technical shaft from which V can drop in a lab in the underground facility and meet Dr. Vargas. Double jump is required to go back in this tunnel through the ceiling.

Fiona's office is located one floor below the main floor, entering the office seems to cause the door to lock behind you. When you enter the office, you will see Tommie Walker trying to find something in the drawers and spend some time talking to him. When you try to steal the data from Fiona's terminal, it will fail and Fiona will walk in. After some talking, Fiona will make you an offer to leak some data of low importance. You can ask about Tommie's chances of getting signed, and accept Fiona's offer to leak the data and ensure that Tommie gets signed. Regardless of which option you choose, the rewards are the same and Mr Hands is satisfied. Note that the elevator is disabled after the quest, nor can you go back to the exhibition hall after taking the elevator from Fiona's office.
She will prompt V to leave, while they can decide to kill her right there. V can choose to kill Fiona Vargas after they decided what to do about her offer. If V kills her, Johnny will appear and express satisfaction about it, and V can grab Fiona's elevator key, which can shortcut to the ground floor.
Once the quest is completed, V can find Tommie Walker helping his dad David Walker at the EBM Petrochem Stadium. If V shut down the facility and let Tommie's father know, he'll resent them for shutting down their only chance at getting out of Dogtown.","Go to the location provided by Mr. Hands.

Mr. Hands contacts V with a new gig. In Longshore Stacks' The Scraper, Scavengers have taken possession of a prototype Zetatech implant. V is tasked with retrieving the prototype from the Scraper by any means necessary.
Getting closer to the prototype's signal atop the Scraper, V encounters Hasan Demir, a former Techie for Zetatech, whom had the prototype implant installed in his own ocular system. After freeing Hasan and leading him safely out of the base, V has several options.
Essentially, your choice boils down to turning Hasan over to Zetatech or letting him escape with the prototype while you (and Mr. Hands) keep the schematics.
Hasan will explain his side, and V will get a choice of two dialogue options:
If V contacts Mr. Hands:
V and Mr. Hands decide Hasan's fate together.
If V sends the coordinates:
V turns Hasan over to Zetatech.
If V tells Mr. Hands to let Hasan go:
Mr. Hands sides with V and lets Hasan go after the prototype is safely removed. After a few days, Hasan will contact V after having set up shop in Longshore Stacks. Choosing this option leads to Go Your Own Way.
If V directly lets Hasan go:
V keeps the schematics for Mr. Hands. A few days later, Mr. Hands texts V to tell them a vendor appeared on the market selling the exact same Zetatech implant, adding ""it might still interest you to learn he was last seen in a Golden Pacific squat"".

Tune_Up,Phantom_Liberty,"After V's car is wrecked by the divergent Delamain Cab, V is contacted by Delamain to visit Delamain Corporation's headquarters on Pajaro street in Vista del Rey, Heywood, to assess the damages done to V's vehicle and receive compensation.
When V arrives at the location and enters the building, it is evident that they are not the only one that was attacked by a rogue cab, as numerous other Night citizens are there to file a complaint against the company. As V cuts in line and talks to the receptionist—which is currently running on a subroutine of Delamain's core. After V's identity is confirmed, Delamain himself will take over and talk to V and apologizes to them, and explains to V that they are currently occupied dealing with an internal crisis. As compensation for their damaged car, Delamain transfers V a sum of 4900 eurodollars.[N 1]","Go to Delamain HQ.

I_Fought_the_Law,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Add conditional statements. Rewrite from V's perspective where necessary]
At some point after Life During Wartime, V will receive a call from an Elizabeth Peralez, wife to mayoral candidate Jefferson Peralez. She doesn't wish to discuss anything over the holo so requests to meet in person.
Once V reaches the meeting point, they are instructed to enter the car so they can then talk more freely with the couple, who note their suspicions that they believe Night City's late mayor, Lucius Rhyne, was murdered rather than dying from heart complications. They then ask V to edit a braindance from an attempted attack on Rhyne shortly before his death to see if they are able to get any clues from it. V learns a few key pieces of evidence from it, namely that an NCPD detective by the name of River Ward showed up needing to talk with their security just before the attack and took out the would-be assailant Péter Horváth; that a place called the Red Queen's Race was mentioned; and that Weldon Holt, the deputy mayor, is running as the mayoral candidate now in Rhyne's place.
After discussing these details with Peralez, they'll then give V River's contact information to call the detective. Call River up who'll agree to meet with V to discuss the case at Chubby Buffalo's BBQ in The Glen. When V arrives, they'll find him talking with his fellow detective Harold Han, who sounds like he's told River more than once to stop digging into Rhyne's case and that even his superior has told River to let it go. River dismisses this and Han will leave so that V and River can talk.
Investigating Leads[]
This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝Reason: Needs more information
After a short conversation in the diner, V follows River to his vehicle and gets in to have a more private conversation where River reveals that he suspects that someone in the precinct let Péter Horváth loose, as he was apprehended earlier that day. The conversation eventually turns to how to find the Red Queen's Race and he'll gives V two possible leads to follow up on: check with one of his informants and check with Péter's employer.
At the store, the informant, Neil White, will run as soon as you use the Igor line, but River corners him before he can get very far in the alley. Neil will eventually reveal the location of the club, but also notes when asked they closed it shortly after Rhyne's death.
At the Cherry Blossom Market, V and River look for Christine Markov, Péter's employer in Japantown. They split off to ask the other vendors where she is and eventually V learns of her location via one of them or River will learn of it and text you. Regardless, head to the back left area of the market to find her.
Unfortunately, she won't be able to reveal much, only that Péter was always off his rocker and making erratic speeches about the late mayor before showing up one day with all the latest implants, having been sponsored by someone who ""finally saw his worth"". Follow River back to his vehicle to find some Tyger Claws poking around it, having recognized it as River's. You can choose to intervene or stay quiet here. If you stay quiet, they'll leave peacefully. If you intervene, one them asks how high you can jump. Jumping will get them to leave quietly, otherwise they become hostile. If things stayed quiet, or they were dealt with non-lethally, River will be pleased as it means less paperwork for him, and you will be able to go with him.
Once you've done both leads (or did the informant first) you can then head out to the club's location in Charter Hill.
Investigating the Club[]
As River is NCPD, he can't enter the premises without a warrant, so V has to go in alone here. V can try talking to the Animals member at the entrance gate, but she'll basically tells the place is closed and they're not allowed in, so they'll need to find another way in.
The club's entrance is hidden in one of the large shipping crates inside the warehouse. Open the crate's doors and head down using the elevator to enter the club where more Animals are roaming. The office and boss you're looking for is in the back, on the second floor and can easily be grabbed from behind in a chokehold to interrogate if you wish to go that route. If so, she'll reveal the Animals were hired to smash up the place and the only reason they're still hanging out is the one who hired them, Weldon Holt, still hasn't paid up. Once she's dealt with, you can check the computer where the messages confirm this. However, also check the files to see Ward's partner, Han, is also behind the coverup. River will then tell you to get out of there so you guys can confront Han but if you haven't already, go check the booth where Rhyne died to find the braindance wreath he had on. Interact with it and you'll pass out and River will break in to get to you. After a short conversation, you'll reveal what you learned from the wreath: someone spiked it and that's what killed Rhyne, not a heart attack. With that, you can choose to look around some more or leave with River, which will fast forward you to Chubby Buffalo's to confront Han.
Wrapping up the Case[]
River will ask who gave Han the orders to cover everything up, but Han won't say who and, with a few small conversations from you, Han will just note this is how Night City works and he's just doing his job in protecting his ""family"", that is the NCPD. This will allow River to deduce he knows who gave the order and he'll have to file it with Internal Affairs, but Han notes it won't do anything good, other than put River in their sights, before he drives off.
You can then talk to River about what he plans to do and eventually have the option to tell him to do it or not, but regardless what you say River is set on trying to re-open the case with the new information. With that, call Elizabeth and she'll ask you to visit their apartment to discuss it in person. When you get there though and start to head up in the elevator, Johnny will give some advice to not tell them anything, that whatever is going on is much deeper than they realize. However, you can choose to withhold the information or tell the couple what you learned, but regardless they'll be happy and conclude on their own what's going on and will pay you your fee.","Meet with Elizabeth Peralez.

Head over to the building but be careful going into the basement, as there's mines set up in the stairwell. Once you take care of them, go into the basement room, where you can see Chang Hoon Nam over on the chair. Try to talk to him but he's unresponsive; apparently whatever job he was doing last caused a corp to fry his brain, but he's still alive.
Check his computer for messages and red lights will come on. Follow these into a small dead-end hallway and look down to see a grate you can open. You'll have a couple more mines to take care of in the tunnel here before you can un-crouch into another room where the shard you need to bring him back can be found. You can also skip this altogether and force the doors open, but this requires 20 body. Once you have it, exit the room through the door and interact with Chang Hoon to add the shard.

There are three possible entrances to the NCPD Precinct:
The first is through the front door using the key provided by Stella. BARGHEST guards occasionally patrol this area however, and the front desk inside has additional guards waiting.
There is a locked door to the right of the precinct, which can be opened with 15 Body. This leads into a side room adjacent to a room which only has a single unaware guard inside.
A hatch on top of the aforementioned side room can be opened with 10 Technical Ability. However, the hatch is watched from the outside by a single BARGHEST soldier.
In the storage room before the garage, you can find Volkodav, an iconic machete, in an airdrop cargo container.
If you kill Dodger, he will drop the Rosco iconic revolver.
To escape without fighting Dodger while keeping Mitchell and Wilson alive, you will need to tell the whole truth as well as at most knocking out the BARGHEST soldiers - if you killed any BARGHEST, a fight will break out unless you have chosen the Cool dialogue option.
If you fought Dodger:
If you save both Bill Mitchel and Charles Wilson and kill Carl ""Dodger"" Robinson, then Bill will later call to start the side job New Person, Same Old Mistakes.
If you peacefully walk away:
Both Bill and Charles managed to survive through a peaceful resolution with Dodger. Some time later, V could then encounter Bill near Coyoacan in the Glen. During this encounter, Bill lamented about being blackmailed by Dodger, saying it might have been better if V had killed him.","Meet with Stella.

V comes across a street musician playing on a guitar, and Johnny Silverhand will ask if V likes his music. After a brief exchange, Johnny will note that bootlegs of Samurai concerts might still exist. He'll then note that an old club they used to play at, Rainbow Cadenza, is nearby, if they want to check for those bootlegs.
V heads over only to find it is now a food joint, which Johnny will remark on. V head inside and speaks to the staff, who points V to an old vendor nearby who keeps bugging them about the old club. The vendor, Karim Noel, located at a stall nearby, and he'll talk a lot about Samurai and Johnny before V is able ask him about the bootlegs. You'll have to convince him that you're a true Samurai fan before he would even entertain the idea of selling the records to you.
Karim will quiz you. When you call on Johnny for assistance, he'll give you an answer, but when you tell the vendor, it's actually wrong. You can then ask Johnny for the correct one and he'll give it. This time Karim will be impressed and will give you the bootleg for free.
Once V has the SAMURAI Concert Recording, Johnny will discuss the vendor, noting Karim may be a big fan and knows all his lyrics, but never took the time to understand that Johnny was calling for change, and instead Karim remains stuck in the 2020s. Answer Johnny how you wish and the quest will conclude.
If V is a Corpo:
V will then tell a story to the vendor about how if a corpo newbie from Arasaka doesn't make their deadline, the ghost of a man will split him into two, telling the vendor more that the ghost is Johnny Silverhand, impressing him.

The_Pickup,Phantom_Liberty,"After meeting with Dexter DeShawn, V is instructed to obtain the Flathead−a prototype Militech combat bot−from the Maelstromer's led by Royce at the All Foods Factory in Northside, Watson. V was also given the number of a Militech internal affairs agent named Meredith Stout, who they can reach out to for more information regarding the Militech gear that was stolen from the convoy.[1]
Militech Meeting [Optional][]
If V calls the Militech agent [Optional]:

V reaches out to Meredith Stout. V knows about the bind Meredith is in and proposes to meet. The parties meet eachother at a storm channel under the overpass near the All Foods Factory in Northside. While approaching Meredith, V is overwhelmed by one of her bodyguards, who jacks into V's personal link to start an aggressive but brief interrogation. Stout asks V if they are alone and if they know if Anthony Gilchrist is the one who leaked information about the Militech convoy. The bodyguard disengages the link and lets V go, who proposes to make a deal with Meredith, information in exchange for the Militech Flathead. Meredith agrees to V's proposition, under the condition that V pays for the Flathead with a Militech Credchip.
V accepts Meredith's offer:
V receives a Militech Credchip infected with a daemon from Meredith Stout in order to pay for the Flathead.
If V uses Breach Protocol on the Militech Credchip successfully:
To remove the daemon

V uses Breach Protocol to breach the Militech Credchip, and was able to remove the daemon infecting the shard. This results in 10,000 eurodollars from the shard at a later point.
To make a copy
V uses Breach Protocol to breach the Militech Credchip, and was able to make a copy of the infected shard. This causes them to obtain a Synapse Burnout quickhack.
To remove the daemon and make a copy
V uses Breach Protocol to breach the Militech Credchip, and was able to remove the daemon infecting the shard, allowing them to retrieve 10,000 from the shard at a later point. In the process, they also made a copy of shard which causes them to obtain a Synapse Burnout, and allowing them to retrieve 10,000 eurodollars from the shard at a later point.
V declines Meredith's offer:
After declining Meredith's offer to pay for the Flathead using a Militech Credchip, V has to come up with an alternative to pay for the combat bot.

All Foods[]
Arriving at the All Food Factory, V meets up with Jackie Welles, and together they approach the main entrance gate of the factory. Using the intercom, they speak with Dum Dum−a high-ranking Maelstrom member−and are let inside after telling him that they are there for the Flathead. Making their way to the meeting point inside the factory, Jackie and V evade various deactivated traps. 
Entering the meat processing area of the factory, the duo takes an elevator up to the room where they meet face-to-face with Dum Dum.


This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Rewrite from V's perspective as a story walkthrough using {{Condition}} as per our Manual of Style, removal of bullet points]
Path 1 - Instant Death[]
This occurs if all of the following conditions are met:

V does not point a weapon at nor attack any of the Maelstrom gang members after entering their hideout
When Jackie refuses to sit down, V intervenes and asks him to do so
V takes too long to reply to Royce when he asks how they are going to pay
Royce simply shoots V in the head, necessitating a prior save.

Path 2 - A Peaceful Transaction[]
This occurs if all of the following conditions are met:

V does not take the chip from Meredith Stout
V does not point a weapon at nor attack any of the Maelstrom gang members after entering their hideout
When Jackie refuses to sit down, V intervenes and asks him to do so
V pays Royce with €$ 10,000 of their own cash
V obtains the Flathead, and is led peacefully from the premises by Dum Dum, who will then also give them his Black Lace inhaler if they have the Streetkid lifepath (even if they have rejected to take a whirl earlier). Provided Meredith Stout is not called, this is one possible way to unlock access to the Maelstrom Weapon Vendor, who will appear after completing the job. This is also a guaranteed way to keep Dum Dum alive, which in turn enables V to kill or incapacitate him during a later mission in which he carries his iconic gun that can then be looted.

Path 3 - Siding with Militech[]
This occurs if all of the following conditions are met:

V does take the chip from Meredith Stout
V does not point a weapon at nor attack any of the Maelstrom gang members after entering their hideout
When Jackie refuses to sit down, V intervenes and asks him to do so
V pays Royce either with a) the chip including its malware but giving Royce a heads-up warning (Corpo lifepath only), b) with the chip after removing its malware, or c) with €$ 10,000 of their own cash
After the transaction, Militech operatives will storm the All Foods Factory and start attacking the Maelstrom gang members. This is one of two options that allows to find and free former Maelstrom leader Brick (see below). If Brick is not freed and Dum Dum survives the mission, he can be encountered during a later mission in which he carries his iconic gun that can then be looted. After helping Maelstrom fighting off the Militech ambush and escaping the plant, Anthony Gilchrist will appear at the end of the mission, acknowledging that they are now even for saving one another's lives. This will result in Gilchrist eventually having Meredith Stout killed. Having the Nomad lifepath, V can also expose him as the mole by finding his message to Maelstrom on a computer in a sideroom of the first larger hall they enter after leaving the initial negotiation room in the All Foods Plant (only as a Nomad V can comprehend the full meaning of the message). Confronting Gilchrist with this at the end of the mission will cause him to promise an incentive to keep the information confidential. This will be a crate containing Militech equipment left at V's Apartment in Act 2.

Path 4 - Fight Maelstrom[]
This occurs if any of the following conditions were met:

V either pointed a weapon at or attacked any of the Maelstrom gang members after entering their hideout (Royce will appear as strong boss fight at the end; killing him rewards €$ 3,000).
V turns off or otherwise does anything to affect the cameras or turrets within the hideout (Royce will appear as strong boss fight at the end; killing him rewards €$ 3,000).
When Jackie refused to sit down, V did not ask him to do so (Royce will appear as strong boss fight at the end; killing him rewards €$ 3,000).
V paid Royce with the chip without removing its malware or warning him (Royce will appear as weakened boss fight at the end; killing him rewards €$ 3,000).
V killed Royce during the conversation (yields no extra money, but they will not have to fight him later).
This is the only way to obtain Chaos from Royce (either in the negotiation room or after the boss fight). This is also one of two options that allows V to find and free former Maelstrom leader Brick (see below).

Meeting the Militech operative after fighting Maelstrom[]
After successfully escaping the All Foods Plant, V met a Militech operative at the gates of the plant.
The Militech operative is Meredith Stout if these conditions were met:

V met with Meredith, survived the meeting by answering her questions, which allowed him to proceed to retrieve the Flathead from Maelstrom.
V struck a deal with her and accepted the cred chip.
V did not try to double-cross Meredith by removing the malware from the chip. It does not matter if V copied the malware on the chip as long as the malware is still on the chip.
Meredith reacted impressed and suggested working together again in the future. This is the only way to unlock Venus in Furs, which is initiated in Act 2 when Meredith contacts V again. This will also result in Stout eventually having Anthony Gilchrist killed. Having the Nomad lifepath, V can also expose him as the mole by finding his message to Maelstrom on a computer in a side room of the first larger hall they enter after leaving the initial negotiation room in the All Foods Plant (only as a Nomad V can comprehend the full meaning of the message). They will then be able to explain to Meredith how Militech's convoys in the border area get compromised and how to better protect them, which will cause her to be extra impressed and leave a crate containing Militech equipment as an additional reward at V's Apartment in Act 2.
If V fought Maelstrom but did not meet all the conditions for Meredith to appear at the gate, V is met by Anthony Gilchrist instead, which precludes Venus in Furs.

Saving Brick[]
Paths #3 and #4 allow V to find and free Brick. In order to save him, a laptop on a table in the room to the right of his cell needs to be opened and searched. On it V finds a message ""only you guys know"", which contains the code to Brick's cell door ""9691"". Then, either the detonator device on the table next to his cell door needs to be deactivated (requires Technical Ability skill 11) or V needs to disarm the mine inside the cell themselves. Although he is of no immediate use, Brick will later retake control of Maelstrom (only if Royce is killed during The Pickup), which will allow V to complete Second Conflict in Act 2 without having to fight. Deciding to activate the detonator and killing Brick will instead immediately yield €$ 5,000.

Journal Entry[]
Know what I like about your run-of-the-mill gangoons? They know what they like. Cash, sex, power... maybe just the sight of their enemies' blood. Real rays of sunshine, they are. But these Maelstrom cabrones... shit, never can be sure. They look at you with those creepy-ass toaster faces and you can't get a read of 'em, got no clue what twisted thoughts are racin' through their processors. You ask me, that's why biz with Maelstrom never turns out pleasant. But... sometimes there's just no gettin' around it. Let's grab that spiderbot, yeah? Make Dex proud.
If V met with Meredith Stout:
A Militech corpo-c*** lost an arms shipment, and if she doesn't find it, she'll be paddling up shit-creek with stumps for hands. I'm betting it's not even about the weapons - Militech could lose a tank and it'd make no difference to them. It's about principles. One thing's for damn sure - someone's taking the fall for this.
If V fought alongside Maelstrom:
Every corp has a Gilchrist. First he steals from them, turns a fat profit on the goods, lies about it, narrowly avoids the chopping block, gets rid of all witnesses, makes someone else take the fall from him, and to top it all off - he gets a promotion. Can't help feeling sorry for the Maelstrom gonks in this scenario... but only a little.
If V fought alongside Militech:
Turns out Meredith Stout will do anything to stay in the corp's good graces. Unfortunately that means her ""colleague"" might get demoted... or worse. All in all, Militech recovered their property, putting the Maelstrom freaks in a shittier mood than usual. A day like any other in Night City.

Notes[]
The job was originally named ""Going Pro"" before the game's release, and was split in several sub-objectives: ""The All Food deal"", ""Get the bot from the gang"", ""Escape from the factory"", ""Close the deal with Dex"", and the optional ""Corporate involvement""
The Militech Datashard must be decrypted from the Shards menu in order to receive the 10,000 eurodollars, which can be obtained by interacting with the Hacked Militech Datashard in the Backpack.
Doors will periodically lock behind you as you progress through the All Foods Factory. Once the job is completed, the factory becomes inaccessible.
While all Lifepaths can find the server room and read the messages about Maelstrom's ambush on the Militech convoy, only a Nomad V is able to bring it up during the conversation at the end of the job.
When siding with Militech and neutralizing the Maelstrom presence in the factory, Maelstrom members will periodically ambush V when they are getting into a vehicle in the Watson district. This feature was added in Patch 2.1.

Bairei caused a major mess in Night City sometime ago and fled to the East Coast to wait for the heat to die down, and Padre is just one of many people who want revenge now that he is back in town. The fixer asks V to take out Karubo, but requests it be done quietly, since Karubo's bar is frequented by the Valentinos and the gang is friendly with him.
Per Padre's optional objective, Karubo must be killed or incapacitated and carried out of the bar without the Valentinos inside knowing. Karubo can be found roaming the bar's kitchen, but 1-2 Valentinos are watching the kitchen most of the time, another is watching the front door of the bar, and four others are scattered about the main room. Entering the bar via the front door means alerting the enemies is practically guaranteed unless V is equipped with a Sandevistan with a high time slowdown factor.
With a high level of Technical Ability, you can unlock the back door of the bar, which leads to a small storage room adjacent to the kitchen and bypasses most of these enemies. Once in the storage room, V only has to deal with three witnesses to quietly grab Karubo: a drunk Valentino who is moving around the main room, a Valentino next to the kitchen window who sometimes turns away briefly, and Karubo himself, who moves between four different spots in the kitchen. A netrunner can use Reboot Optics to blind the window Valentino, then sneak up behind Karubo and either kill and dispose of him in the nearby refrigerator, or take him down and drag him out through the back door.
If the back door is not an option, there is a hatch in the bar's roof that leads to a second storage room where one Valentino is taking inventory. The safest way to reach the kitchen and Karubo from there is to systematically kill or knock out every Valentino with a view of the bar and kitchen (one Valentino is sleeping on the bar itself and will not notice anything unless other enemies are alerted, so she can be ignored).
Once Karubo is dealt with, Padre will call. If V incapacitated Karubo without alerting anyone and placed him in the car Padre sent, the fixer is especially pleased and describes how he will savor the solo's punishment.","Enter Karubo's bar.
Neutralize Karubo Bairei.
Neutralize Karubo without raising the alarm.
Carry Karubo's body outside.
Carry Karubo's body to the fixer's transport.
Collect your reward from the Drop Point."
I_Can_See_Clearly_Now,Phantom_Liberty,"A partially hidden S.C.S.M. was being installed and configured at Megabuilding H8.[1] Something seems off about the machine, as it appears to be calling V over. The machine turns out to be an AI by the name of Brendan, and would like you to move over the dumpster that is blocking his view. Moving the dumpster can be completed by passing a Body check (it scales depending on the player level).
After moving the dumpster, Brendan will thank you by dispensing a NiCola and consider V a friend.","Move the dumpster.
Talk to Brendan."
Shot_by_Both_Sides,Phantom_Liberty,"After starting the job, Mr. Hands texts V for them to head to Bree Whitney's Apartment and look for a Militech card located in a safe box underneath a bamboo plant. V finds the Bamboo plant in the bedroom, and retrieves the card. As they leave the apartment, they are confronted by a neighbor of Bree's, who worries for her.
After leaving the apartment, they are instructed once more by Mr. Hands, this time to meet Bree underneath the Kress Street Apartment Building.[N 1]
V tracks down Bree once underground. They can scan footprints to help them track down where Bree is. They find Bree in a cave, and she leads them into Cynosure Site D. After the card doesn't work on one of the doors, an alternative route must be taken. Along this path, the rooms behind the doors Bree opens are trapped with cameras, turrets, and laser mines. The turrets will only be turned on if V is detected by a camera. V must disable these in order to move on.
They eventually get to a control room, where Bree finds videos of Evan McRay's logs at Cynosure Site D about a decade prior. After watching these videos, as they are about to leave, Bree is confronted by Militech agent Dante Caruso. As they talk, V must decide who they want to side with.
If V sides with Bree:
If Dante Caruso is killed, V can loot his Iconic revolver Ol' Reliable. After the conversation with Bree Whitney, her Iconic power pistol Riskit can be picked up from the boxes on the right side of the room. After leaving the laboratory, Hands will call and reward V with €$5,000 for completing the original contract.
However, he will call again about a day later, revealing that Bree was working with NetWatch and sold them the data solely for her personal gain. After another few days pass, a NetWatch hit squad of several agents will randomly appear on the streets and attack V. By that time, that hit squad would also have killed Lisa Smith - one of the remaining scientists who worked in the lab - due to information leaked to them by Bree.
If V sides with Dante:
If Bree is killed (either by V or Dante), V can collect Riskit from the floor. Dante will then share a shard, retrieved from Bree's body. In it is revealed that she was working for NetWatch and was acting solely for her personal gain, facilitating the hit that killed Caesar Mijares, one of the scientists who worked in the lab. If V talks to Dante afterwards, he will also give a €$5,000 reward. Hands will be displeased by this deviation from the contract.
Bree and Dante both die:
If V kills whomever survives the standoff (Bree or Dante), Database: Cynosure Site D can be acquired in addition to both Riskit and Ol' Reliable. Hands will be displeased, although he will be satisfied if V mentions the database shard. After sending it to him through a Drop Point, he will give a €$5,000 reward. Johnny will be disappointed at this choice.","Go to Bree's apartment in Night City.

Riders_on_the_Storm,Phantom_Liberty,"Some time after nabbing Anders Hellman from Kang Tao, a distressed Panam Palmer calls V with a request to come meet with her at the Aldecaldo Camp in Rocky Ridge.
Upon asking her what happened, she tells V that Saul Bright was taken by a group of Wraiths while he and some others were out on patrol, and that they've been observing their camp in Sierra Sonora ever since. Panam asks for V's help in this matter, and promises to give them Mitch's Overwatch in turn.
After agreeing to help, Panam and V make their way to Mitch to get briefed, but instead only find Carol, Cassidy, Teddy, and Bob. Carol tells Panam that Mitch will be back shortly. As V leans on the car, Panam proposes a stealth plan where V sneaks into the Wraiths Camp, while she provides cover from a vantage point. They finish wrapping up the plan as Mitch returns, interrupting the bickering going on between the Aldecaldos.
Mitch proposes that V takes a look at the Wraiths Camp themselves using the drone that Mitch sent flying overhead. Using the drone, V observes the camps gate and perimeter, identifying the camps defenses. While observing, Panam asks V to inspect the tire tracks and the truck, before asking them to inspect the main building where Saul is most likely being kept. Having gathered enough intel, V disconnects from the drone.
Mitch, Panam, and V walk towards Villefort Columbus, in which they plan to approach the camp, but before setting off, Mitch advises that V take a SuperJet with them for when they find Saul. It should help with leading him out of the compound safely.
Upon closing up to the camp, Panam will mention an incoming dust storm, indicating that they have to move quickly if their plan is to succeed. After arriving at the camp and parking the van in a safe spot, V infiltrates the main camp and is able to find Saul in the basement if the main building.
If V took the stealth approach:
Upon exiting the camp with Saul safely, the trio rode off in the van to safety at the Ingalls' Farm, where they spend the night to recover and avoid the dust storm.
If V took the loud approach:
Upon exiting the camp with Saul, the trio rode off in the van chased by Wraiths, which they had to fend off. Due to the dust storm, they managed to reach the Ingalls' Farm safely, where they spend the night to recover.
In the morning, Panam thanks V for their help and gives them the promised Overwatch.

Reported_Crime:_Roadside_Picnic,Phantom_Liberty,,"Go to Nina's hideout.
Find Nina's loot."
Automatic_Love,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Should be written from V's perspective. See our Quest Guidelines]
After meeting with Takemura, you decide to track down Evelyn Parker to find out if she knows anything about the Relic. After optionally calling Judy, head to Lizzie's Bar, and enter her workshop. After a brief conversation with Judy, you discover that she doesn't know where Evelyn is, but she points you in the direction of a dollhouse called Clouds on the 12th floor of Megabuilding H8, where Evelyn used to work. Clouds opens at 5pm, if you came earlier then V will have the option to sit on a nearby bench and wait.
After arriving, you make an appointment to see a doll there, either Angel or Skye, as well as temporarily giving up your weapons while in the facility. Your appointment with Angel or Skye can be cut short by using your safeword, or followed through on an strange soul-search by the doll. Once you use your safeword, you question them for information about Evelyn's location, and they suggest you speak to another doll named Tom in the VIP area. At this point, you have the option to examine booth 11, where the incident that resulted in Evelyn's absence occurred. You can examine a missing port on the wall next to the bed and blood on the wall opposite it. Finally, you can play a recording which shows that the customer did not harm Evelyn, instead, she bugged out in what looks like a remote hack by a netrunner. Some dialogue lines with Johnny are available here.
Entering the VIP area without an access card will cause the Tyger Claws to become hostile towards you, but if you wait outside for a while, a gang member will enter the nearby bathroom where you can stealthily take him out and steal his access card. Alternatively, a shutter in the hallway leading between the main ring of booths and the VIP door leads to an exterior walkway, which can be followed around to a backroom. This same backroom can also be accessed from the bathroom area via a door with a Body 9 requirement to force open. Inside this backroom is a single Tyger Claw, who can be knocked out for an access card, along with an elevator to a backroom in the VIP area, permitting access even without an access card. Guards in the main room will spot you if you linger in front of the glass window too long, but will not comment or stop you if you walk out of the backroom into the VIP lounge.
Once in the VIP area, enter Tom's booth, and he will reveal that Evelyn had an accident there and ended up in a special clinic in Oslo. He suggests speaking to the dolls' caretaker, Woodman, whose office is in a restricted part of the building, so you'll have to disable at least the security camera by the door, and enter when the guards are not watching if you wish to avoid combat. Several side-rooms off the path to Woodman can be explored, including a dressing/prep room for the dolls. On the counter in the first cubby by the door is the iconic katana Cocktail Stick, as well as Evelyn's jacket, which is only a scanable prop that will evoke a comment from Johnny. More information about the accident can be found on the computer in the server room near Woodman's office and on a shard there. You can also find Evelyn's Schedule shard and Evelyn's Handbag in the locker room nearby.
Woodman will not immediately be hostile when you enter his office, but the dialogue you choose during the interrogation can cause him to become so. If you have enough Intelligence, you can offer information on how to better secure their system, or, if you chose the Corpo lifepath, on the real bosses of the Tyger Claws, in exchange for information about what happened to Evelyn. Alternatively, if Gig: Monster Hunt has been completed, Jotaro Shobo's fate can be mentioned and used to intimidate Woodman into giving information. Otherwise, to maintain a peaceful conclusion, you'll need to choose the following:
You don't understand what's at stake.
Let's not make this harder than it has to be.
One way or another, I'll find out...
If Woodman does become hostile, you will instead have to defeat him and learn the information he would've told you by reading a message on his computer. Either way, you will be directed to see a ripperdoc called Fingers on Jig-Jig Street.","Call Judy. [Optional]

Sacrum_Profanum,Phantom_Liberty,"At Cargo Bay, V can encounter a monk who is fully cybered up and in serious distress because of it. After speaking with him, V discovers that he and his brother were taken captive by Maelstrom and he was forcibly installed with Cyberware, which is against the religion that the monks follow. Maelstrom let him go, but his brother is still in captivity.
The monk asks V for help and directs them to a nearby Abandoned Warehouse surrounded by shipping containers. There are several Maelstrom goons that need to be taken out, but the monk wishes for V to avoid killing them.
When you arrive at the warehouse, you spot several possible ways of entry;
A grate on the south side of the building that can be opened with Technical Ability 7.
Climbing the containers at either the northwest or southeast side of the building to sneak past the enemies.
By simply walking inside through the front gate (this method will instantly alert the enemies).
Once inside, neutralize the enemies and approach the monk to speak with and set him free. Note that the monk is a neutral NPC, so he can die if not careful. To the left of the monk there is an Iconic M221 Saratoga called Fenrir.

V must covertly travel through the parade in Japantown, eliminating the snipers that threaten Takemura. A Genjiroh can be found behind a closed door while en route to the second sniper, just after exiting the elevator and before climbing the ladder. The code is 2906. It is also possible to open the door with 20 Technical Ability.
The bossfight against Sandayu Oda automatically triggers once V attempts to disconnect the netrunner. He will rapidly slash at V with blades, every so often running away and camoflaging himself to heal. Upon defeat, the Jinchu-Maru katana can be obtained.
Takemura asks V to spare Oda. Incapacitating Oda will result in him appearing in Totalimmortal and helping you against Yorinobu Arasaka's forces, while killing Oda results in additional dialogue from Takemura being unhappy.","Go to the bazaar in Japantown.

Ex-Factor,Phantom_Liberty,"A few days after helping Judy Álvarez out after Evelyn Parker's suicide, V is contacted by Judy again, and tells them that she has come up with a plan to take revenge on what happened to Evelyn. She tells V that Lizzie's Bar used to be a joyhouse before the Mox took over control, and she plans to do the same with the Tyger Claws owned Clouds in Megabuilding H8. In order to realize this plan, she is eyeing the help from an insider at Clouds, and also also asks V if they are interested in helping her.
If V agrees to help Judy:
V tells Judy that they want to help her, to her relief. She tells V that she first have to get Maiko Maeda—Clouds Manager—on-board with their plan, and if that doesn't work out, they might as well give up. In order to meet with Maiko, Judy proposes that she and V meet up at the balcony by Clouds early in the morning.
Having made their way to the balcony on the 12th floor of the Megabuilding, V waits for Judy's arrival in the early morning. Before breaking into Maiko's office, Judy asks that V lets her do the talking, as they are more accustomed to Maiko's characteristics. She plans on telling Maiko the truth about what happened to Evelyn, hoping that it will be enough to get her on their side. Judy proceeds to open the door by hacking the security systems in a nearby maintenance panel.
Once inside, Judy and V talk with Maiko and explain their plan to take over Clouds from the inside to Maiko, as well as inform her about the heinous acts Woodman performed to Evelyn. Despite what Judy and V tell her, they are unable to bring Maiko on their team.
If V did not kill Oswald Forrest during Automatic Love:
Maiko will tell Judy and V that Woodman is currently taking a break on the maintenance level of the Megabuilding, in case the duo wants to ""talk"" to him about what he has done to Evelyn Parker.
If V agrees to help Judy kill Woodman:

Judy and V take the elevator down to the maintenance level to confront Oswald Forrest. When talking to him, it becomes clear he has no regrets about his actions. The duo then eliminates Woodman there.[N 1]
If V killed Oswald Forrest during Automatic Love:
After leaving Maiko's office, Judy and V talk on the terrace. Judy decides that she will take some time to cool off and give Maiko a call the next day to try again.
Once outside the building, V asks if Maiko and Judy have a history. Judy will proceed to talk about how the two used to be romantically involved, but that it was mainly because Judy was feeling lonely.
After the elevator ride to the ground floor, Judy will tell V that she plans on recruiting some former dolls that worked at clouds, and that she will need to gather more important information to appeal to Maiko. She promises to give V a call when she has more information, before walking off to her car and driving off.
If V tells Judy they think it is a bad idea:
V tells Judy that they think it is a bad idea to try and take over Clouds from the Tyger Claws, and refuses to help Judy.[N 2]","Talk to Judy.

After taking down several thugs, you will find 8ug8ear's room. Once you enter the room, you will find 8ug8ear lying on the netrunner chair.

MaxTac has captured Songbird, so V and Solomon Reed need to break her out.
V will need to call in a favor from a netrunner contact to gain intel on the MaxTac convoy transporting Songbird. Depending on what missions have been previously completed, V can call the following netrunners:
Nix - Delivers V data after 6 hours at the Arasaka Memorial; gives V a frontal cortex implant Self-ICE to aid in fighting MaxTac. Requires completing KOLD MIRAGE with Nix alive.
Sandra Dorsett - Delivers V data after 8 hours at Reconciliation Park; requests V to install a Trojan virus into MaxTac in return. Requires completing Full Disclosure and pick up the Intelligence dialogue option.
Chang-Hoon Nam - Delivers V data after 12 hours at his shop in Japantown; suffers from aphasia after hack and will leave Night City. Requires completing Gig: Wakako's Favorite.
Carol Emeka - Refuses to provide V the data, but sends either a weapon or quick hack to aid in fighting MaxTac. Requires advancing on Panam Palmer's side quests.
Alternatively, V can pay Mr. Hands €$15,000 to enlist his netrunner Yoko Tsuru, who completes the job in 10 hours, and provides an additional objective to send Mr. Hands coordinates of the ambush.
After retrieving the data, V will meet up with Reed and members of the 6th Street gang in an abandoned hotel in Pacifica overlooking a skybridge.
Before the MaxTac convoy arrives, a 6th Street soldier will overview the planned ambush. V can select placement of either turrets or mines, as well as review 3 possible starting positions. At the start of the ambush V, Reed, and supporting 6th Street gang members will need to first eliminate the NCPD escort, followed by a squad of four MaxTac officers.
Songbird will escape with the MaxTac truck. Following the path of the truck leads V to Songbird and directly into the quest Somewhat Damaged.","Call a netrunner to help breach MaxTac.

If Stadium Love is completed using a non-violent approach beforehand, the 6th Street Gang leader, Will Gunner, will recognize V and comment about their gun handling. If a violent approach was taken, he will have less kind things to say about you.
V fights four named MaxTac officers, each matching a different roles: Faye Russo (Assault), Asher Peterson (Mantis Blades), Dallas Foster (Heavy), and Jasper Collins (Netrunner).

After helping the Aldecaldos seize the Militech Basilisk, look around the camp to find Bob checking in on an injured Nomad's condition to learn it's not looking good: Jake Scooter needs a special kidney implant for sickle cell anemia. He'll eventually point V to a pickup location Dakota Smith fixed up to get it, a hospital in Little China.[N 1]
Once near the hospital, head to the back cargo area. There an employee will be waiting with the implant. As soon as you pick it up, he runs off as police suddenly charge in and attack you. You have to defeat them all rather than run away to continue the quest. Once they're all dead, confront the employee who'll reveal the police learned of the deal and stepped in to eliminate you, as they believed Dakota was helping out Raffen Shiv and couldn't tell the difference between them and nomads.
After passing an Intelligence attribute check, V asks if anyone else touched the implant and he'll reveal the police put a virus on the firmware as he hands you the original, and that you'll need to swap the unaffected one to remove the virus. You can then decide to let him go or kill him. If V doesn't qualify for the Intelligence attribute check and lets the contact go, then the contact will call out to V as they're leaving. The contact explains that the NCPD put malware on the kidney, and offers V a shard to remove the malware.
Once done, head back to the camp to give Bob the implant.[N 2]
If V gave Bob the kidney while knowing about the malware:[N 3]
V receives a text message from Bob, asking them to return to the camp. It is revealed that Jake's body accepted the organ, and is recovering steadily from the transplant. Bob will thank V for a job well done and for helping Jake.[N 4]
If V gave Bob the kidney without knowing about the malware:
V receives a text message from Bob, asking them to return to the camp. It is revealed that Jake's body rejected the organ, and has passed away. Bob is sympathetic and does not blame V.","Go to the meeting with the hospital employee.

Just outside Cherry Blossom Market, you will find a man named Stefan proclaiming he has one insane braindance for sale. You can pay him to receive the Unlabeled Braindance; however, you will have to make an additional payment to use a compatible wreath that Stefan has in the building behind him. If you insist on using your own wreath, they can try to run the BD from their inventory but, as Stefan mentioned, the data will be in a older format unreadable the BD set.
Talk to Stefan again where you can either ask for a refund or pay him the additional eddies to use his wreath. If you pay to use his, follow him into the building nearby and activate his rig. Once the braindance starts, you will rapidly lose consciousness. Upon awakening, you will find yourself in a rather familiar location: the bathroom where you found Sandra Dorsett, though this time you're the intended victim. Johnny will waste no time in mocking you for falling for such an obvious trick. You will have no clothes or weapons, although you still have access to your quickhacks and cyberware.
There are about 15 Scavengers scattered throughout the area. Once you've dealt with them as you see fit and retrieved your equipment, which can be found in a locker in the main room, it's time to pay Stefan a visit again. Head back to the market to confront him, and Stefan will try to give a fake excuse while returning the money you paid him. Both dialogue options result in you sparing his life. However, drawing and aiming your weapon at Stefan will trigger another dialogue between V and Stefan, with Stefan begging for his life.","Talk to Stefan.

Immediately following I've Seen That Face Before, V and Alena Xenakis (disguised as the Cassel twins) drive to the stadium. The pair is greeted by Albert Murphy, a Barghest soldier, upon arrival. Murphy escorts V and Alex, informing the pair that Barghest is alerted to a possible FIA operation, and that the pair needs to deposit their weapons in a locker before meeting with Hansen.
During the meeting, Hansen tests the identities of V and Alex. Too many incorrect responses will trigger an immediate game-over. You can use the dossier and knowledge of previous quests for hints on responding. Correct responses will differ depending on which twin V impersonates. Some incorrect responses can be saved with a valid follow-up response or with 20 Cool.
As Aurore Cassel:
When offered a drink, take the drink.
On gambling at the Black Sapphire, answer according to whether the twins won or lost the final bet in You Know My Name.
While in prison, Aurore spent time in the VIP wing, and would not know prisoners from other cell blocks.
Aurore is a fan of Kerry Eurodyne's style.
Aurore is marked for death by France's underworld, so working with them would either be impossible or require a significant payout for the risk.

Aymeric does not remember their time with Petrochem, as their memories for those years were stolen.
After talking with Hansen, Songbird will arrive and lead V to the Neural Matrix. From here, V can help Songbird escape or help Reed capture Songbird. Phantom Liberty's main storyline will branch off depending on V's choice.
V betrays Solomon Reed:
After acquiring the Neural Matrix, it's time to signal Alex to eliminate Hansen. Songbird will breach the stadium, opening your escape route with her providing support via hacks. If you return to Hansen's body, you can loot two of his weapons: Bald Eagle and Wild Dog. Continue and navigate the first area to retrieve V's weapons. Afterward, proceed through the market area. Murphy will arrive - sneak around him or defeat and loot him for the iconic weapon Murphy's Law. Continue working towards the exit, avoiding or fighting a few drones. Once you reach the homeless camp, continue following the prompts until you both drive away, completing the quest and starting The Killing Moon.[N 1]
V betrays Songbird:
After obtaining the Neural Matrix, Songbird will alert Hansen to the ruse. Hansen eliminates Alex, while V's ICEbreaker neutralizes Songbird's attack. Songbird escapes in the ensuing cinematic, creating an opening for V to follow. Navigate the stadium, collecting V's weapons on your way. At the market entrance, Hansen and several Barghest soldiers will ambush V. Hansen starts the fight with his light machine gun and revolver. At 50% health, Hansen switches to a knife and charges V. Defeat Hansen and loot him for his weapons: Bald Eagle, Fang, and Wild Dog. Descend to the parking garage and escape the stadium with Reed.

Kerry was tipped off about a van transporting the group's gear to Night City, and he wants to blow it up before it gets there.
Kerry and V drive to the Red Peaks in the Badlands, on the edge of the city, and stop at a bus stop. Kerry instructs V to get equipment out of the trunk and follow him to lay out the stinger for the van. After they hide at the bus stop, the van runs over the stinger and stops, and Kerry and V force the occupants out of the van. They cooperate and give them the access card to the van, and after V opens the van's rear doors, they let the occupants go.
Once the occupants are set free, V blows up the van using a grenade. After they and Kerry talk more, NCPD sirens are heard in the distance. Kerry and V get into their car and try to escape from the police.
If Kerry and V manage to escape the police and V stays in the car:
After losing the NCPD tail, Kerry instructs V to drop him off on Montenegro street, and offers V coffee at the nearby Capitán Caliente.[N 1]
If V accepts the coffee:

V accepts Kerry's invitation, and they have a coffee at the restaurant. Kerry tells V that he used to have little money left after buying equipment, but that he and Johnny always had something left to visit the place. After the waitress takes their order, Kerry says that the last time he felt like the way he does now was during his last tour and concert, and wonders if their scheme will pay off. After some more talking, Kerry leaves.
After a few minutes, Kerry will text V that he sent them a payment of €$21,470 for their help.
If V declines the coffee:
V declines Kerry's invitation, part ways. Kerry tells V that he will send the payment later and says goodbye.
If Kerry and V escape the police, but V leaves afterwards:

If Kerry and V do not manage to escape the police:
Kerry and V are caught by the NCPD, resulting in V's death after a firefight.
If V leaves without Kerry and causes the job to fail:
If V escapes the area without getting into the vehicle with Kerry, Kerry will angrily text V, telling them that he doesn't have time for their shenanigans. Kerry will not contact V again for any further jobs.[N 2]","Wait for Kerry to call.

Gig:_Fifth_Column,Phantom_Liberty,"When you arrive at the El Pinche Pollo Restaurant, Padre will call and ask that you recover politically incriminating evidence on the interim mayor's advisor, Javier Alvarado, from inside.
The information you need is on a computer in an office on the second floor of the building. Aside from a straightforward assault, there are several ways to recover the evidence without setting off an alarm. If you have completed the side job Heroes, then you can mention Jackie to Ernesto Muñoz, the Valentino guard blocking the stairs. He will take you upstairs to share a drink in Jackie's memory before leaving you with a warning to keep the peace. Warning: walking into the guard can still turn him hostile to you during this event. You can also distract the guard and disable the camera to the left of the bar before going through the door to the back rooms. Be wary of cameras throughout the area.
Regardless of how you obtain the evidence, leave the restaurant premises and Padre will call you, concluding the gig.","Enter the restaurant.

Gig:_Occupational_Hazard,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Write from V's perspective]
This gig is pretty straightforward, with your main concern being taking down a cyberpsycho, Anna Nox, before you can rescue Hal. Anna is equipped with Mantis Blades, so be wary to watch out for those if you decide to fight her head-on. She may also run around the room to a few designated spots, so if you plan to attack her with hacks while remaining hidden, keep that in mind while hiding.
Once she's down, you are safe to look around further. Note: there's a friendly but wounded Mox upstairs who will talk to you briefly about what happened, though if you haven't found Hal yet, she doesn't know specifically where he hid.
If you talk to the wounded Mox before taking out Anna, she will advise to hack into the Moxes' subnet to weaken the cyberpsycho.
Hal has hidden himself in the large blue shipping crate in the same room as the cyberpsycho. If you found the Mox upstairs and ask him about her, he'll note Regina will send someone over to help.","Enter the Mox warehouse.

I_Don%27t_Wanna_Hear_It,Phantom_Liberty,"Some time after blowing up the Us Cracks equipment van, Kerry Eurodyne will contact V, telling them that blowing up the Us Cracks equipment van didn't work, and that their concert is still going to happen. Kerry wants to meet at Riot, a club in Little China, Watson.
If it is before 7:00 pm or after 12:00 am:
V waits on a stool at a stall outside the club until Kerry arrives.
At 7:00pm, Kerry arrives, and talks with V.
If V suggests that they buy tickets:
When V suggests that buy tickets to gain access, Kerry gets annoyed, saying that he doesn't want Us Cracks to get his money.
Kerry and V walk away from the stall and investigate the exterior of the club to find possible ways to enter.
If V and Kerry purchase the tickets off the Fanboys waiting in line:
V and Kerry purchased tickets from a fanboy waiting outside for €$45,000 to gain entrance.[N 1]
If V scans the top VIPs waiting outside:
V encountered two VIP guests on the west side of the club, and scanning them using their Kiroshi's allowed them to obtain two VIP tickets to enter the club after talking with the bouncer.
If V hacks the VIP entrance access panel:
V and Kerry investigate the exterior of the club and find a locked door that V was able to open using their Intelligence.[N 2]
If V and Kerry find the door:
V and Kerry find an open door on the west side of the building. V kicks down the ladder, so that Kerry is able to climb up and join them. After entering through the door, V found an Employee Badge that granted them backstage club access.
Having managed to gain access to the club and going inside, they find their way to the backstage dressing room.
If V has high enough Technical Ability:
V was able to convince the club's huscle that they're a Techie working backstage and gains access to the VIP area. Kerry will ask V how they managed to do that, and V will answer that he used to work backstage for an artist named ""G-Hung"" for a while.
If V and Kerry obtained VIP passes:
V and Kerry gained access to the VIP area after showing their VIP passes to the club's huscle.
V and Kerry manage to find their way backstage, and V follows Kerry to a VIP room where they encounter the three Us Cracks members, Blue Moon, Purple Force and Red Menace, and speak with them.
If V chooses to hear Us Cracks' proposal:
Us Cracks' members will tell about the deal signed with MSM Records. Kerry does not believe it initially, but the members tell Kerry and V that the collaboration wasn't their idea, but that of Kerry's manager, L. B. Kovachek, and that their cover of User Friendly is an expression of their love for him. Kerry will be annoyed with Kovachek, but calms himself down. Johnny comments that Kerry must be blind if he doesn't recognize the girls' potential.
They settle their feud and become friends, and Us Cracks decide to postpone the rest of their tour in disagreement with their contract. The girls request a photo opportunity with Kerry as a souvenir, and ask V to take a photograph.[N 3] After snapping a picture, Kerry will continue to hang out with the girls, while V goes their own way again.
If V chooses to force Us Cracks to stop the deal:
Kerry and the Us Cracks do not come to an agreement.","Meet Kerry at Riot around 7 PM.

Gig:_The_Union_Strikes_Back,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Apply use of {{Condition}}]
This gig involves finding and neutralizing Vic Vega, the head of a private security company called C-Team that hires itself out to corporations to keep employees in line and break up unions. This sounds like a straight-forward assassination, but what Rogue Amendiares does not clearly communicate is that she would prefer that Vega be brought to her alive, and no other guards or workers in the office building that C-Team has rented out should be touched at all.
However, keeping Vega alive isn't a firm requirement to successfully complete the gig. Rogue will complain if anyone other than Vega is incapacitated or killed, and she's unenthusiastic if Vega is killed instead of being knocked out and delivered to her, but the gig's reward remains the same in all outcomes. For the optimal outcome where Rogue is satisfied, V must infiltrate the building's second floor, knock out Vega, and carry the unconscious Vega outside the building to a waiting vehicle. Otherwise, storm the building, kill Vega, and leave to finish the gig quickly.
The building has four points of entry: the front door (distract the receptionist to grab the access key on her desk), a garage with two doors that can be opened with Technical Ability or Body, and an open window on the second floor that can be reached from the roof of the garage. There is also an open window in Vega's office, but this is difficult to reach and Vega is facing it. On the upside, the building has no surveillance cameras or turrets to worry about.
V can enter via the second floor window, sneak into Vega's office and either kill him or take him down. If V takes him down, then the easiest way to get his body out of the building without alerting the guards is to drop out of the office's window while carrying him. The fixer's transport will be a few steps away. Another strategy is to carry him downstairs when the guard patrolling the staircase is out of the way. At the bottom of the stairs is a door on the right to a security office with one guard. It is possible to pass through the security office when the guard is looking away to reach the garage and then exit the building.
Once the gig is completed, Rogue calls to assess V's performance and send the reward. If V completes the mission without killing anyone else, Rogue comments about how the community has suffered enough, so she'll chalk it up as a ""win.""","Get inside C-Team's building.

V learns about the the job by reading the Notice of Expiration shard.
If V has completed Spellbound:
Some time after completing Spellbound, Nix will text V stating he has decrypted the spellbook, and provides coordinates to a location deep in the Municipal Landfill, down the road past Medeski Fuel Station. Alternatively, the quest may be started by simply coming to this location sometime after completing Ghost Town.
The coordinates lead to an old freezer. Open it to find the corpse of Rache Bartmoss, and, after a short dialogue with Johnny Silverhand, scan the freezer and pick up Bartmoss' Cyberdeck.
Head to the Afterlife and show the deck to Nix, who will tell you that Bartmoss was likely killed by NetWatch. He will offer to decrypt the data on the deck, either now or at a later time.
Although he encounters little resistance when he begins accessing the deck, Nix soon trips a hidden piece of malware, and his cyberware begins to malfunction. Johnny reappears, recognizing the malware as a ""brain broiler"" and urging V to do something fast. There are two possible ways to save Nix. You can either override the power panel on the wall next to the door or jack into the computer next to Nix's desk to breach the cyberdeck yourself. The latter option will allow Nix full access to the deck's data, and out of gratitude for saving his life he will reward V with five quickhacks he found: Memory Wipe, Reboot Optics, Short Circuit, Sonic Shock, and System Collapse.","See where the coordinates lead.

The_Heist,Phantom_Liberty,"After V retrieved the flathead from Maelstrom and the information from Evelyn Parker, V is now ready to start the job Dexter DeShawn hired V and Jackie for.
V heads out to The Afterlife to meet up with Jackie and talks to him for a bit before heading into the club. The bouncer will eventually let them in regardless of the option V chooses. As Dex is still busy, V can look around some but ultimately they'll need to go sit down at the bar with Jackie and can talk a bit more with him and the bartender, Claire, before Dex's bodyguard Oleg summons them.
Heist Briefing[]
Follow Jackie to the back room where Dex and T-Bug are waiting to go over the heist's details. V can converse with T-Bug before placing the flathead in the case. Once they do, sit and Dex will begin to ask V some questions, particularly about Evelyn, who V can reveal wanted to cut out the middleman or not. Regardless, Dex will eventually direct them to a shard on the table, take it as Dex and T-Bug continue to fill you in on the plan.
V can ask questions about the mission, then Jackie will bring up how the pay is being split. Dex notes V and Jackie get 30% but V can have him bump it up to 35% if they point out this is about more then eddies, and then that they want to be remembered for something, or, for Corporate Lifepath, that this is about revenge on Arasaka as well. Dex will bump it up to 40% if he is told about Evelyn Parker's desire to cut him out of the deal. After Dex heads off, V can then talk to T-Bug some more before she also heads out. Jackie will then ask if V is ready or not.
Note that once V gets in the cab, they won't be able to return to exploring Night City and finish other missions until Act 2, so if you need to wrap anything else up before then, do it now.
Infiltrating the Hotel[]
Once V is ready, they can put on the suit and get in the taxi. After some banter between Delamain and Jackie, it'll verify V's and Jackie's identity and then drive them to the hotel. On the way, V can talk to Jackie some about how he's acting regarding this job. Once they arrive, follow Jackie once he gets the flathead out and head in through the scanner and then check in. At one point during the convo with the receptionist, they will need to stall her. If V doesn't say anything T-Bug will pose as the receptionist and trick the hotel receptionist. Once the receptionist guides them to the lobby V can continue to the hotel's bar or continue to follow Jackie up the elevator (Jackie will refuse and heads upstairs if you look around).
Once upstairs and in the room, T-Bug will ask V to scan for the entry point for the flathead to use, which is right in the corner between the terrarium and the window. Jackie will command it initially but eventually V will be asked to control the flathead as it got stuck and Jackie's optics can not scan. The flathead fully navigates itself, they just need to tell it where to go, but some rooms V has to interact with objects via the Flathead to progress.
Eventually the flathead reaches the area outside the hotel's netrunner, where V will have to do a mix of scanning a particular object and then manually switch cams to see inside the netrunner's room to find a way for the flathead to get inside. Once it's in, T-Bug needs a few hours to get around their security so go sit and it'll fast forward to night.
When V wakes up, Jackie will be questioning why Yorinobu even tried to leave his family as he could want for nothing under the Arasaka name, but instead tried to start a gang. T-Bug will then note it's time, so head out to the elevator, which will give V and Jackie direct access to the penthouse. While they'll press to make it quick, they can still look around and loot stuff like Yorinobu's attire: Yorinobu's formal shirt, Yorinobu's slacks, and Kōtetsu no Ryū coat, and an Iguana Egg at the terrarium. Once ready, join Jackie and as T-Bug is uploading to it, they will see some unexpected guests arriving by AVs. To make things worse, as Jackie gets the case, T-Bug warns them that Yorinobu is heading too quickly to the penthouse so they will need to hide fast. Head behind the TV screen where she'll open the panel here, and get in.
If V doesn't enter the panel and instead waits for the elevator to arrive:
Adam Smasher will enter taking V down in one shot and then stomping their head as Jackie yells out to them. This event will instantly kill V.
A scene will play out with Yorinobu entering with Adam Smasher before they're unexpectedly joined by his father, Saburo Arasaka and his own bodyguard, Goro Takemura. After dismissing the two bodyguards, things go awry between the son and father and Yorinobu kills Saburo by strangling him to death before initiating a hotel lockdown, claiming someone poisoned his father.
Escaping[]
Taking the elevator is out, so T-Bug will direct V instead to the balcony to try and get to a ladder there. However, just as she gets the doors opened, she's killed on her end. When V gets to the corpse, Jackie will say that his AV should still be on the roof, suggesting to drive it to safety, go to the AV and defeat the two guards, there is some loot inside the AV but unfortunately AV will recognise that there are trespassers and lock itself down. The AV's AI will alert more security leaving them to run to the window T-bug opened. They head out and around and walk across the thin railing to the ladders, but halfway across hostile forces will spot V and Jackie and they will have no choice but to jump. After a short dialogue scene, Jackie will plug the Relic into himself to keep it safe while they both try to escape the hotel.
They will have to go through a number of areas with Arasaka guards. The first elevator they reach won't be accessible as an access token is required. As they reach the second elevator location, they will spot the officer who's carrying it here and they will need to take him out (lethal or non-lethal) to get the token. Once they have it, they access the elevator and can talk a bit before they reach the hotel's lobby area with more guards and if not done stealthily a mech.
Whichever way they manage to get back to the entrance, they take the elevator here to Delamain, which will be under fire, they can ignore the enemies and enter the cab. However, Arasaka sends out Adam Smasher to retrive them and pursue them with three drones, consisting of one Octant and two Griffins. V needs to shoot them down to progress.
After managing to escape, Jackie's injuries prove to be too severe and after he hands the Relic over to V, he dies. Delamain will subsequently ask where V would like to send his remains, and they can choose from several options:
If V chooses to send Jackie's body to his family or tells him to stay put:
This will unlock the sidejob Heroes.
If V chooses to send Jackie's body to Viktor Vektor:
It will later be revealed that Arasaka took the body from Viktor.
After making a decision, V exits the vehicle to go meet Dex inside the No-Tell Motel.
Dex is none too pleased with what happened, as the offing of the emperor is all over the news now. Even if V tells him that it wasn't them and Jackie that did it, Dex will tell them that Arasaka and their ninjas don't know or care about that. He'll eventually agree though that escaping Night City is the best option here before sending V off to go wash the blood off their face. Once they do and leave the bathroom though, his bodyguard knocks them down before Dex shoots them in the head.","Head to The Afterlife.

With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends,Phantom_Liberty,"Some time after helping Panam Palmer rescue the Aldecaldos's leader, Saul Bright, she contacts V again, this time to ask if they are able to come to the Mobile Camp in Rocky Ridge as soon as possible.[N 1][N 2]
After V arrives at the Mobile Camp, they meet with Panam, Mitch, and Saul in the communications trailer. As V approaches them, Panam receives an earful from Saul Bright for calling them over to the camp, and tells Panam once more that he forbade her from even thinking about the Militech convoy that they heard about. Mitch also joins into the argument, calling Saul a fool for letting a Militech Basilisk slip through their fingers. Saul retorts by mentioning that it could mess up the job they came here to do, which is revealed to be a crop protection contract for Biotechnica, with whom he is meeting later.
Panam reveals that they plan on assaulting a Militech convoy that they have heard about in order to obtain a Basilisk from them, which could prove useful for the Aldecaldos, as it could restore some of their reputation as since taking on the Biotechnica contracts they have been going through a rough time. When V asks how they can help out, Panam suggests that they talk to the others–Bob Sagan, Cassidy Righter, Carol Emeka and Teddy Simos–first and walk over to them near the food truck.
After taking a seat, Panam starts explaining the plan to everyone. Panam explains that the Basilisk will be transported on two trucks on Highway 101, and she plans to block the convoy's path by occupying the railroad intersection that crosses the highway.
If V declines to help Panam:
V tells Panam that they don't want to get involved in such a risky job. Despite V declining, the Aldecaldos will continue their plan to try and take over the convoy, and ride off in their vehicles to the train station. Mitch tells V that if they change their mind, they can join them there.
If V decides to join the Aldecaldos at the train station:
V changed their mind and met up with the Aldecaldos at the train station.[N 3]
If V decides to tell Saul[N 4]:
Instead of meeting with the Aldecaldos at the train station, V opted to talk to Saul. V tells them that Panam and co. went on to execute their plan to try and take over the convoy. For their honesty, Saul awards V with 42940 eurodollars.
A few hours later, V is called by an angry Panam, asking them how they could rat her out to Saul, and breaks off contact with V.
A few days later, Saul sends V a text message telling them that they did the right thing by informing him about her plan, and that the entire family owes them a huge debt of gratitude. Saul adds that the contract with Biotechnica did not work out and that the Aldecaldos will be moving their camp soon, with Panam, Mitch and the other veterans already having gone ahead of them. As a parting gift, Saul tells V that they left them something at the Sunset Motel.[N 5]
If V agrees to help Panam:
V agrees to help Panam and goes to the Corp-Bud Railroad Station.
If V decides to travel with Panam:
While driving to the train station with Panam, V talks with her. She notes that Saul probably is in favor of them not being at the Mobile Camp, considering that Biotechnica will be dropping by for a visit. Panam also mentions that Saul is afraid that the Raffen Shiv will attack the Aldecaldos as retaliation for taking the Biotechnica contract from them, and has posted extra security around the camp. When V asks if she misses Night City, she will tell V that she misses the excitement but that she at the same time misses the emptiness of the Badlands. V can understand some of this sentiment and tells Panam about Jackie Welles.
Once the Aldecaldos arrive at the train station and exit their vehicles, they go once more over the plan, and note that all that is necessary to put their plan in motion is to get the old freight train working again. Carol explains that in order to get the train operating, Panam and V will need to override authorization in the control tower.[N 6]
V helps Panam find the entrance to the control tower,[N 7] and together they make their way up to the control room.
Once up high in the tower, Carol tells Panam and V that they have to look for a punch card somewhere in the building in order to gain access to the locomotive's control panel. After finding the Punchcard in a cabinet, V returns to Panam to tell them they have found it, and Carol will instruct them to enter the card into the control panel's reader. After entering the card into the control panel, the locomotive will activate and start moving. Panam will have a heart-to-heart conversation with V, and asks them why they've decided to help her out.[N 8]
After talking with each other, Panam and V join the other Aldecaldos at the campfire near the junction. [N 9] The nomads talk with each other about their current situation and Scorpion, before going to bed.[N 10][N 11]
In the morning, Panam will wake up V and tells them to get in her vehicle, as the Aldecaldos are preparing to start their assault on the Militech convoy. After getting in the vehicle, the Aldecaldos and V ride alongside the locomotive to the railroad crossing on Highway 101 and intercept the convoy. After a firefight, the Aldecaldos manage to secure the Basilisk and escort the trucks back to the camp.[N 12]
Back in the camp, Panam is welcomed by an infuriated Saul, who give each other an earful. Afterwards, Panam instructs the other nomads to get to work on the Basilisk and talks with V, and tells them she will give them a call when she needs more help from them.[N 13]","Talk to Panam.

New_Dawn_Fades,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Not completely following the Manual of Style]
Johnny Silverhand, now in V's body, wakes up in an apartment at the West Wind Apartments in West Wind Estate, Pacifica as they try to get used to their new life. Before heading, he gathers his things and checks an automated text from the North Oak Columbarium, telling him to pay for their order within 24 hours before it'll be cancelled.[N 1]
If you did Knockin' on Heaven's Door following this ending:
Johnny picks up Rogue Amendiares's gun, Pride, off a shelf and apologizes for getting her killed.
Taking a Night City Bus Ticket, he says he's ""Got a bit of time. Think I'll manage to swing by and visit you two."", mentioning that he'll ask Steve for a ride. After Johnny gets his bag and leaves the apartment, he visits a kid Johnny befriended named Steve Sanchez, calling him via his intercom as he comes out of his apartment to greet them (depending on your V's gender).
Johnny can ask about Steve's bruise on his eye, to which Steve responds that his dad beat him for not waking him up in time for work, to which Johnny can comfort them in either option, telling them it happens or offer to give them his alarm clock to him.
Johnny can also ask if they have been improving their skills, to which Steve sheepishly admits he's been botching them, to which you can tell him that he'll get it eventually, or that his technique doesn't matter and he'll find his own flow.
But primarily, Johnny can ask him for a ride to which he'll head out of the apartment. But outside, Henry Sanchez- Steve's Dad, gets mad at Steve for planning to going out on his own, and then attacks him for taking his car keys.
Johnny can tell him to leave Henry alone, play it cool and tell Henry that Steve's just going to be driving him and he'll be back in two hours, or respond aggressively, telling him he'd stay if Steve had a real home and a scumbag of a dad that didn't beat him. Either way, Henry lets you and Steve go and you can hear Henry complain to his friends about the ""terrible influence"" Johnny/V has had on Steve, to which they encourage him to beat him again next time if you stay close to him long enough.
On the car ride to Time Machine, Steve and Johnny talk about Kerry Eurodyne who shopped there one time, discussing about a rumor about Kerry using Johnny's death as a means to get to fame, to which Johnny retorts that ""Can't do much about media vultures. Got shit for brains, 'specially the ones who cover music;"" as well as complimenting Kerry's skills as a musician.
Steve talks about his dream for being a musician, to which Johnny can tell him that he'll need a backup plan so he doesn't get desperate, as well as that being a musician isn't the easiest gig, that hard work and practice are the start- but that it'll get harder and that he'll have to get used to the ""critics, haters, non-stop pressure, batshit crazy lifestyle.."", remarking that it can chew him up. Primarily, Johnny tells him that he's gotta start writing songs and practice, with Steve saying that he doesn't know what to write about. Johnny can tell him that he can write for the people, write with what you know about, or write the truth. Either way, he'll advise Henry that since he's still young, ideas will come as he can give himself enough time.
Arriving at Time Machine, Johnny and Steve get out as they check out the store for a guitar, asking the Owner for a ""Six-string. Electric."" She'll gesture to the nearby wall, to which you can scan three guitars- Anima Rebel, Ardor Session, and Noise Contagion- and Johnny can give his critiques on each of the three, pointing out flaws in the guitars. He tells the Owner that he's looking for ""a real instrument"", and is willing to pay ""real money"".
The Store Owner takes Johnny and Steve to the back, showcasing the newest guitars, with her pointing out the ""vintage axes"" in the back- a Deluze Orphean and Tenzor Paradize. You can ask about either of them, before picking one to test out and tune. He compliments V's playing style, saying that he never knew anyone who could play Silverhand so well and how he read that Silverhand was ""..self-taught."" and ""Made up his own style."" Surprised, he asks how V/Johnny can play so effectively, to which Johnny can either tell him that he is Johnny reborn, which Johnny can choose to explain or not tell him, or to tell him to devote his time and effort into practicing, and he can come up with his own style like Johnny.
Johnny offers Steve the guitar he chose, allowing him to strum a tune as he talked about Rockers being rebels and how they weren't afraid to speak their minds, saying that he tried it once with his dad, mentioning that it didn't end well. Johnny can tell him that being a real rebel means being authentic, or that it needs time to develop. After the conversation, Johnny heads back to the Store Owner and pays 5000€$ (Eurodollars/Eddies) for the guitar, before heading back to the car with Steve as they drive towards the Cemetery.
On the radio, you can hear about Yorinobu abandoning peace talks with Militech as they prepare for an impending war, with Steve asking Johnny if it's likely to happen, to which Johnny can tell him he doesn't care about it, or that there won't be another war.
Steve will talk about a friend of his who lives nearby, saying that he likes driving through the area, to which Johnny can tell him that the city feels alive and it feels like Frankenstein's Monster, and that it's nice to drive through, noting that he never had the time to sit back and appreciate the view as it slipped through his fingers. Steve asks if he's planning to write a song about it, but Johnny responds with a ""maybe.""
Steve can ask about Rogue's gun, complimenting it and mentioning his dad used to sell them, and following up and asked Johnny if he was planning to shoot anyone with it. Johnny can either respond ""Not without a reason."" or ""It's a memento.""
Arriving at the Columbarium, Johnny tells Steve to wait in the car while he pays 4000€$ at the Columbarium for two spots for the next 100 years- one for Rogue and one for V.
For V, Johnny put the Bullet Pendant in the container, saying that he can't hold onto it anymore, thanking him for everything, his epitaph reading ""Dreamer"".[N 2]
For Rogue, he put Pride in the container, saying that she'd still be Queen of the Afterlife if not for him, saying that ""Yeah, we fuckin' got 'em."", and apologizing for dragging her into it and getting her killed, her epitaph reading ""Queen of the Afterlife"".
Leaving the Columbarium and meeting Steve outside, Johnny can take the cigarette out of Steve's hand, saying that he ""Gave all that up. So should you."", saying that ""It's bad for your body. Bad for your soul."" Steve asks what now, to which Johnny can either respond that he can go home or that he's got a bus to catch, to which Steve asks about the friend Johnny visited, noting that he misses her. He responds saying that when his grandpa died, he missed him a lot.
Eventually, Johnny boards the bus and puts in his ticket, loading his bag as he takes a seat and the cinematic plays.
Sitting back before Johnny leaves, Steve urges the bus to stop, saying that Johnny left the guitar he bought. Johnny responds, saying that he can keep it. As the bus pulls away, Johnny takes off their shades as they look out the window and the bus begins to leave Night City once and for all.","Read the notification from the Automated Delivery System.

Gig:_Family_Matters,Phantom_Liberty,"V is instructed by El Capitán to visit the residence of Juliet Horrigan, one of his favorite netrunners. Juliet regularly provides him with stolen data from Zetatech, but she has not been heard from since her last heist two weeks ago. V's priority is retrieving Juliet's latest score, but the fixer is also a little concerned about why she went silent so abruptly.
The Horrigan residence has three entrances. Opening the front door requires a Technical Ability check, and opening the back door requires a Body check, but if you lack sufficient levels in both you can climb onto the front roof and enter through an open window into the upstairs bathroom. Once inside, investigate the first and second floors to find a locked safe, where Juliet's data shard is kept, and traces of something terrible that happened. Upon inspecting the safe, you will be prompted to search for the access key, and by this time there is only one place it could be: the basement. If you have checked the computer near the safe, you can access a surveillance camera in the basement that reveals Juliet has been killed by her sister, Rose Horrigan, who has fallen victim to cyberpsychosis.
Juliet's tragic fate can be surmised from the evidence throughout the house. Her sister Rose had implanted a large amount of cyberware for her job, but she was fired and moved in with Juliet and her husband, Cy. Over time, Rose fell ill and began exhibiting symptoms of cyberpsychosis. Juliet tried to cure her sister by giving her high-end painkillers and antipsychotics, but Rose required larger and larger doses to stay lucid. Juliet even consulted with Viktor Vektor, but Rose was too far gone to help and he could only suggest contacting MaxTac to take her in before she became a danger to everyone around her. After Rose broke Cy's arm, he left for the Sunset Motel for his own safety, but Juliet refused to go with him and continued to care for her sister. A month later, Rose became convinced that Juliet was poisoning her and stabbed her sister in the back.
Rose still wanders the basement of the house, where Juliet's body and the safe access key can be found. V's only option is to neutralize Rose. After retrieving the access key near Juliet's body, V returns to the safe, and opens it to recover the shard.
After V tells El Capitán what happened, he is saddened by Juliet's death, and shocked to learn that she had a sister.","Go to Juliet's home.

To unlock this side job, the player must have completed Push It to the Limit, which acts as the tutorial of sorts. This quest can be initiated upon encountering a random vehicle marked with a blue steering wheel icon (visible both in-game and on the minimap). If one does not enter the vehicle after a certain amount of time, or get far enough away, it will become unmarked as an objective, and one will need to wait for another vehicle to be marked.
The marked vehicle can either be parked and guarded by a handful of hostile guards, or already occupied and moving. In case of the latter, the player must find a way to stop the vehicle from moving or removing the occupants from the vehicle before they can take the vehicle for themselves.
There are three variants of missions available for this side job that can be encountered while exploring Night City:
The first variant will involve a simple delivery of the marked vehicle to the destination, however enemy vehicles will appear that will attempt to kill the player and block their progress. Players must either shake off their pursuers or eliminate them. To shake off the pursuers, players must escape the yellow marked area on the minimap without enemies following.
The second variant has no enemy pursuers but will provide an optional objective of bringing in the vehicle ""in good condition"", i.e. no parts missing or visibly broken.
The third variant has the initial marked vehicle be a modified Mizutani Shion ""Blackbird"", which is equipped with vehicle hacking gear. The player must drive the Blackbird to the actual marked target which will be moving and remain in vicinity of the target until the Blackbird's system can hack it to make the vehicle stop. The target vehicle can then be hijacked and then driven to the destination.
An optional objective can appear in all variants which tasks the player with delivering the vehicle within a set time limit, which will depend on the distance to the location, but range from 90 seconds to five and a half minutes. This time limit objective can also appear on its own.
Once the vehicle has reached its destination, V can leave the car, and then collect their rewards from a nearby marked container. The mission ends upon exiting the garage or parking space the vehicle was parked in.
The rewards the player can receive is dependent on their performance, mainly on the completion of optional objectives and the condition of the vehicle upon arrival, with the maximum Tier depending on the player's level. Rewards included are:
A single Autofixer's Discount Extravaganzzza ticket, which grants a discount on purchasing vehicles from AUTOFIXER terminals. Multiple tickets can be stacked with each other, allowing players to massively reduce the price of buying vehicles.
One or two Weapons depending on performance.
One or two Weapon Attachments.
A Money Shard.
A random Skill Shard (tier dependent on level).
A number of Crafting Materials.
A new vehicle becomes available for purchase each time this mission is completed.","Deliver the vehicle to the indicated location.

This quest is unlocked by hearing the full conversation between Aurore and Aymeric Cassel during I've Seen That Face Before. Once the time comes for V to hack into Aurore to get her codes, the option to download a file called ""Blind_n_Dead"" will appear, which will give the code ""941229"".
Go to the marked area by The Needle, and look for a teal and grey machine with a keypad on it. Enter the code ""941229"", which will open a small door with a duffel bag, where players can find the Rook handgun, a text log, and €$ 8,000.

Things_Done_Changed,Phantom_Liberty,"Two years after accepting Solomon Reed's offer, in 2079, V wakes up from a medically induced coma in Edward Kernaghan Military Medical Center with Reed at their side. Reed explains to V that the operation to remove the relic was successful, but that due to the procedure V's brain became permanently damaged and unable to handle cyberware.
Solomon Reed proceeds to give V a job offer from the NUSA goverment, so that they can at least continue living, and allows V to reach out to their friends.
If V calls Viktor Vektor:
Viktor Vektor is happy to hear from V, and V shares their diagnosis with the ripper. Vik will say the doctors are wrong, and the merc should pay him a visit.
If V calls Judy Álvarez:
Judy Álvarez is surprised to hear from V but will admit her relief to know they're alive, also stating she won't be part of their next adventure as she is now living in Pittsburgh and married to a woman named Bianca.
If V romanced Judy:
Judy will also apologize to V and ask her not to try and ruin their marriage, effectively ending their relationship.
If V calls Panam Palmer:
Panam won't answer the call, and V leaves her a phone message. Mitch Anderson sends V a video message during the epilogue saying she doesn't want to talk to them, and that it would be best if V does not try to call her again. If V romanced her, the relationship is ended.
If V calls River Ward:
River Ward is angry at first, but gives V a chance to explain that they just woke up from two years of coma, after which River apologizes. After suggesting meeting up, River reveals that he sold everything he knew about the NCPD to Trauma Team to earn some money to pay for Randy's rehab, and as a consequence, he is now a wanted man. Ashamed of himself, he's unable to face V in person and ends the call. If romanced, the relationship is ended.
If V calls Kerry Eurodyne:
Kerry Eurodyne is happy to hear from V but is also busy and constantly interrupted during his call as he's at the Crystal Palace on a concert tour, admitting that he doesn't have time for V at the moment. If romanced, he promises to reunite with V once the tour is over in a few months.
Afterwards, V returns to Night City and takes a Delamain cab to Viktor's clinic (which is now a Zetatech franchise), having opportunities to talk with those two about what has changed in Night City. Viktor will also concur with the NUSA doctors, stating that V's motor cortex appears to have ""turned deaf to implant signals"".
After leaving Viktor's, V is accosted and beaten by a single street thug, a sad reminder of how weak they've become. Misty Olszewski arrives and helps V up. She shares that she is moving to Poland, and gives V advice on living as an average citizen. V can express various outlooks on their life and goals.

After speaking with Nancy Hartley's assistant Steven about her whereabouts, Johnny tells V to travel to the Totentanz.
When V arrives at the club, and after they travel to the third floor and go to the proper entrance to the club, the Maelstrom guards recognize V from an earlier job.

If Brick was freed during The Pickup:

Regardless of the outcome, V and Nancy are soon dismissed. Nancy leads V to her car, saying that V will have to come along with her to talk. While they walk to Nancy's car, and while driving, V convinces Nancy to join Kerry Eurodyne's gig for a Samurai reunion.
After V leaves Nancy, V is told to head to Denny's Mansion to meet with her and Henry. When they arrive, the gate will be locked, and the intercom will not be picked up, forcing V to trespass onto the property.
While looking for Denny and Henry, V comes upon a scene in Denny's backyard. Henry had driven a cement truck into Denny's yard and dumped cement into the pool, and the two are arguing about it. Kerry is standing to the side, and when V confronts Denny and Henry, they are forced to choose between the two for the gig, with the other being replaced. If V consults Johnny, he will not have a preference, saying that Denny is a control freak and Henry can't be trusted.

Gig:_Scrolls_before_Swine,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Rewrite from V's perspective, use of {{Condition}}]
The task is to retrieve a video file from a warehouse that NCPD officer Aaron McCarlson claims is a Maelstrom torture den. The warehouse is guarded by a total of six gang members: three outside, and three inside. The computer holding the file is in a room on the second floor and can be reached either through an open hatch in the rooftop, or by entering through any of the building's doors and going up the stairs.
Before retrieving the file from the computer, V can view the video itself in the ""FILES"" tab (note: the file will be removed from the computer when you steal the data). It is a short, looping clip that shows Aaron murdering a woman in the alley behind the warehouse. Watching the video will cause Johnny Silverhand to react with disgust at Aaron's actions, and an optional objective will appear to tell Aaron that V knows what is on the video. Leave the premises once the file has been downloaded.
Now head to Aaron's apartment, which is on the second floor of a small apartment building just north of the Longshore North fast travel point. Interact with the ""call"" button to the left of the door to summon Aaron. If V managed to swipe the file without alerting any of the Maelstrom gang members, Aaron will compliment V on their skills. At this point, V can hand over the file and then exit the building to complete the gig. Regina will wire payment and mention that gaining Aaron's trust means she can take advantage of his NCPD connections.
If V informs Aaron about their knowledge of his deception, there is an extra decision to make. On the one hand, Aaron can be extorted to pay double the money, which concludes the contract successfully, but earns the scathing disapproval of Johnny. On the other hand, V can declare that they want Aaron to go to jail for his crime, which turns him hostile and forces V to fight him, delighting Johnny. If Aaron is killed, Regina will call to say that she understands why V took out Aaron, but criticizes it as a wasteful move since he wielded huge influence inside the NCPD and V had leverage over him. The client being dead also means neither Regina nor V get paid. Alternatively, if V manages to knock Aaron down without killing him, Regina will comment on the turn of events and will be pleased as she can now use Aaron, once he wakes up, as her asset inside the NCPD.","Get inside the warehouse.

(Don%27t_Fear)_The_Reaper,Phantom_Liberty,"In order to unlock this ending, players are required to make specific choices at the end of Chippin' In. In order to succeed in this quest, reaching somewhere near maximum level is recommended before attempting.
On the rooftop towards the end of Nocturne Op55N1, V needs to be indecisive in making a decision on who to call for help. After about five minutes of doing nothing and simply leaving the dialog choice open, Johnny will comment that it is tough to decide who ""will die for you"", and proposes they enter Arasaka Tower alone―making this a suicide mission. This echoes Dexter DeShawn's question in the beginning:
""Would you rather live in peace as Mr. Nobody... or go down for all times in a blaze of glory?""
Two factors make this mission uniquely difficult:
Saving is not allowed throughout the entire mission. However, the game still autosaves at checkpoints, the first being at the start of the mission, the second after descending to the mainframe level, and the third immediately before the confrontation with Adam Smasher.
V's max Health will be lowered by 25% at the start of the mission, and gradually decreases by an additional 1% at certain intervals, indicated by the ""Relic Malfunction Detected"" notification. The longer it takes to complete the mission, the harder it gets to survive.
A level in the mid-40s or higher as well as good equipment is therefore advisable.
Dying at any point will result in a credit roll, which will prompt video messages identical to the ""easy way out""/suicide ending. Although the game will not offer to ""load last save"" and cut to credits instantly, it can be resumed from the autosave points mentioned above.
Choosing Johnny's ""suicide run"" option will result in an immediate cut right to the front entrance of Arasaka Tower. In the entrance area, V will have to fight two Arasaka Samurais and three Arasaka Special Agents who are all at maximum level. After defeating the guards along with two Arasaka mechs, Johnny leads V to the elevator for which an access token is needed. More guards will spawn and they will have to be defeated in order for the token to be looted. As V obtains the access token, they will have to call for the lift, which will only arrive after a significant amount of time, leaving V in the lobby having to defend against guards that will spawn from time to time, including Juggernauts - their Mk.31 HMGs will prove very useful, and by the time you run out of ammo, another juggernaut will have appeared. It is advisable to retreat to the entrance area and fight the guards from there as they will enter the elevator area from two sides. Using a wall-penetrating Tech Sniper Rifle like the Tsunami Nekomata can make the fights here and throughout the mission decisively easier. Enter the elevator immediately after the door opens, and select the Netrunner floor. Another Mech will spawn in front of the elevator before its doors close. The Short Circuit quickhack is a good way to quickly and effectively deal with the Mechs throughout this mission.
There are very few advantageous locations from which to fight multiple enemies after reaching the elevator. It is advised to bring the best guns and armor and stock up on ammo and meds before proceeding, but these can also be crafted between combat (and in the elevator). Enemies spawn as V reaches certain checkpoints, and therefore it is difficult to hide and pick them off. Your final enemy will be Adam Smasher, who will summon reinforcements at preset points during the fight: 6 Arasaka Snipers appear on the balcony around the room and three Juggernauts on the ground level.
Once Alt is successfully uploaded to the access point and is connected to Mikoshi, she will offer V a choice to either give their body to Johnny, or to keep it. Choosing Johnny results in the New Dawn Fades (Temperance) ending, whereas choosing V will result in the Path of Glory (The Sun) ending, albeit modified by the fact that Rogue is still alive in both.","Find a way to the level with Mikoshi.

Gun_Music,Phantom_Liberty,"Shortly after V and Panam Palmer rescued Saul Bright from the Wraiths Camp, the other Aldecaldos—Cassidy, Carol, and Teddy—went into Night City to deliver cyberware to a group of Scavengers.
Upon approaching the location at an industrial complex on Martin Luther King Boulevard and Valley street in Arroyo, Santo Domingo, V is stopped by Aldecaldo Taco and informed about the situation.
Intent on helping the Aldecaldos, V goes to see what is going on and interrupts the conversation between the Aldecaldos and the leader of the Scavengers, who is complaining that the delivery of cyberware was three days later than intended. The Aldecaldos reason that this was due to the dust storm that passed a few days ago.
As V talks with them, the Scavenger leader will agree to a percentage cut, but realizes that V participated in shooting up the Scavenger Den. With sufficient Body, you can intimidate the scavengers to resolve the deal peacefully and pay the Aldecaldos. Otherwise a gunfight will break out; Carol will be displeased by this outcome.
If V has high a enough Body attribute:
V was able to intimidate the Scavengers and have them make the deal with the Aldecaldos. The Aldecaldos thank V for their help before returning to the Mobile Camp.
If V started a fight:
A gunfight broke out during the conversation, causing the Scavengers to engage V and the Aldecaldos. After the gunfight, Carol will be angry with V, but Cassidiy will reason with her. The Aldecaldos thank V for helping before returning to the Mobile Camp.","See what's going on.

Notes[]
If V is male and initiated this side job before Queen of the Highway, Cassidy will write him a text message concerning Panam some time after completing the job.[1]
V can covertly kill the entire Scavenger team except Roman before the negotiation dialogue has even ended. The leader will act as if they are still alive.
Taco and his twin brother Jeff can be approached at the Mobile Camp after this job, where they will both thank V for their help.

Approach[]
This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝
Two of Placide's sentries can be found near the Grand Imperial Mall standing by an old vehicle. Upon speaking to them they will direct V to enter the mall via the garage.
The Garage[]
This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝
There are about three Animals enemies standing directly in the garage entryway and a further five further inside the entry way, two of which will leave the complex and the other three are grouped together in the left corner. In order to avoid the first three, head down the right hand side of the ramp, hop over the low wall bordering the ramp, and then keep as close as possible to the building until reaching the first two on the motorcycles, then wait for them to depart then simply walk along the right wall to avoid being seen by the group of three on the left.
The Atrium[]
Placide will warn V before entering the atrium.
The atrium is a large open space on the lower level, with a gallery surrounding it on the upper level. There are around six Animals in the gallery, and 12-18 more on the lower floor, along with a turret.
Enter the atrium in one corner of the gallery. The van, which is the objective, is parked roughly in the middle of the far side, on the lower floor. Immediately in front of V upon entering are a pair of escalators down to the lower floor.
This takes V to a side room on the lower level. If V exit this side room V will soon reach another side room which can be entered. In this room is a server which is connected by a thick cable to the van, which is parked just outside another entrance to this room.
There are three Animals standing immediately outside this second entrance by the van, who are on high alert.
Move around this room to the corner immediately behind this van. Through a glass window here, one can see the left hand side of the van where V need to jack in, but no way was found of breaking the glass in this window without attracting attention.
The Van[]
When jacking into the computer system in the van, V will discover that the NetWatch netrunner is in the cinema on the upper level. Unfortunately, this will also make him aware of V's presence.
The Cinema[]
This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝
V proceeds up to the cinema. If V fought in the atrium, Placide will open a route to it. Following this route, there is one opponent at the top of the escalator going up, Then go round a corner to the movie theater entrance where Sasquatch is keeping guard.
If an alert had been triggered or V are detected by an Animal in the Grand Imperial Mall before, the Netrunner will have preemptively shut the gates to the movie theater and Sasquatch will be waiting for V. Sasquatch will attempt to rush at them and attack with her signature hammer, her attacks are powerful but slow, and will take several seconds between each swing.
However, if V remained undetected throughout the GIM, the gates to the movie theater remain open and it is possible to sneak past Sasquatch without a fight. Being detected by her causes the gates to automatically close and the fight will proceed normally.
While V are fighting with Sasquatch, the Netrunner is trying to spike V's brain and kill them, but with Placide's help, he cannot kill V immediately. V should defeat Sasquatch quickly before the Netrunner manages to kill them. The weakness of Sasquatch is a shining implant on her back, once V destroy the implant, she will get hurt significantly and can no longer recover her health level.
Once Sasquatch is defeated, V finds the NetWatch netrunner Bryce Mosley, in the projection room. He will tell V that the Voodoo Boys are planning to double-cross V. One can choose either to side with him and have the virus removed (and thus prevent the breach of the Blackwall) or knock him out, in which case the virus that Placide uploaded to V earlier will wipe out many Netwatch facilities across the continent, and attempt to kill V as well.
Back to Batty's Hotel[]
After exiting the Mall, Placide's sentries will be waiting outside. They will be shocked to see that V have survived, and nervously offer to take V back to Placide, which can be accepted or declined.
Once in Batty's Hotel, talk to Placide and Brigitte.","Leave Batty's Hotel.
Meet with Placide's people.
Enter the mall.
Find the van in the lobby.
Reach the van.
Deal with the enemies near the van (if hostile approach).
Connect to the van.
Talk to Placide.
Find the agent in the cinema.
Deal with Sasquatch (optional if sneaking).
Confront the agent.
If V knocked Bryce Mosley out:
Jack into the agent.

Talk to the agent.
Take the shard.
Talk to Johnny (if not making a deal with the agent).
Leave the Grand Imperial Mall.
Talk to Placide.
Head to Batty's Hotel.
Get into the back seat. [Optional]
Talk to the guards (if ride not taken).
Meet with Placide in Batty's Hotel.
Talk to Placide.
Talk to Brigitte.
Notes[]
During the dialogue between Brigitte and Placide, they conclude if V is a ""ranyon""[1] or not[2], based on the scans Placide did on V.
The dialogue depends on whether or not V accepted the deal with the NetWatch agent. If so, Placide will call V a ""normal, filthy ranyon""; otherwise, Brigitte will defend V as being ""no ranyon"".
""Ranyon"" is Haitian Creole for ""rag"" or ""floor rag"", as the agent says, meaning ""useful disposable outsider"".
Trivia[]
The title of the job comes from the Johnny Cash song, I Walk the Line.
The movie projected on the screen in the cinema where V confront the NetWatch agent is One-Eyed Jacks, a western from 1961.
References[]


↑ Placide: ""I know. I scanned him/her. Only a normal, filthy ranyon.""/""He/She is ranyon. Nothing special. V see de scans.""

↑ Placide: ""But V saw--"" Brigitte: ""Yes. But I also saw his/her scans. He/She is no ranyon.""

Gig:_A_Lack_of_Empathy,Phantom_Liberty,"This gig requires you to enter a club called Empathy, which has a whole lot of Animals around the place. If you enter through the main scanner (to the left after walking in the front door), one of the guards will stop you, telling you to check your weapons in the container. If you want to avoid a fight in the entire club (which is one of the optional objectives in this mission), you have to deposit your weapons. Alternatively, you can enter through a door to the right of the entrance room, navigating through a set of private backrooms with several hackable computers before entering the club proper without relinquishing your weapons.
Once you are in the club proper, head through until you reach an area called ""Private"", which leads upstairs to the computer room where you need to go to upload the malware. You will need to sneak past one of the Animals guards on duty, and you do not want to let him spot you. Sneak up to the computer room beyond, and you will see another Animals guard with his back turned to you. Either take him out however you wish and stuff his body in the nearby container, or just upload the malware.
Once you've uploaded the malware, it's time to delta out of there. You can do this in one of two ways. You can either retrace your steps and head back the way you came, collecting your weapons before you go, or you can slip out the back door of the computer room where you can drop into the lot below. This will fulfill the ""Leave the club"" objective, after which you can circle around the building before heading back into the entrance and retrieving your gear again. Once that's done, all you need to do is head for the drop point to complete the gig.","Enter the ""Empathy"" club.

After completing Ghost Town and reaching 40 Street Cred, an undiscovered quest will appear some time after on your map, in the same tunnels where Nash's Raffen Shiv hideout was. The quest starts automatically once you visit the location, where you come across an odd sight: among the darkness and crags of the unfinished tunnel, in an old shipping container, is a jet black Rayfield Caliburn ""Murkmobile"", along with several containers and amenities that imply someone set up shop here or at least intended to do so. A quick search in a nearby container reveals the story. A young man, orphaned by the murder of his parents, resolved himself to become a vigilante, a creature of the night dedicated to fighting the darkness of the city from within the darkness: Murk Man. Unfortunately, Murk Man seems to have abandoned his hideout or, possibly, was killed by the very criminals he had hoped to fight. Still, every vigilante needs a nice ride--hence the Caliburn. And if Murk Man isn't around to make good use of it, you may as well in his stead.","Search the container.

The_Information,Phantom_Liberty,"This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝
After V spoke with Dexter DeShawn, they were sent to Lizzie's Bar on the corner of Kennedy Avenue and Sutter Street to get in touch with the client, Evelyn Parker.
Once inside the bar—between 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM—V approaches the bar and asks the bartender, Mateo Thiago, about Evelyn's whereabouts. As V approaches the bar, Evelyn is sitting on a barstool with Judy leaning next to her, but V doesn't know who they are yet. Mateo refuses to provide any information, and Judy leaves offscreen during that conversation. Evelyn, who was awaiting V's arrival, interrupts their conversation, and introduces herself to V as Mateo pours a drink for them. Evelyn will proceed to ask V to follow her to a more secluded VIP room.
In the VIP room, Evelyn briefly interrogates V about their relationship with Dexter DeShawn, after which she explains her unique gig and its attached strings. Evelyn tells V that the Arasaka biochip called the Relic is in a secure location inside Konpeki Plaza in penthouse. The penthouse is occupied by Saburo Arasaka's son and heir Yorinobu Arasaka, who recently arrived in Night City. Evelyn proceeds to explain that Yorinobu stole the biochip from an Arasaka laboratory, and intends to make a deal with NetWatch in order to sell it. Evelyn reveals that she has scrolled a braindance of Yorinobu's penthouse while she was there as Yorinobu's personal joytoy, as V and Evelyn move further inside Lizzie's Bar towards the workshop. While heading down to the basement, Evelyn tells V about Judy Álvarez and warns V to behave themselves.
Once in Judy's workshop, Evelyn introduces V to Judy, who was just finishing up compiling the Konpeki Plaza braindance. If V has high enough Technical Ability, they can have a short side conversation about Judy's tech setup before Evelyn interrupts. Judy instructs V to sit down in the chair nearby, after which she places the Braindance Wreath on V. Judy returns to her desk to calibrate V's sensory profile and then prepares V for the calibration braindance.
During the calibration braindance, V re-experiences the last minutes of a low-life Scavenger that robbed a Cali Express. The Scavenger was shot and killed by his compatriot, upon which the braindance ends and calibration finishes.
Having exited the calibration braindance, V needs a moment to catch their breath and is unsure if they want to continue. Evelyn reminds them of the importance of the next braindance and that it's crucial for the gig. Convinced by Evelyn's words, V tells Judy that they need to involve the Netrunner T-Bug as well, so that she can study the security of Konpeki Plaza.
Judy resists allowing T-Bug to link in, but Evelyn convinces her to allow it, reassuring Judy that she'd never let harm come to her. T-Bug and V navigate the braindance of Yorinobu's suite, where they identify high-tech security systems and a temperature-controlled vault that contains the Relic. T-Bug is sure that she can override the security systems, and she points out the gun that Yorinobu keeps in the suite, saying that V should keep it in mind.
After V exits the braindance, Judy scrubs V's profile from her system. She's worried that Evelyn and V will get killed, and that if Arasaka finds out about the braindance, they'll kill everyone involved. V and Evelyn reassure Judy, and then Judy tells V to keep the braindance wreath. Before leaving Judy's workshop, V can optionally have a brief conversation with Judy to thank her or express interest in seeing her again.
Before V leaves the basement, Evelyn wants to talk, and V can ask several probing questions about the job and Evelyn's relationship with Yorinobu. Evelyn then asks V to do the job just for her, without including Dex. V protests that hazing Dex will ruin them, but Evelyn dismisses the concern. V can refuse or say that they'll think about it. Evelyn says that she needs to talk Judy, and V is directed to leave Lizzie's.","Go to Lizzie's Bar between 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM.

Notes[]
The robbed shop featured in the calibration braindance is a Cali Express located in The Glen. It is the food vendor found between fast travel points Ventura & Skyline and Metro: Glen South. Speaking to the vendor will give V the option to comment on the smell of chlorine, to which the vendor will reply about having to clean up ""[a] few stains that wouldn't come out"", referencing the robbery and murder seen on the braindance.
Trivia[]
The Information is a 1998 song by Course of Empire, from the soundtrack of the film, Dark City.

Bob Sagan, Carol Emeka and Teddy Simos (sitting at a table towards the west end of the camp)

Cassidy Righter (shooting at empty bottles at the southeast end of the camp)
V can join Cassidy's target practice; hitting 12 or more bottles prompts him to offer V his revolver, Amnesty. It is advisable to crouch and aim before Cassidy gives the go.
If their respective missions were successfully completed, additional characters can be found around the camp and need to be talked to for the optional objective (other than Jake, their respective dialogs are the same as before this mission):
Jake Scooter from Fortunate Son (playing guitar on a couch by the large camp fire; see also Trivia)
Benedict McAdams from Gig: MIA (leaning by the stairs up the food truck)
Bruce Welby from Gig: Goodbye, Night City (sitting on a chair outside the weapon's dealer tent)
Anna Hamill from Gig: Woman of La Mancha (leaning by the water truck at the western edge of the camp only if V is a Nomad and convinced her to join a clan)

Gig:_Bring_Me_the_Head_of_Gustavo_Orta,Phantom_Liberty,"V is contracted to assassinate Gustavo Orta, a high-ranking Valentino, after his girlfriend Martha Frakes, the daughter of 6th Street member Nolan Frakes, was shot and put into a coma. Nolan blamed Gustavo and reached out to Padre to exact justice for his daughter. At Gustavo's apartment building, take the elevator to the 32nd floor. The hallway area outside Gustavo's apartment has some points of interest. First is a neutral surveillance camera that is linked to two more cameras inside Gustavo's apartment, which should be helpful for stealthy netrunners to scope out the interior. Second is a utility closet that can be unlocked with 9 Technical Ability to reveal a small trove of loot. Third is the entrance to Gustavo's apartment, which can only be opened with 17 Body or by quickhacking the keypad to the door's left; be warned that prying open the door will instantly alert all of the apartment's occupants. Lastly is a large shutter that opens onto a narrow catwalk outside the building, from which V can reach the lower and upper balconies of the apartment.
To carry out the hit, reach Gustavo Orta in his office on the apartment's second floor. Gustavo can either be killed or incapacitated and carried to a car waiting outside to complete the gig.
Alternatively, the gig can be completed nonviolently, either by jumping onto the upper balcony and sneaking into Gustavo's office, or by ringing the doorbell and answering correctly with the Streetkid (Lifepath) (the guard opening the door for V will point out that Gustavo is upstairs). If V has not harmed anyone in the apartment or been noticed, Gustavo will engage V in conversation and explain the circumstances of Martha's injury. Martha disliked her father and ran away from him to be with Gustavo. Later, Gustavo's car was ambushed by 6th Street when he was with Martha. During the ensuing shootout, Gustavo survived unscathed, but Martha was caught in the crossfire. Nolan did not truly care about his daughter, but hated Gustavo for taking her from him and used her injury as justification to have Gustavo killed. V can choose to spare Gustavo by telling him to leave Night City. He is reluctant to abandon Martha, but agrees to go when V points out that Martha will never be safe as long as she is together with him. He gives V safe passage out of his apartment (If V attempts to read any computers or hack any access points in the apartment while being watched by Gustavo and or his henchmen, they will turn hostile. However, if V hacks an access point unnoticed, they will not turn hostile). Exit the building and head to the dropbox to receive payment. Padre then calls to inform V that Gustavo committed suicide, but he assumes that V somehow made Gustavo do it and is impressed by the feat. V can then return to Gustavo's apartment to loot his body for a note and other items.","Go to Gustavo's apartment.

Reported_Crime:_Welcome_to_Night_City,Phantom_Liberty,,"Go to the garage on Manzanita St.
Loot the stash."
Somewhat_Damaged,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Walkthrough needs to be rewritten from V's perspective, removal of bullet points and pseudo-headers]
Search for Songbird
From the hole in the wall, head down to the crashed MaxTac truck. Searching the truck reveals traces of the Blackwall, which acts as a trail to Songbird. To continue following the traces, V will need to force open two sealed gates (20 Body Attribute check) or bypass them by finding a floor exit panel and swimming through flooded passageways. V can briefly chat with Johnny Silverhand before plunging down a deep shaft. Exit the water, and continue following the Blackwall traces until V reaches a room with a terminal and Cynosure logo, marking the outskirts of the Cynosure Facility. Jack in to trigger a conversation with Reed. Johnny will add some comments based on whether the player has completed Shot by Both Sides or not. Songbird will cut off communication before talking with V as well.
Descend Deeper into the Cynosure Facility
Use the elevator to descend further down. Songbird will sever communication with Johnny, leaving V to continue alone. Proceed through the facility until V sees a ""memory"" of Songbird talking with Hansen, followed by a brief conversation with Songbird. Next to the terminal where the two are speaking, you can find a Site Map of the facility, which can be toggled like the dossiers in Firestarter. Afterwards, V must force open a door (Body Attribute check).
Bypass the Lockdown
Continue onward until you see Songbird, standing just past the gateway to a new area. If approached, Songbird will close the entry gate and initiate a lockdown protocol preventing V from reaching her. To continue, V must deactivate the lockdown by disabling data terminals Alpha and Bravo.
Disable Alpha: Enter the Server Room with a Body Attribute check to force open the closed shutters. Then, jack into terminal Alpha using your personal link and complete a Breach Protocol.
Disable Bravo: After disabling Alpha, the floor exit gate in this room will open. Drop down and proceed until you take a ladder up to terminal Bravo. Once again, jack in with your personal link. Songbird will prevent your hacking attempts, but scanning the terminal will reveal power cables. Crawl under the terminal to unplug and disable Bravo.
Escape Cerberus
As V crawls from under Bravo, a ceiling grate will fall onto V, followed by a Militech Cerberus controlled by Songbird. Remove the grate, then watch a brief scripted sequence before regaining control of V. Run away from Cerberus into the only open room. On the left is an open floor exit panel V can use to hide. Drop through the opening, then continue until you reach a ladder that takes V to the Living Quarters. Another copy of the Site Map can be found on a bed. The next room has another ""memory"" of Songbird undergoing surgery by the FIA.
Failing to remove the grate in time or getting caught by Cerberus will result in a game over.
Before dropping down the floor exit, another Site Map shard can be found by the computers.
Cerberus will now hunt V throughout Cynosure. Use the Gameplay Tips below for help surviving.
Reach Engineering and Disable Sierra
V's next destination is Engineering. Either exit through the door directly across from Engineering with a Body Attribute check, or exit through the doors across from Administration, go right then right again at the hallway intersection. Enter Engineering, and to V's right is the room housing terminal Sierra. To disable, jack in with V's personal link and complete a Breach Protocol. This will alert Cerberus to V's location; once it is safe, leave Engineering and move on to the next terminal.
Reach Security and Disable Victor
V's next destination is Security. Exit Engineering, go right until the hallways intersect, then right again towards the Sector 3 gate. Security will be the second door on the left. This first room has a Site Map shard, and the second has an area V can use to hide on the left. Continue to the final room with terminal Victor. To disable, jack in with V's personal link and complete a Breach Protocol. As you leave Security, V will see another ""memory"" of Songbird standing after her surgery. Now on to the gate.
Obtain Erebus Crafting Specs (Optional)
Across from the entrance to Engineering is Maintenance, but the door panel is disabled. Turn left, enter the Storage Area, and head to the back room. On the wall is a Distribution Box V can rewire using their Technical Ability, powering the door panel. Return to the door panel and enter Maintenance; the Erebus crafting specs will be directly ahead. V can leave through the doors, or take the ladders up to the ceiling vents. Heading through the vent lets V can drop down into Section 3, just past the gate.
Exiting via the vents will lock V out of the previous area but also bypasses disabling Sierra and Victor.
Open the Gate and Proceed to Sector 3
Interact with the terminal and wait for the gate to unseal. Head into Section 3, and soon V will need to run from Cerberus. Flee down the only path forward until V reaches an airlock door. Enter then close the door behind V, and wait for the airlock to cycle. Once V can continue, proceed to the next airlock and another ""memory"" of Myers and Songbird taking the oath. Leave once the airlock cycles and continue following the Blackwall traces to Core Control.
Shutdown the Core
Talk with Songbird, then interact with the terminal and initiate a shutdown of the core. Three subsystems remain online and require manual shutdown. Turn around to leave and see another ""memory"" of Reed talking with Songbird. Next, head into Labs.
Neural Network: Enter Labs, and the Neural Network Room is to V's left, with the entrance across from another ""memory"" of Songbird. Once inside, find and unplug 3 cables connected to the subsystem. Cerberus will arrive and resume hunting V.
Datafront Central Command: Instead of heading left, head forward and enter the Observation Room. To the left is the door to the 1st room of Datafront Central Command, followed by the 2nd room and 3rd room. V will need to destroy 6 firewall devices to disable the subsystem. 2 are located in the 1st room and 4 are in the 3rd. Each time you destroy a firewall device Cerberus will come down from one of three vents and hunt V. The three vents are located in the 1st and 3rd room, and one outside of the Datafront Central Command entrance.
Thermic Control: Enter the Observation Room. Head forward and enter Thermic Control. Either directly hack the terminal with a high Intelligence check, or scan the terminal to track the cables to an electrical panel. Open the nearby shutters, then climb out and override the electrical panel disabling the subsystem. Climb back in and see another ""memory"" of Reed and Songbird.
Experimental Prototyping room: this area, near the neural network and observation rooms, Intelligence or by entering the code 714212. Inside, you can find blueprints for the Militech Canto cyberdeck.
Enter the Core
Evade Cerberus as you make your way back to Core Control. There is one more ""memory"" in the Observation Room. Upon reaching Core Control, interact with the terminal to trigger a scripted sequence and the conclusion. Retrieve the Behavioral system component from the fallen Cerberus. All that remains is to finish talking with Songbird and then decide her fate in Leave in Silence.","Investigate the area.

After breaching the party at Black Sapphire and stealing the identities of the two netrunners that will attend a meeting with Kurt Hansen and Songbird, Alex and Reed tell V to meet them at the basement of The Moth to discuss what comes next. The plan is to intercept the netrunners assume their identity and meet Hansen and snatch both the matrix and Songbird also killing Hansen for attempting an assassination on the president.
The plan is to hack into Charon Exotics and take control of the netrunners vehicle. To do that Alex instructs V to go to a tracking station of Charon Exotics and install the encryption key. But as V leaves The Moth Songbird reaches out to V and asks them to meet her to talk in private.
If V meets with Songbird:
Songbird asks V to come to a spot that she likes and reminisces about old times. Then after V confronts her, she confesses that she was the one who told Hansen about when and where Space Force One would be. She tells V that her real plan was for her and V to run away with the matrix and save the president, but that her getting captured changed everything. Her plan is to escape from Hansen and to give the matrix to a ripper who can help both her and V.
If V has sufficiently high Intelligence, V only needs to visit one Charon Exotics tracking station by choosing to remote access the second tracking station. If not, the second transceiver is broken and a kid named Luka can be paid 1000 Eurodollars to play a hot or cold game to restart the transceiver. After receiving the data, V needs to wait a couple hours for Reed to contact them. While waiting Alex reaches out and invites V to The Moth to kick back a little.
At The Moth V and Alex talk about who they would want to be if they weren't who they are now. They bond and V can choose to dance if they choose to.
A few hours later Reed calls and tells V to see a specific ripperdoc to get an implant that will allow V to use the biometrics of the netrunners. Reed also plans on taking Songbird with him but thinks he needs to ICE her first so implants a module to ICE Songbird into V as well.
as V gets the implants they talk to Johnny about the predicament that they are in. One side is a woman trying to survive as a living nuke, potentially dragging you with them to the explosion, while the other side is a man that runs on principles trying to do good by them potentially ready to mess up the entire situation. Leaving the ripperdoc finishes the mission.","Wait a day for a call from Reed.

Reported_Crime:_Comrade_Red,Phantom_Liberty,"On a hill top due north of the Trailer Park in Red Peaks, V will find an abandoned trailer and an underground bunker guarded by a lone turret.
After disabling the turret, climb on top of the trailer and you'll find the corpse of Valentin Krylov, along with a shard containing his conversation with Shelma. Reading the shard will automatically unlock the door to the underground bunker, where you'll find a hackable Access Point, a laptop, and Shelma's body on a netrunner's chair.
Reading the shard found on her body will reveal that Valentin and Shelma were Russians working directly under Mikhail Akulov. At the time of their deaths, they were tasked with tracking Chinese activities on the Net, spying on their dealings with Arasaka, as well as disguising Akulov's true intentions for visiting Night City. Unfortunately, the Chinese had anticipated this and managed to burn the duo before they could reach Akulov for help.","Open door to underground bunker.
Search the stash."
Epistrophy:_Wellsprings,Phantom_Liberty,"After agreeing to help Delamain track down his lost vehicles, V is able to encounter one in Wellsprings, Heywood. After getting close enough, the divergent Delamain will call V and utter ""Beep-beep, motherfucker!,"" identifying it is as the same divergent Delamain that V encountered earlier in Megabuilding H10's parking lot and wrecking their car. Not intent on getting taken back to Delamain Corp Headquarters, the Delamain turns hostile towards V.
After V manages to damage the car enough to have it surrender, they are able to allow Delamain to establish a connection with the vehicle and have it return home. Delamain will transfer V a modest sum of 1,640 eurodollars as part of the agreement.","Find the Delamain cab in Wellsprings.
Approach the Delamain cab.
Stay close to the Delamain cab.
Damage Delamain's car to deactivate it.

Gig:_Bloodsport,Phantom_Liberty,"This article requires cleanup.[Reason: Walkthrough must be written from a third-person perspective and not a gameplay walkthrough]
Roh is being held in the basement of a small building. The building is located inside a small walled courtyard, with one guard posted at the entrance and several Tyger Claws inside. The the courtyard is a public area, so the exterior guard doesn't react to V's presence in the courtyard. On the left side of the building is a side door that requires a Body check to open. On the roof above that door is a window that requires a Technical check to open. Elsewhere on the roof is a window that doesn't require any check to open.
If you enter from either of the attribute check entrances, you're positioned at the top of a stairwell that leads directly to the basement where Roh is being held. In the basement, there are two cameras and two guards. One guard is beating Roh, and the other is in a different room, watching TV. The guard that's watching TV will patrol, so it's a good idea to take him out first if you want to avoid triggering an alarm. Kill or incapacitate the guards and then lead Roh out of the building. If you entered through the door with the Body check, you have an easy exit out. The Tyger Claw at the entrance to the courtyard will be gone when you leave the area.
Roh moves quite slowly, so you will have to wait for him. When you reach the Fixer's transport, he stops to sit on a bench and asks V who paid to get him out. V can tell him it was Macidew or say that it's a secret. If V tells him it was Macidew, Roh seems surprised and expresses mixed feelings because Macidew is the reason he got picked up to begin with. V advises that it's a good idea if Roh and Macidew don't see each other again, and Roh agrees.
If V rescues Roh without tripping the alarms, Regina is impressed and includes a bonus payment for V to pick up at a drop point.","Go to the Tyger Claws' dojo.

The_Distance,Phantom_Liberty,"The gig can be unlocked by finishing The Beast In Me and waiting several days. V receives a message text from Jim Jarry, the organizer of the street races. After agreeing to his offer, there will be four new gigs on the map, marked with crossed flags. Going to one of the flags, V needs to sit on the marked bench and pay €$ 2,000 as entry fee to join the race.
Locations[]
There are 4 different races and tracks which represent the tracks from the Side Jobs:
The Beast in Me: City Center
The Beast in Me: Badlands
The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo
The Beast in Me: The Big Race",
The_Beast_In_Me,Phantom_Liberty,"Some time after V and Judy Álvarez save Evelyn Parker from the Scavengers, Claire Russell reaches out to V, offering them a job. She tells V that she needs help with some street races, and is looking for a driver, and since V is a reliable mercenary, she approached them. She asks that V meet with her in her garage on Valley street[B 1] in Arroyo, Santo Domingo during the day.[N 1]
As V enters the garage, they can hear Claire mumbling to herself about her car. She will slide out from under the vehicle, which she introduces to V as ""Beast."" As V asks about the race rules, Claire tells them that there aren't really any, other than that you race in pairs; a driver and a gunner. She tells V that she is more of a gearhead and a shooter than a driver, and that is why she needs one.
When V asks if she has raced before, Claire answers that she has, but that her previous driver passed away during a race a year ago.
If V agrees to become Claire's driver:
V accepts Claire's offer to be her driver during the street races. Claire says that there will be four races in total, and that the first one will start in the City Center district, followed by a race in the Badlands, then Santo Domingo, and a final round in Westbrook. When asked about a payout, Claire tells V that first place will receive some prize money, that they'll split equally. She will also tell V that the decision about which vehicle they will enter with is up to V.
As a final bit of information, she informs V that in order to qualify for the Watson final, they will have to qualify in the top three in at least two of the races. She asks V to wait for her call and meet her at the first race in City Center.
If V refuses to become Claire's driver:
V declines Claire's offer to be her driver during the street races–despite her efforts to convince them–and forfeits the job.[N 2]
City Center Race[]
Main article: The Beast in Me: City Center
In the morning of the following day, Claire will text V with the coordinates to the first race held in City Center. The race will start on Martin Luther King Boulevard and Skyline East in Vista del Rey, and go through Corpo Plaza to the finish on the Wellsprings Docks in Wellsprings.
Badlands Race[]
Main article: The Beast in Me: Badlands
Two days after participating in the City Center race, Claire will contact V again, this time to give them the the coordinates for the second race on Brooklands street in the Laguna Bend Reservoir, Badlands. For this race, Claire demands that they use her ""Beast"" instead of V's vehicle, as she wants to test it out in the field.
Santo Domingo Race[]
Main article: The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo
A day after competing in the Badlands race, V is contacted by Claire once again, this time for the final qualifying race in Santo Domingo. She tells V to go to Brandon and Wollesen Street in Arroyo. Unlike the previous race, Claire allows V to pick the vehicle they will be competing with in the race.
If Claire and V qualify for the final race:
Claire and V managed to qualify for the final race, taking place in Watson.
If V agreed to help Claire:
After accepting to help Claire kill Sampson, Claire will reach out to V later for the final race.
If V just wants to attend the final race:
V says they just want to compete in the final race, and will put the race over her dispute with Sampson. Claire understands V's decision, and will reach out to V later for the final race.
If V refused to help Claire kill Sampson:
After refusing to help Claire kill Sampson, V was sacked from the team.[N 3]
The Big Race[]
This section requires expanding. Click here to add more.📝
Main article: The Beast in Me: The Big Race
Two days after competing in the Santo Domingo race, Claire contacts V to flick them the details for the final race, instructing them to meet on Pardey street in Charter Hill, Westbrook.
During the final race, Peter Sampson will split off after his vehicle has mechanical issues. Claire wants V to follow him off the highway.
If V follows Sampson as he exits the highway:
After following Sampson off the highway, V and Claire witness Sampson collide with another car, and get out of their vehicle. Claire rushes over to Sampson, and starts to mock him for his current situation as he tries to crawl out from under his wrecked vehicle.
Sampson, begging for Claire to spare his life, claims that he didn't kill Dean, but that he got himself killed.
If V wants to hear what Sampson has to say:
V tells Claire that they want to hear what Sampson has to say. Sampson will tell them that Dean tried to pass him just before the finish line, but that he lost control of the car when Sampson rammed him, which is according to him not against the rules of the race. After hearing what Sampson has to say, V comes to the conclusion that it was an accident; an accepted risk of racing.
If Claire kills Sampson:
Claire shot Sampson despite V's attempts to spare his life. As a reward for V's help, she will gift V her ""Beast"", as she has no use for the car anymore.
If V prevents Claire from killing Sampson:[N 4]
V prevented Claire from killing Sampson. Despite Sampson living, she gifts V her ""Beast"" as a thank you, as she no longer has a use for the car.
After a few days, V receives a text message from Sampson, saying that he wants V to have his car.
If V agrees to go with Claire:
V agrees to go back to Claire's place. While driving back, she tells V more about Dean and that she has no desire to race in the future.
If V opted to finish the race instead of following Sampson:
Claire gets mad at V and refuses to service them at the Afterlife bar.[N 5]","Talk to Claire in her garage during the day.

Evelyn_Parker,Phantom_Liberty,,
Gig:_Heaviest_of_Hearts,Phantom_Liberty,"To be able to progress in this quest, you must first have completed Firestarter and, potentially, Run This Town.
V meets with Michael Maldonado underneath The Needle. He will explain that he was forced to testify against his son, Eric Maldonado, by D.A. Georgina Zembinsky and her partner, Hank Davis, after they tortured Michael for a false confession. He will tell V to go to the Heavy Hearts Club, where Georgina spends much of her time. On their way there, Mr. Hands will text V to not cause trouble within the Heavy Hearts Club, due to the fact that he operates out of there.
If V talks to the bartender, she will say that the D.A. is likely in the VIP booth, and to meet with a person named Jack in the bathroom for more information.
If V finds Jack:
V interrupts Jack while in the middle of some sort of deal in the toilets of Heavy Hearts.
If V pays 550 eurodollars to Jack or if V has the Streetkid Lifepath:
After paying Jack a sum of 550 eurodollars, or convincing him that V can get him better connections in Night City in exchange, he will tell V that Georgina may be in VIP room 04.
If V questions the waitress:
V questions one of the waitresses of the Heavy Hearts club, and learns that Georgina may be in VIP room 04.
If V breaks into the dressing room (requires high Technical Ability):
V breaks into the dressing room of the Heavy Hearts club, and can find a computer terminal there with a list of guests at the club. Through this, they learn that Georgina may be in VIP room 06.
If V enters VIP room 04:
V can interact with a man inside VIP room 04 telling them that Georgina is actually in VIP room 06.
Once inside VIP room 06, V will confront Georgina and Hank. They will explain that they need Eric in prison in order to help catch Hector Sacristán, a high-ranking Valentinos gang member accused of being a serial murderer she's been after for two years. They will also explain that Eric is a gang member himself, being accused of various crimes. Furthermore, they will deny that they tortured Michael, and that his testimony was not fabricated, despite what Michael claims, though he did receive payment for the testimony. They will then show a recording of his testimony, where Michael testifies that Eric told him over a holocall that Hector shot a man named Marcos Ferreria, and ordered his body to be dumped in the bay. They then offer to anonymize Michael's testimony, to ensure that Eric does not know that his father testified against him.
If V agrees to let Georgina anonymize the testimony:
Georgina will anonymize the testimony as she says she will, and V is free to leave the club and return to Michael.
Upon doing so, V will tell Michael that she removed his name and data from the testimony. Michael will be unhappy that Georgina did not delete the testimony, and refuse to pay V. No matter which dialogue option is chosen, V will demand that Michael pays up in return for V's silence. Michael does so, giving them €$2000 before dismissing them. Mr. Hands will appear unhappy that his client is unhappy, but will note it if V did not raise the alarm and pay them €$6000.
If V makes Georgina wipe the testimony:
V will not believe Georgina and Hank's claims and demand that they delete the testimony. Georgina will then tell Hank to threaten V but if they have a high enough Body attribute they can threaten Hank first, If V does so Hank will give in to V's demands and leave the room; Otherwise, Hank will attack V and they'll be forced to defeat him. Regardless of what happens, Georgina will delete the testimony, and V is free to leave the club and return to Michael. Upon doing so, V will tell Michael that Georgina has deleted Michael's testimony, and he responds happily to this. After V requests their payment, Michael will pay them €$2000, and V leaves. Mr. Hands will appear happy because his client is happy, and if V did not trigger the alarm, he will pay V €$6000; Otherwise, he will only pay them €$4000.","This section requires expanding.

Gig:_Breaking_News,Phantom_Liberty,"When you approach the area, Muamar Reyes will call you to start this job, directing you to meet with Ted Fox, a reporter for N54 news, who is waiting in a car outside the Kendachi factory. Ted explains that he wants to publish an expose about Kendachi cooperating with 6th Street to design its latest product line, but he needs V to help him acquire proof of this connection by covertly installing a tracker on a Kendachi transport. V must sneak into the factory, plant the tracker on the van, and get out without raising any alarms. Take the tracker from Ted to proceed.
The factory grounds are small, and there are only two cameras, both outside the main building, but several security guards patrol the parking lot. Two guards are also inside the building: one in the garage with the van and another in the adjacent office.
A fast stealth strategy is to equip Fortified Ankles or Reinforced Tendons and enter the factory from its roof by circling around behind it and climbing up using the dumpsters. Once on the roof, there is an unlocked hatch in the skylight that can be opened. Watch out for the guard near the van below, and jump down onto the van. Take down the guard and hide the body in the crate behind the van. Next, place the tracker by interacting with the van's driver-side panel door. To exit, simply go back the way you came by jumping up to the skylight from the van's roof (this is where the leg implants are most helpful) and leave by way of the dumpsters.
Once V is clear, Muamar will wire payment. If no one was alerted, he will be pleased and provide a bonus through a nearby dropbox. Otherwise, Teddy will still get the proof he needs, but Muamar gives V a ""C minus"" for their performance.","Meet with Ted Fox.

Gig:_Eye_for_an_Eye,Phantom_Liberty,"You can enter Tucker's building by one of the three routes: the front door where a guard is waiting; the back door (requires Technical Ability); or an upper window, accessible by augmented jumping (eg, Reinforced Tendons) to a fire escape. Inside, you will find eight guards scattered around the house. Avoid or neutralize them to reach Tucker's office on the top floor.
There, you can choose to hear her out. She will ask why you're there, expecting you to have been sent by one of her competitors, and becomes dismissive when she discovers that you were sent after her because of the girl she hit with her car, saying that the case is closed because she already paid compensation and was insured for such accidents. Relaxed, she offers you a deal: you get the money in her safe (which she declares must contain more than the payment you were offered to go after her) if you let her go. She says that nobody has to know. You can choose to take the deal and leave.
If you refused her deal or if you accepted the deal and then changed your mind, you neutralize Tucker - lethally or not. If you retrieve the administrator access token on her, you will have access to the money in her safe. Afterwards, you carry an unconscious Tucker's body to a car if she's still alive, or if she's dead you can simply leave.","Get inside Tucker's building.

Fool_on_the_Hill,Phantom_Liberty,"V must scan or interact with the 20 tarot cards in Night City. (Two of the Major Arcana, The Devil and Judgement, are only found in certain endings and are not required for this job. The four King cards of Phantom Liberty are also not required for this job.)
Misty mentions these missing cards and discusses The Fool's Journey in reaching The World. To reach it, there are four paths V can take to obtain them, foreshadowing the various endings, being The Sun, The Star, Temperance, and The Devil. V becomes bitter, saying they could die instead, also foreshadowing the suicide ending. After talking with her, Misty gifts V her dreamcatcher, which will appear in V's apartment above the bed.

V in cyberspace sees a red figure and follows it. V follows this flickering form a few times before they are eventually able to interact with him. They will wake up in a landfill and crawl out of it before Dexter DeShawn and Goro Takemura appear.
As V slips in and out of consciousness, Takemura ends up killing Dex and puts V in his vehicle to take them to Hanako Arasaka. However, when V comes back around, an injured Takemura needs their help and gives V an airhypo. V needs to take it and fight off Arasaka assassins who are attacking them.
If V fails to use the air hypo in time:
V failed to use the airhypo in time and succumbed to their injuries.
If V uses the air hypo in time:
Takemura will hand V a JKE-X2 Kenshin to dispatch the assassins, but then another with mantis blades will show up. After Takemura squashes the last assassin by crashing into a billboard, Takemura asks for a ripperdoc that V can trust so both of them can get the medical attention they require. After V names Viktor, they call Delamain, who picks the duo up. Takemura performs triage on V with Delamain's help, and narrowly manages to bring V to Viktor's Clinic in Little China, with Takemura almost succumbing to his own injuries upon arrival.
Several weeks pass with sporadic moments of consciousness—as Viktor tries to keep V alive—until one day V regains full consciousness, and is able to speak to Viktor.
Viktor explains that V's hallucinations are fragments of Johnny Silverhand's memories, triggered by Dex shooting them in the head. The Relic inside of their shard slot was consequently triggered, using nanites to revive their brain. However, these nanites also recognize V's mind as a foreign entity, which it is now destroying in an effort to clear the way for the Johnny's engram.
Misty enters the room and takes V back to their apartment and gives them medicine: Pseudoendotrizine that speeds up the process, and Omega blockers that slow the process down. V talks with her a bit before she leaves.
When V wakes up, Johnny will be rather hostile and when V tries to leave, he'll instead push them backwards. However, Johnny and V will realize that they are connected, with Johnny attempting to disconnect the Relic, nearly killing V. When V comes to and attempts to take the pills, Johnny slaps them out of their hand and instead demands that they ""stick an iron in your mouth and pull the trigger"", before leaving them to crawl to their pills. V swallows one and passes out.
V will wake up in the shower and then when leaving the apartment, Takemura will call asking to meet in Tom's Diner to talk. In the diner he talks about why he saved V and his future goals, including proving that Yorinobu killed his father using V as a witness. He also promises that Arasaka can help V with their biochip problem. V talks about alternative methods of possibly dealing with the biochip but Takemura disregards them and leaves the diner.
When Takemura leaves, Johnny Silverhand projects himself in front of V. He says he has changed his mind and doesn't want V dead anymore and that he and Rogue knew each other a long time ago and that she can help.","Approach the stranger.

Once V joins them at the Megabuilding, the group reiterates the plan before taking the elevator to the maintenance level, where Judy and V disembark to take control over the level, while Tom and Roxanne continue on to level 8 where Clouds is located.
To gain control over the level, Judy tells V that she needs to gain access to the control panel located on this floor, but that the Tyger Claws resistance in the area may make it difficult for them, and tasks them with taking out the Tyger Claws. After V has dispatched of the enemies, they regroup with Judy at the control panel. Judy informs V that she will not be coming with them to the penthouse, and that from here on out they are on their own until they meet with Maiko. Judy stays behind on the maintenance level to observe both V's situation as well as the situation in Clouds, and V takes the freight elevator to go to the roof of the Megabuilding.
Once on the rooftop, Judy instructs V to jump down onto the balcony of Hiromi's penthouse. Inside the penthouse, there are four more Tyger Claws that make it more difficult for V to gain access to Hiromi's office. After V dispatches them and opens the door to the office, V is greeted by Maiko, who was waiting for their arrival. Inside the room, Hiromi Sato is accompanied by Jun Azegami and Marcus Ichida, two other high-ranking Tyger Claws bosses, and three dolls for pleasure. The three of them are engaged in a braindance, while V and Maiko talk.
When V questions Maiko about the unexpected presence of the two Tyger Claws, she reveals that she only went along with Judy's plan to arrange her own rise to power as Hiromi's replacement. The Tyger Claw bosses are there so Maiko can expose Hiromi's incompetence, gain their trust, and join the Tyger Claws herself. She is certain that without the protection of a gang, the dolls will be unable to hold onto Clouds by themselves and will be crushed. As Maiko prepares to jack the men out, V must decide what to do next: either side with Maiko in her negotiation with the bosses, or side with Judy and stick to the original plan to liberate the dolls.[N 1]
If V sides with Maiko and accepts her money:
V decides to side with Maiko and accept her bribe. Angered by their decision, Judy severs ties with V over the betrayal and leaves the city. It is later revealed that although Clouds no longer has a constant Tyger Claw presence with Maiko in charge, working conditions are just as bad under Maiko as they were under Woodman. Tom and Roxanne are unhappy with the situation, but continue working at Clouds.[N 2][N 3]
If V sides with Maiko and declines her money:
Judy is disappointed with being played but comes to terms with it, admitting that Maiko knows more about how to protect Clouds than she does. It is later revealed that although Clouds no longer has a constant Tyger Claw presence with Maiko in charge, working conditions are just as bad under Maiko as they were under Woodman. Tom and Roxanne are unhappy with the situation but continue working at Clouds.[N 4]
If V sides with Judy and kills Maiko:
Judy is shocked that Maiko is dead. V can argue that it was self-defense, and Maiko should have known better, but Judy insists that Maiko's death was unnecessary. Judy leaves, saying she needs time to process events. It is later revealed that the Tyger Claws retaliated against the dolls harshly and reclaimed Clouds. Tom is killed, Roxanne is forced into hiding, and Clouds is closed indefinitely.[N 5]
If V sides with Judy and Maiko is left alive:
Judy is pleased that V stopped Maiko's power grab and Clouds is now managed by the dolls.[N 5][N 6] Judy will mention that the Tyger Claws retaliated, resulting in Tom's death and Roxanne fleeing.
After the confrontation in Hiromi's office is settled, V must leave the apartment and take the elevator to the ground level to meet with Judy to discuss what happened.","Wait for Judy's call.

The_Streetkid,Phantom_Liberty,"V starts out by fixing their broken nose at the El Coyote Cojo bar located in The Glen. Pepe, the bartender, tells V that he took out a loan from Kirk Sawyer, a new small-time Fixer in town, and Kirk is threatening to break his legs if he doesn't pay soon. Pepe requests that V either talks to Kirk into either forgetting about the debt or finding another way to settle it.
V approaches Kirk and, while he refuses to forgive Pepe's debt, a deal is settled. Kirk tasks V with stealing a Rayfield Aerondight owned by a corporate from Arasaka; If V is able to steal the car, then Kirk will forget about the debt Pepe owes him, and Kirk will even pay V some extra eddies for the job. After agreeing to the deal, V drives to Westbrook where the car is located, hitching a ride with Padre, a friend and local Fixer. Despite a brief confrontation with 6th Street gangoon Sam Carter, Padre delivers V to their destination and hands V his card.
Using the service key given to V by Kirk, V unlocks the car and turns it on, bypassing the alarm systems on the car that prevents the Night City Police Department from being alerted. Things seem to be going smoothly until someone suddenly opens the door from the outside, and V finds themselves staring down the barrel of a gun wielded by Jackie Welles, who intends to take the car for himself. V is then interrupted by the sudden arrival of the NCPD and Inspector Stints, who capture both of V and Jackie and has his officers pin them to the ground. Stints criticizes the two of them on their life choices and how little has changed, but before he can take them into custody, an Arasaka corporate, Kaoru Fujioka, who owns the car, comes to see the commotion. He uses his corporate reputation to order Stints to break V's legs and dump both V and Jackie in the river to drown. The officers knocks them unconscious, but instead of following what the Araskaka corporate said, Stints instead decides to just leave both V and Jackie in a alley since he dislikes corpos as much as everyone else.
V wakes up in the alley. V and Jackie talk as V takes a moment to recover. After getting to know V and the reason why they were stealing the Aerondight he had his eyes on, Jackie says that Kirk isn't as powerful as he seems to be, and his threats against Pepe are hollow at best. Jackie then invites V to breakfast, ending the questline leading into an introduction montage of Night City.","Find Kirk on the second floor.

No_Easy_Way_Out,Phantom_Liberty,"This job can be started after completing Spider and the Fly.
Coach Fred messages V with a request to help a fellow boxer named Aaron. V meets with Aaron at the boxing ring near Montezuma's Throne, who explains he needs their help to reach a particular ripperdoc, Damir Kovac.
Aaron and V decide to meet at 9PM at the Digimmortal exposition in Terra Cognita. Here, Aaron confesses that he is in hot water with the Animals. The gang supported his fighting career but, along with his implants, saddled him with a chip that could be remotely triggered to render him unconscious, thus throwing his matches. Aaron suspects that Angie, a pack-leader of the Animals, is out to get him, which is why he needs Damir to remove the implant.
The duo makes their way inside Digimmortal. When they reach Damir, Aaron undergoes a procedure to have the chip implant blocked, while V passes time in a nearby chair until the procedure is finished.
After some time passes, the procedure completes, but Angie arrives at the clinic while Aaron is still under sedation. She offers V a cut of the winnings if they agree to leave and let Aaron take the fall.
Agree to Angie's deal:
A few days later, Angie will ask to meet V at the boxing ring in Dogtown, where she will reward them ﻿22,000 Eurodollars. Coach Fred will message them, lamenting they couldn't help Aaron.
If V has the Corpo lifepath:
V can extort Angie for an additional 20% eurodollars.
Refuse Angie's deal:
If V refused to cooperate with Angie, they'll have to fight her and the two Animals accompanying her. If they manage to do so, Aaron and V will be able to leave freely. However, a few days later, Aaron will request that V meets with him at the Dream Gig bar in Dogtown. When V arrives, a server will mention that they spotted Aaron with some Animals in the alley out back. There, V will find Aaron's dead body near the dumpster. Johnny will appear and speak his mind, and Coach Fred will send a final message to V, concluding the job.
Threaten Angie:
This option is only available if V defeated Sasquatch during I Walk the Line
Angie will be intimidated and back off, and Aaron will awake unharmed. If V tells Aaron to throw the fight or talks about his past, he will throw the fight but later find satisfaction as a coach for kids in Dogtown. If V convinces Aaron to fight, he will lose and travel to Costa Rica where he will attempt a professional fighting career again.
Regardless of choice, V is able to leave Digimmortal safely and will receive 5,000 Eurodollars. However, the Scavs are not marked as friendly and they can turn hostile if V strays too far from the path to the exit.","Read the message from Coach Fred.

After waking up, a WNS report on the television reveals that Saburo Arasaka has taken over the body of his son, Yorinobu Arasaka, while they hold a speech on television ensuring that the Arasaka Corporation will go back to its roots and be stronger than ever. As the news broadcast ends, Professor Kusama enters the room to see how V's recovery is going with various tests, such as reading text from a monitor, solving a Rubik's cube, responding, responding to keywords, and motor functions test using treadmill. After the tests, V goes back to sleep, and has another nightmare.
V hears Johnny once more while sleeping, and again drawing them to the door. This time the door opens to the hallway of the station. Upon exploring the hallway, V relives the memory of Jackie's death, with the Relic being inserted again into their neuroport.

After having exhausted all other options, V has no choice but to meet with Hanako Arasaka at Embers.[N 1] After having been cleared by security and taking the elevator to the 13th floor, V meets with Hanako in person.
As V approaches Hanako, she stands up from behind the piano and tells V that she knows the location of Mikoshi, beneath Arasaka Tower. Johnny will interrupt V as they sit down at the bar, after which Hanako will state that her brother should be held accountable for the murder of their father, and the Arasaka Corporation should learn the truth of the situation.[N 2] She suggests a trade in which V confronts Yorinobu at a meeting and testifies to the actual events, and in exchange she will help to rid them of the construct.
After heading back to the elevator and pressing the button to return to street level, Johnny will stop the elevator and suggest that if V gives him control of the body, he can find Mikoshi without Hanako's assistance, by teaming up with Rogue and blasting into Arasaka Tower, like they did in 2023.[N 3] After talking with Johnny the Relic malfunctions and V blacks out.
V awakes to find themself in Viktor's clinic once again. Viktor explains that Johnny had to drag V back from Embers, and once V is able to sit, he'll give his prognosis: that one more Relic malfunction will likely kill you. After standing up, V will take the last of the pills and a Unity Handgun from the nearby table and, as V goes to leave the clinic, Misty will suggest a better place to decide what you should do next - a place which Jackie once visited when he had an important decision to make.
She leads V to the elevator behind her shop, which they take up to the 9th floor, then up a few more stairs onto the roof of the building. V sits next to Misty as she briefly reminisces about Jackie, then leaves V alone to talk with Johnny to decide on what comes next.[N 4][N 5]
If V chooses the Path of Least Resistance:
Instead of getting help from any of their allies, V opts to put things to rest, and throws away the pills. V and Johnny have one final conversation before V grabs their pistol and commits suicide.
If V chooses Hanako Arasaka's help:[N 6]
Johnny will be upset with V's decision but ultimately says he doesn't care and that V'll regret this decision. V calls Hanako but she says Yorinobu already invited her to his estate and his people are watching her; and that she'll send someone to pick up V and bring them to the estate so so they can rescue her. Upon going downstairs Misty talks to V and offers to do a reading, when she finds out you're working with Arasaka she's upset because they caused Jackie's death and she leaves. When the driver enters the shop it turns out to be Anders Hellman and he talks with V about an prior conversation.
If V chooses Panam Palmer's help:[N 7]
Johnny asks if V is sure about this decision and says he thinks they'll regret it. V calls Panam and tells her that they need into Arasaka tower and tells her about Mikoshi. V says if they don't get access to Mikoshi that they are going to die. so Panam agrees to help V and tells them to wait for her to pick them up.

To receive this job, V must have resolved amicably the dispute between Kerry Eurodyne and Us Cracks during I Don't Wanna Hear It and completed Off the Leash.
Some time after completing the prerequisite jobs, V will receive a call from Blue Moon, who asks them to help her dealing with a stalker that has sent death threats. If asked, the only clue she can provide is that he signs his letters ""GC"". Her plan is to go for a stroll around Kabuki Roundabout to lure the stalker out so V can catch him in the act. Then she wants V to teach him a lesson without killing him, because that would be bad for Us Cracks' image. V agrees to the plan and meets Blue Moon at Kabuki Roundabout. She will walk through part of the lower level of the roundabout, turn into an alley to the market and then go up to the footbridge.
Right after starting the operation, V notices a suspicious person on the upper level who starts taking photos of Blue Moon. Confronting him will complete the optional objective ""Make sure the stalker isn't lurking on any level of Kabuki Roundabout."". When questioned, he will say he is taking pictures of Blue Moon to sell them. If asked whether he has noticed anything out of the ordinary, he will point out a girl in green who is in every single photo he has taken.
Scanning her reveals that her name is Griselda Martinez. She has a brown ponytail, a green tank top and a pink rabbit backpack. She can be first seen leaning against a wall while Blue Moon is talking to V, then starts following at street level with her head turned towards Blue Moon, who is on the lower level. She will lean against the railing while Blue Moon is confronted by a group of 5 Animals who think they recognize her. After passing them, Blue Moon will stop to browse a magazine display. At this point Griselda will approach her, asking to take a picture together and saying her name is Green Cloud.
If V has been told the stalker's letters were signed GC, they can confront Griselda about her nickname and how she signs her letters, making her hostile. Otherwise, she can still be questioned, but, without any proof, she will just walk away. If followed, she will go to the nearby Weapon Vendor and, if asked what is she doing in a gun shop, she becomes nervous and attacks V.
Alternatively, V can keep following Blue Moon until she reaches the middle of the footbridge, where Green Cloud reappears in front of her, pulling a gun and starting to rant. V should quickly incapacitate Green Cloud before she shoots and kills Blue Moon, failing the job.
In any case, after neutralizing Green Cloud, V can search her body to find a Disturbing Diary and a Marred Still of Blue Moon, a picture with the eyes cut out.
With the stalker revealed and unconscious, Blue Moon asks V what to do. They can either tell her to let the NCPD handle things, or simply kill the stalker. If Green Cloud is killed, Blue Moon will be briefly dismayed. V will justify themselves by saying that stalking is not punished with lifetime imprisonment, and they would have eventually attacked Blue Moon again. If V tells Blue Moon to let the police handle it, she will be worried about the stalker attacking again, with V telling her to simply give them another call in such an event. There are no consequences for either option. Blue Moon leaves and will send V payment soon after.","Go to the meeting spot and wait for Blue Moon.
Make sure the stalker isn't lurking on any level of Kabuki Roundabout. [Optional]
Find the stalker and don't let Blue Moon get hurt.
Defeat the stalker.
Find evidence you got the right person.
Wait for Blue Moon next to the stalker.

Beat_on_the_Brat:_Pacifica,Phantom_Liberty,"This one requires you to complete the main job Transmission first to then open up the side job Send in the Clowns which needs to be completed for this. As such, you can actually end up doing the championship fight in Beat on the Brat with Razor Hugh before you get this one based on how you completed other quests.
You'll be fighting in the large, dry pool area, so you'll have plenty of room to evade. That said, your major concern is Ozob's nose: it is a live grenade so if you hit it wrong too many times, you could set it off.
Ozob's grenade nose will detonate after accumulating about 75% of his health in damage to his head. This instantly kills Ozob and V wins by ""technical knockout"" and must talk to the referee standing on the side of the pool to get the reward money and complete the quest.","Go to the fight in Pacifica.

Upon arrival, an Trauma Team Atlus can be seen flying away, leaving behind a scene of carnage: Multiple dead bodies, some wearing the uniforms of the Wraiths, and others, oddly enough, sporting very out-of-place high end clothing, something more likely to be seen on a Media; also present is an admittedly nice-looking Thorton Colby CX410 ""Gran Butte"".
After a little searching, V finds a shard on one of the apparent victims which tells the story: Evidently, the executive of some high-end clothing business got it in his head to do a photoshoot out here, as a way of demonstrating the versatility and comfort of their clothing line and appealing to a more ""rustic"" sense of fashion, with the Butte being the centerpiece as a stand-in for an executive limo or sports car. Such activity attracted the Wraiths, who decided that they'd rather shoot bullets than pictures at the unfortunate models. Said models, however, were savvy enough to bring their own iron for just such an occasion, and a firefight ensued between the two sides. What was left of the photoshoot team fled in the AV, leaving their set, and their prized Thorton Colby, behind for the taking-and better for it to be in V's capable hands than the Raffen Shiv.","Search the area.

Gig:_The_Man_Who_Killed_Jason_Foreman,Phantom_Liberty,"V witnesses local residents mourning of Jason Foreman in a dirty courtyard in Longshore Stacks. Mr. Hands instructed them to speak to Briana, the client. Briana explains that one the Stacks' younger residents, Jason Foreman, has recently been killed by a BARGHEST super killer, Leon Rinder.
V has to use their scanner to investigate the clues around the courtyard, mostly holes in the wall splashed with blood, massive footprints in the mud, a box of fired bullets and a fallen failsafe on the roof of a nearby container.
Then Briana gives V a encrypted shard to read. A hacking puzzle unlocks it. A conversation between Jason and Slava Makarov, a scavenger, leads V to a former motel in Pacifica, Los Osos. Jason was indeed an intermediary between a man supplying top-tier Militech chrome and the scavengers.
V can investigate new clues in the former motel - now a scavengers' hideout - to learn more about Rinder's actions. Rinder himself is locked in a room on third floor and is guarded by a heavily chromed scavenger. V finds out that most of Rinder's chrome has been sold to scavengers by Rinder himself. He reaches for a pistol when V enters, but in his convalescent state, he only manages to knock it out of his own reach.
If V has investigated the area:
Completing the Investigate the area. [Optional] objective unlocks the dialog option ""Whatever I did""? Let me enlighten you. when V confronts Rinder.
It appears that one of Slava Makarov's suggestions pushed Jason into agressively demanding a bigger share to the supplier, Leon Rinder, which may have contributed to his death by leading the latter into cyberpsychosis.
If V decides to kill Rinder:
Take Rinder's dog tags from his body and bring them to Briana Dolson to complete the gig.
If V decides it is not worth killing Rinder:
Take Rinder's dog tags and bring them to Briana Dolson to complete the gig.
If V decides to spare Rinder and accept his deal:
Leon gives V the coordinates of his personal stash, a garage in Terra Cognita, starting the quest Addicted To Chaos. Take Rinder's dog tags and bring them to Briana Dolson to complete the gig.
If V makes Rinder call Regina:

When questioning Rinder after completing the Investigate the area. [Optional] objective, choosing the dialogue option ""Whatever I did""? Let me enlighten you. will make V realize that Rinder suffers from cyberpsychosis.
You must also choose Put gun to Rinder's head | Choose your next words carefully dialog option, which will give you an option to force Rinder to contact Regina Jones for help.
If you choose to send Rinder to Regina, you will still get his dog tags to finish the gig. He will also send you the coordinates to his stash, starting the mission Addicted To Chaos. After a few days Rinder will contact you via text message and will thank you for making him contact Regina. Some time after that, Rinder will text V again, this time saying he wants to take responsibility and compensate the community for his bad deeds. He intends to offer Briana some eddies, conceding that it ""won't change much"" and is ""prolly[sic] gonk anyway."" V can either encourage or discourage this idea. Allowing Rinder to contact Briana proves his intuition correct. Briana will pull V aside the next time V visits that area of the Longshore Stacks to berate V for not honoring the intent of the gig's contract. She says that she doesn't believe she will ever forgive Rinder, and revealing his true fate to the others would 'break' them due to lack of closure. At the end of her tirade, she declares that V is no longer welcome in her area of the Stacks.","Meet with Briana during the evening vigil (10pm-6am)

Meetings_Along_The_Edge,Phantom_Liberty,"The Zen master can be found just south of Muamar Reyes's usual location, overlooking a westward facing cliff just off the paved road in Jackson Plains. V can open conversation with different questions, though the Zen Master will only answer one, and may indicate he is aware of V's predicament with Johnny. He will then offer a meditation BD, with his usual payment condition. V can pay either nothing, or around 600 eddies for the practice. The final meditation is on the element of air, and like the previous sessions, the Zen Master will disappear after it ends. A shard, his robes, and his altar-necklace are left behind, and V can take his altar as an apartment decoration. Johnny will be seated next to the Zen Master's robes and through conversation, implies he did not see the Zen Master at all, and suggests V speak with Misty about the experience.","Approach the Zen master.

Space_Oddity,Phantom_Liberty,"In the south side of Santo Domingo, you will come across a group of homeless men crowded around a corpo briefcase, unable to open it. You can convince them to hand it over before they get hurt, either by threatening them (requires Body) or paying them off.
Once the briefcase is V's, you will be tasked to find the body of its former owner, who can be found by following a scannable blood trail to the nearby dumpsters. From the corpse of the hapless corpo, you will retrieve an access card that can be used to open the locked briefcase. Alternatively, you can hack it open (requires Intelligence). Either way, open the file launch.exe on the computer; this will send a signal triggering something to drop from orbit. You will be directed to a new objective about two kilometers to the south, in the Badlands.
Go to the new marker, but be wary of a Militech response team that was also dispatched to the area. All seven soldiers will need to be taken out before the pod can be accessed. Once done, open the pod, and Johnny will comment it is a valuable painting, likely from a wealthy highrider on the moon.
Once looted, the Untitled 18 – Brancesi, 2021 will be on display in V's Apartment.","Talk to the bums.

Once the guards are neutralized, a backpack container in a well-lit area somewhat near the gate will have a conversation datashard and assorted items, and the looting of which will end the first part of the quest.
Once the unnamed scanner hustle is complete, a second quest will be triggered. It will lead to a body on the roof of a nearby building which previously held 3 of the guards.

Upon reaching the room at the hotel, V'll be greeted by a provocatively dressed Meredith, who comments that they probably didn't expect to see her there. V will ask what happens next, and a cutscene of the two having a romantic scene will play out.

Gig:_Many_Ways_to_Skin_a_Cat,Phantom_Liberty,"This facility has a number of ways to enter it and 8 active cameras, so you'll need to tread carefully if you want to do stealth. Note also that you have to drive the van away, so if you don't want to deal with a firefight later on, make sure to take out the guards at the front entrance where the closed bay doors are.
You can enter the facility through one of the two gates or, for a discreet entry, through one of the openings in the fence (there's an opening near each gate). Once inside the fencing, you can enter the main building itself either through the doors on the first floor or climb up to the roof where there's a door into the stairwell or an open window to a small hallway. Note if you use the window, one of the cameras is here so make sure to take care of it before entering if doing stealth.
To get access to the van, you'll need to enter the room that the above camera was right above with a lone guard. Take them out, then access the computer to authorize you as a driver. Now you just need to get to the van downstairs and drive it to the destination.","Go to the Revere Courier Services facility.

The_Corpo-Rat,Phantom_Liberty,"V starts out looking into the mirror while stress-vomiting in the sink of a bathroom located in the Arasaka Tower. After briefly speaking with their longtime friend Jackie Welles over the holo, V is called by their superior, Arthur Jenkins, who is upset because of a major data leak in Frankfurt that has put the corporation's operations at risk, and he orders them to his office, though V is able to freely walk into their own office and read emails located on the desk before reporting to Jenkins.
V finds Jenkins ordering a cyberattack against the European Space Agency council to delay their vote on revoking Arasaka's lunar base licenses. Jenkins is called by an angered Susan Abernathy—his superior and rival in the Arasaka Special Operations branch—who berates him for the attack and threatens to discipline him later. Already chafing under Abernathy due to her having smeared his name in Osaka to steal a promotion from him, Jenkins orders V to take her out, giving them a datashard containing all of Abernathy's personal information and a large sum of eurodollars.
Arthur tells V to use their underworld contacts to off her once and for all and provides them with paper eddies to pay for the work. Afterwards, V gets into an Arasaka AV that takes them to Lizzie's Bar in Watson. Landing on the roof, V is confronted by basketball players upset about the court being a landing pad for a corporate AV; V may either subdue them with a lightning attack, or simply threaten them into submission, before approaching the Mox door guard, who lets V in.
Inside the bar V meets up with Jackie, explaining the situation to him and requesting his help, but Jackie, seeing the extreme risk involved in working for Arasaka, refuses. However, before V can convince him otherwise or get an alternate plan started, the pair is interrupted by Arasaka agents. They reveal that Abernathy is already aware of the hit ordered against her and demands them to hand over the datashard given to V by Jenkins. V initially refuses, so they strip V of their corporate privileges and disables their cyberware, forcing them to hand over the shard and finalizing V's termination from the corporation. The Arasaka agents then attempt to take V into custody as well, as a ""favor"" to Abernathy, but Jackie intercepts them, pointing out that they are isolated from the rest of their compatriots and that a firefight in unfamiliar territory could end badly for them, which convinces the agents to leave V alone. The mission ends with V, still woozy from their disabled cybernetics, losing their balance and falling to the floor, to which Jackie helps them back on their feet, setting off to start their journey together.","Leave the bathroom.

After a brief conversation with Jackie Welles at Misty's Esoterica, he tells V that he's arranged a meeting for them with a local fixer, Dexter DeShawn, about a job. V heads to Dex's limo, which is a short walk from Misty's. During the meeting, which takes place in the limo, V is told about a job to steal an experimental biochip from Arasaka.
Dex mentions that the Maelstrom gang ambushed a Militech convoy and stole the experimental Flathead drone, which will be needed for the job, and that Meredith Stout, a Militech corporate agent, could help V obtain it from the gang. He also suggests paying a visit to the client for the job, Evelyn Parker.
After Dex drops V off at Kabuki Roundabout, V calls Jackie to bring him up to speed about what went down during the meeting, and asks if V plans to visit Maelstrom or Evelyn first.","Talk to Jackie.

Johnny will ask V to call Rogue and ask her out on his behalf, to try and make up for never taking her out properly in the past. As V calls Rogue, V asks her where she would want to go if the two went on a date, which she answers with the old drive-in movie theater named Silver Pixel Cloud in North Oak. V says they'll swing by the Afterlife to pick her up.
If the current time is not in the evening:
Rogue sends V a text message informing them that she is currently engaged with other things and asks that they come in evening.
V meets Rogue at the Afterlife during the evening, where she can be seen talking with Emmerick Bronson—who appears to be disappointed Rogue is going out on a date with V.
If V obtained the Porsche 911 Turbo (930):
Rogue asks V how they obtained the car and will remark on having a lot of memories in the car.[Notes 2]
Rogue and V get in the car and drive to the theater. During the ride, Rogue tells V that it was originally her idea to take Johnny to the movie theater, and that Johnny's idea of a romantic night out was raiding Arasaka Towers. After a while she will ask what Johnny's motive is, to which V will reply that Johnny has changed and is a more selfless person, and wants to make up for his past.
Arriving at the Silver Pixel Cloud, they discover that the place has been shut down and locked up. V searches around and finds a usable access code on the nearby terminal and is able to open the door.[Notes 3]
Inside the cinema premises, Rogue will walk over to a nearby car wreck, while V goes up a staircase to reach the projector room. When V starts up the projector, which will play Bushidō X: Fade to Black, they subsequently surrender control to Johnny by taking the Pseudoendotrizine.
Johnny heads down the stairs and sits next to Rogue on the car and reminisces about the past while they watch the movie. After a while, Johnny asks Rogue if this is how she'd imagine a date between them going, to which she replies that she'd always expected that some change was needed, just not to the current degree. She asks Johnny to pretend it is 2015, and asks if there is anything he would change since then.[Notes 4] Johnny answers her question, which causes her to become emotional and think about what ifs and all that.
If Johnny kisses Rogue:
A short romantic scene will play out between Rogue and Johnny, but Rogue interrupts it as it doesn't feel right. She confesses to Johnny that she is no longer the same person as she was before and that is just isn't going to work anymore. Rogue will promptly leave the drive-in theater, as Johnny gives back control to V by taking an Omega blocker.
If Johnny tells Rogue he doesn't have much to offer:
Johnny tells Rogue that he doesn't have much to offer right now, to which she replies that he has more to offer now than he did back then. Johnny admits that he messed up, and that he could have just been himself around her, without having to pretend or pose. Rogue responds to this by telling Johnny that it is too late now and that she's no longer the Rogue he knew back in 2015. She suggests that they just continue watching the movie, after which Rogue will leave, and Johnny will give back control to V by taking an Omega blocker.
After Rogue's departure, Johnny asks that V meet with Kerry Eurodyne.","Call Rogue and ask her out.
Talk to Rogue.
If it is not evening:
Go pick up Rogue at the Afterlife in the evening.
Wait until evening.

Notes[]


↑ The title of this job comes from the in-universe Samurai song ""Blistering Love.

↑ The vehicle is automatically called if it has been obtained during Chippin' In.

↑ The door authorization code is 0000.

↑ Rogue asking Johnny to pretend it is 2015 is likely an error or a test from Rogue, as Rogue and Johnny already had met at that time.

After the disastrous date with Rogue Amendiares at the Silver Pixel Cloud, Johnny Silverhand asks that V goes to the North Oak Sign in North Oak.
If V did not give Johnny a second chance during Chippin' In:
After talking with Johnny at the Northern Oilfields, he asks that V goes to the North Oak Sign in North Oak.
Johnny says that he wants V to go to Kerry Eurodyne's villa so that he can talk to his old friend, since he heard news that he is depressed and attempted suicide.
When V enters the villa, Kerry is taking a shower and V can give control to Johnny near the guitar displays.[Notes 1]
After giving control to Johnny by taking the Pseudoendotrizine, Johnny picks up a guitar and plays some of his old tunes. Alerted by the music, Kerry hastily jumps out of the shower with his revolver in hand, but almost immediately recognizes Johnny from the way that he plays the guitar. The two catch up and talk about their past lives.
Johnny asks Kerry if he'd be interested in getting the old Samurai back together to do a gig, which Kerry agrees to. Johnny is asked to get Nancy Hartley on board while Kerry arranges everyone else.
When V calls Nancy, her assistant, Steven, picks up instead and tells V that she has been missing for two days after having gone to the Totentanz to investigate a story.","Meet Johnny by the North Oak sign.

After escaping from Arasaka's clutches at the Redwood Market in Japantown, you are contacted by Goro Takemura. He has brought Hanako Arasaka to his safe house inside an Abandoned Apartment Building on Vine Street in Vista del Rey, Heywood, and tells you to knock four times on the door to safely get inside.
Once you arrive at the safe house, head to apartment 303 on the third floor and knock on the door four times, Takemura will open the and tell you to hurry up inside. Once inside, you talk with Takemura and sit down with Hanako, to whom you will explain the situation around her father's death.
Hanako will not answer to any word you say, and weird sounds are coming from the hallway. Takemura instructs you to check out what is happening. Shortly afterwards, Arasaka forces breach the safe house, leaving you to fight your way outside to safety once more.
Note:
After Arasaka forces breach the apartment building, it is possible to save Takemura from Arasaka's forces. You can fight your way back up to the third floor, or use the Fortified Ankles/Reinforced Tendons if you have them installed. You and Goro Takemura will then both fight your way outside. If he is not saved, he will not appear during The Devil ending if it is chosen during Nocturne Op55N1, and you won't be able to get The Devil achievement (even if you choose to side with Arasaka at the end).

The_Beast_in_Me:_The_Big_Race,Phantom_Liberty,"Approximately two days after the race in Santo Domingo, V is contacted by Claire Russell with the details for the final race starting on Pardey street in Charter Hill, Westbrook.
When V arrives at the starting location of the race, they contact Claire to inform them that they are there. On the phone, Claire asks V which vehicle they'll want to use for the race, and recommends that V picks a car that is fast, as the race will be a highway race. After hanging up, V leans against the wall and waits for everyone to arrive.
As V approaches Claire, they hear heated arguing going on, as Claire and Peter Sampson are butting heads. As soon as Peter spots V, he starts to antagonize Claire even more, and suggests that V should get out while they can, since Claire gets her drivers killed. Sampson continues to verbally attack Claire, claiming that her late husband got himself killed as he took on more than he bargained for and that his ego got the better of him. V, unable to calm the situation down, can do nothing but watch. Sampson gets in his vehicle and gets one more jeer from Claire before she storms off to the vehicle she and V will be competing in.
After starting the race, Claire wants V to stick close to Sampson so they can follow him. Two thirds into the race, Peter Sampson's car will get in trouble and has to veer off from the highway. Claire urges V to follow him.

They drive off the highway only to watch Sampson collide with another car soon after. Claire and V exit their vehicle and sees Sampson crawling out.[N 1]
If V decides they want to finish the race:

This quest becomes available after completing Just Another Story at least 7 times:
Muamar will contact V about a gig, telling them to drop all other deliveries for now (despite this, players can still continue to do courier missions as normal if so desired), and will ask to meet at his hangout by the dam. Upon arrival Muamar will be seen arguing with Ayden Daniels, before the latter leaves. Muamar will tell V about a gig to steal an Arasaka truck from the docks, with Daniels providing support, before walking off sullen. Johnny Silverhand will appear telling V to follow Muamar to ask what's wrong. Speak to Muamar about what's troubling him, then after the conversation finishes go to the Arasaka Port by the City Center in Corpo Plaza.
At the docks, find and speak to Daniels first, who will tell V what to look for: a Behemoth truck aboard the ship docked there, with several guards within the compound on watch. Regardless of whether the player gets to the truck stealthily or not, once V boards the truck an alarm will be rung with several Arasaka squads hitting the docks soon afterwards, with a firefight breaking out between Arasaka and Daniels. Players have the option of getting out of the truck to save Daniels at this point, or leaving him to his fate by driving off with the truck.
If V gets out to save Daniels, Arasaka will have more time to set up roadblocks along the escape route and some of the medical equipment in the truck will get damaged along the way. Muamar will comment on this later, Daniels will message V angrily about this.
If V leaves Daniels behind he will die, but none of the equipment will get damaged.

Gig:_Guinea_Pigs,Phantom_Liberty,"V must navigate the Biotechnica Hotel, which is divided into three accessible floors (lobby, floor 19, and the roof) that are swarming with Biotechnica security guards and robots, to eliminate Joanne Koch. She is wanted by the Red Ocher, a nomad clan that lost 70 members to the effects of a virus test run for Koch's pet project, codenamed Nightingale. Koch can be killed on the spot, or incapacitated and airlifted out of the building for Red Ochre to deal with personally.
First, V must reach Koch's apartment. The lobby of the hotel is patrolled by several guards and monitored by surveillance cameras and a turret. All of this can be bypassed by entering through an unlocked side door around the side the building with the police cordon, which leads into a small staff office with a single worker inside. A computer in the room can be used to view or disable the lobby cameras. Bypass or eliminate the worker, then head out the office door and turn right to find the elevator. Alternatively, the other side of the building has a door that can be opened with sufficient Technical Ability.
The 19th floor is covered by more guards, dormant robots, and cameras. One guard patrols the atrium outside the elevator, and others are inside a security office at the end of the corridor opposite the elevator. At the intersection, head left to a cluster of apartment entrances and an access door to the roof that is covered by a single camera. Sufficient Technical Ability can unlock the door to Koch's apartment, otherwise take the door to the roof to find an alternate way in.
The roof is monitored by two surveillance cameras and four guards. Two of the guards are constantly moving around a skylight with an open window that leads into the apartment. Bypass or deal with them, then jump down through the open window to find Joanne Koch absorbed in a braindance.
V can either kill Koch and leave the way they came, or knock her out for the Red Ochre survivors. Koch can also be woken up and spoken to, which causes her to plead for the chance to upload her Nightingale project data for her colleagues to use. She reasons that the deaths of the Red Ochre members would be in vain if the test data obtained from Nightingale never sees the light of day. If V allows her to upload the data, she will move to a computer, but proceed to call for security. If V refuses her, she will run away and also call for security.
If V intends to deliver Koch to Red Ochre alive and incapacitates her, Dino Dinovic will notify them that an AV, specifically a Zetatech Canopy, is on the way to the roof. If V has not already eliminated the four guards on the roof, they will be prompted to do so at this time to allow the AV to safely land. Take Koch to the roof by exiting her apartment and using the adjacent roof access staircase, wait for the AV, then deposit her body inside it. Lastly, return to the 19th floor, take the elevator back down, and leave the hotel to complete the gig.","Reach the 19th floor.

Gig:_Spy_in_the_Jungle,Phantom_Liberty,"After being given the gig, V will be directed to to meet the Brazilian Intelligence Agency agents Steven Santos and Ana Friedman at their room in the Paradise Hotel in the Longshore Stacks, where they provide further information on the gig. They reveal the biomonitor of their mentor and colleague Mark Bana has recently reactivated after he was presumed dead in Dogtown, and he is being hunted by Scavengers led by Boris Ribakov at Organitopia in Terra Cognita. The agents do not have official permission from the BIA to investigate and have hired V to find Bana under the radar.
Upon arriving at Organitopia, scavs will be found guarding the museum's locked-down entrance. After entering through a smashed gate, opening a shuttered window with a Body check of 3, and jacking into an access point to gain further entry, Bana will contact V and indicate that he is okay and hiding deeper inside the museum past a large indoor jungle exhibit. Scavs, including netrunning Spiders, will be found patrolling the area on the ground floor and overhead glass walkways, surrounded by several deactivated landmines and security turrets. If engaging in combat with the scavs, Bana will refuse to open the door into the next area before all enemies are defeated.
In the next area, Bana directs V to a room in the back where he is hiding, but before V can enter, Ribakov jumps down from the ceiling with a smoke grenade and must be defeated first. Ribakov is equipped with optical camo and is able to charge jump to higher positions and use a Sandevistan to move quickly. Ribakov will use a sniper rifle while on the overhead catwalks, occasionally dropping a smoke grenade at his feet to disappear and reappear elsewhere. After half of his health is depleted, he will disappear into a smoke grenade, heal slightly, and deploy several Militech Griffin drones and won't return until they have been destroyed. From this point on he will fight on the ground using a Smart SMG, smoke grenades combined with flashbangs, and holographic decoys. Once defeated, Ribakov's Smart SMG Pizdets and the shard Contract Objective: Terminate Katya Karelina can be looted from his body.
Ana will contact V again and listen in after entering a hidden room where ""Bana"" is hiding, revealed to actually be a woman named Katya Karelina using a voice changer implant to impersonate Bana. She reveals that she interrogated the real Bana for SovOil before he died, but claims that she wasn't responsible for his death. Ana orders V to kill Katya before hanging up. V will then have the option to kill Katya outright, or make a deal with her to let her live in exchange for the location of a secret stash, starting Money For Nothing. She can still be killed after revealing the location of a secret stash. Regardless, V must now take Bana's biomonitor from Katya back to the Brazilian agents. On the way, Steven will text you to ask that you leave the biomonitor at a drop point instead, fearing that Ana will leak the circumstances of Bana's death, causing Brazil to lose out on a multibillion-eurodollar contract with SovOil and anger those involved in the deal. V can deposit the biomonitor at a marked drop point to end the gig immediately, or go back to the agents instead.
If V chooses to deliver the biomonitor to the agents:
Steven and Ana will be found packing up and preparing to leave while arguing over the fate of the biomonitor. Steven reveals that Brazil is actively holding talks with SovOil as they speak and that the agency knew that Bana was killed by SovOil, but has chosen to ignore it so as to not jeopardize the deal. Ana will state she fully intends to leak the data on the biomonitor to the media and the rest of the agency. V has the option to hand over the biomonitor or personally destroy it. The agent with whom V sided with give V their thanks, while the other will storm out and lean against a railing outside. Mr. Hands will contact V shortly afterwards to close the gig and send their payment.
If the biomonitor was delivered to the drop point or destroyed after talking to the agents:
Steven will text V after a few days, saying he is back in Night City, and asks to meet in Downtown, starting The Show Must Go On.
If the biomonitor was given to Ana:
After a few days, Steven can be found at EBM Petrochem Stadium by the Autofixer terminal, having joined BARGHEST as an analyst in order to lay low in Dogtown and is resentful of V for putting him in this situation. When asked, he reveals that Ana returned to Night City and was extradited back to Brazil where she is now imprisoned for treason, and that aside from ending the SovOil deal, the scandal resulted in a mid-level director at the agency being fired and Bana receiving a posthumous medal.","Go to the Paradise hotel.

Head to the furthest back room from the entrance, go up the collapsed part of the ceiling to get to the second level, and then to the only door on the left.

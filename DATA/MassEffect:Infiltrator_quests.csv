https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Colosseum,,"Randall finally faces X1
After his run into the X1 Wing, Randall Ezno arrives into a little area to fight against the first major boss of the game. This boss is the test subject X1, a mutated krogan with significant genetic and cybernetic augmentation in addition to a massive frame. X1 has also been enhanced with energy weapon gauntlets and in-built shield generators.
The key for success and ""Veteran"" final ranking is to deal a lot of damage to his armour rapidly and relentlessly: an evolved M-333 Particle Beam is the best way to achieve a decent damage output. When the damage is done, X1 will stagger and show his back, providing an opportunity to shoot at his shield generators. Do not wait and destroy them as soon as possible. You will need to repeat this several times.
Randall is trapped with X1
After a while, the Director will talk to Randall during his fight through the screen. Randall replies to the Director but the walls close in around Randall and X1, locking them in a smaller room. The fight starts again and X1 can break these walls and enwiden the battlefield.
The second part of the combat is similar to the first part. However, you must wait until X1 destroys at least one part of the wall in order to escape it. Secondly, X1 will charge you, although this attack doesn't deal too much damage, you still need to focus on your damage output in order to keep staggering him. When his shields are down, unleash all your damage output as fast as you can in order to quickly finish the fight.
When Randall finally defeats the modified krogan, he runs to the Communications Relay in order to contact the Alliance.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Security_Checkpoint,,"After his passage through the Med Bay, Randall is still following the advices of his volus ally who lead him to the outside of the facility.
Checkpoint 1[]
Randall in a dangerous corridor
Randall reaches the exterior of the facility through a corridor protected by several Orcus Mechs and Riot Troopers. This corridor is quite short and lacks advanced enemies or heavy security. The biotic abilities such as Pull or Leash should be kept to deal with the foes equipped with armored shields. However, you should be careful because troops will come, squad by squad, from every door in the corridor and if you run too fast, you can come under crossfire with no place to get into cover. Do not forget to switch weapons between each enemy and avoid every damage in order to receive the ""Veteran"" ranking.
At the far side of the corridor, Randall will have to equip an helmet in order to gain access to the outside Security Checkpoint.
Checkpoint 2[]
A too-quiet security platform
Randall arrives on an unusually silent platform and starts crossing it. When reaching the other side of the platform, he is caught in a Cerberus trap. An Ogre Mech appears in the center of the plateform to stop Randall's progression. In addition, an endless wave of Riot Troopers will approach Randall in close quarters to divert his attention from the first mini-boss he encounters.
The sniper rifle can be effective in hitting the heavy mech from a safe distance. Short range weapons and biotics, such as Pull or Leash are more useful against the Riot Troopers.
Randall will have to use his mobility to dodge mech attacks while also keeping track of the Riot Troopers' movements to avoid being overwhelmed. You should focus your fire on the head of the mech because If you do significant damage, it will lose its eye and the ability to target. This will cause it to fire its Storm Launcher in random directions, possibly harming its allies. Stay always in cover and use your Tactical Cloak if you are focused on by the mech or overwhelmed by the infantry. Do not hesitate to move to the other side of the platform, if pinned down.
If you want the ""Veteran"" final ranking, you have to kill at least two Riot Troopers by switching your weapons and powers in order to gain more style points. For the timing, the key is to have your weapons well upgraded in order to deal enough damage in a short time. Also, be advised than the mech can hit you with a lot of damage in a short time, easily making you lose one or two stars of the ""health"" ranking.
The level ends when Randall finally defeats the Ogre Mech and walks into the X1 Wing.

X1 Wing"
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/X1_Wing,,"Prisoners are slaughtered
In order to create a distraction, the Volus hacker unlocked strategic cells to liberate the prisoners of the Barn station. These asari and krogan test subjects will then rebel against the Cerberus employees and troopers of the facility. Randall needs to take that chance to reach the communication tower in order to contact the Alliance. He has to clear a bloody path through corridors and rooms of the X1 Wing who became warzones. During this chaos, the Director will taunt Randall via several holoscreens about Inali's fate and her growing addiction to the experiments. Randall does not want to believe him and keeps moving to his destination.
Checkpoint 1[]
While Randall proceeds into the X1 Wing, he arrives into a corridor full of enraged Krogan Prisoners. Three krogans will rush and charge you and force you to act quickly with your heavy and short range weapons or abilities to stay alive. It is recommended to send the krogans flying with a biotic Pull to render them helpless. If you are overwhelmed, your tech Cloak can save you, but it can lower your ranking if you took damage. In order to complete the ""Veteran"" medal you just have to act quickly and avoid all charges while you switch your weapon to perform each of the three kills.
Once the checkpoint is complete, you can get some credits in the room on your left before leading to the next checkpoint.
Checkpoint 2[]
Randall comes into a room opposing three Asari Prisoners and a single Cerberus engineer. The engineer will be killed very quickly by the prisoners. Those asari prisoners are dangerous because of their Assault Rifle and they are not easy to shoot due to their abundant cover. A good strategy consists of using your Cloak in order to enter the room and take a safe cover while you can shoot at the most dangerous asari with no risks.
When you enter the room, three Krogan Prisoners will also charge you. The biotic power Pull is once more highly really effective to deal with the krogans, especially to stop their violent charge. It is also recommended to use your heavy weapons to kill them as fast as possible to avoid asari fire if they are not taken into your biotic powers. After the deaths of the krogans it should be easy to deal with the remaining asaris. If you are overwhelmed during this fight, your tech Cloak can save you. However, do not loose too much time to get a top time ranking.
A ""safe"" deposit box
The ""Veteran"" medal is hard to get on this checkpoint because you need to act quickly and avoid all the ennemy fire brought to you by the asari while halting the krogans' charges. Do not forget to switch your weapons after each kill, especially for the remaining asari, to reach a good Style ranking. Once the checkpoint is complete you can get some credits in a safe case in the room on the left side of the next corridor.
Checkpoint 3[]
Randall enters into a large room transformed into a warzone opposing two Asari Prisoners and several Cerberus troopers covered by a single sniper at the opposite side of the room. Quickly, two more additional Krogan Prisoner will come in reinforcement for the test subjects by the right side of the room. Randall can either wait the end of the fight by staying hidden or join the battle and slaughter everyone in the room. However, it is recommended to enter the fight as fast as possible in order to score a better time ranking and to gain enough style points by switching your weapon after each kill in order to unlock the ""Veteran"" medal on this checkpoint.
When entering the room, do not hesitate to use your Cloak in order to reach a good spot where you can shoot at your opponents without attracting their attention. The fight is relatively easy because your foes will not focus on Randall, but rather concentrate fire at their respective adversaries. Use this opportunity to kill them without a risk. It is recommended to eliminate the marksman first because he is the most dangerous enemy when all prisoners have been taken down. The remaining troopers are not a real threat if you take them down from a safe spot. Be also advised that the two krogans can remain dangerous even if they have a priority on Cerberus troops. The classic biotic Pull is always an efficient way to deal with them.
An engineer in a bad situation
After the fight, Randall reaches a corridor where he can go forward into a small room to trigger a specific morality choice or take the left door to finish the checkpoint. If you choose the first option, you will face a Cerberus employee that you can spare or kill. After that you can take the credits lying on the console nearby. Randall will then lead to the next checkpoint while being taunted by the Director via the holoscreens about Inali's fate.
Checkpoint 4[]
The X1 Wing is overwhelmed and Cerberus is now sending more reinforcements which are waiting for you in this particularly long and dangerous checkpoint. This checkpoint is splitted into two dirrefent rooms with their own difficulties.
In the first room, you should enter with your Cloak because four Troopers and an Engineer are in position to welcome you with a deadly burst while no close cover is available. Once you find yourself behind cover, it is recommended to use abilities like an evolved Pull to avoid any damage. Remember to switch between your weapons to increase your Style. Another possibility includes killing several of those troopers in a row with the same weapon if you use the Pull in a good way. When this welcome committee is down, two other squads will arrive from the backdoor. The first wave is made of a Riot Trooper and an Engineer and the second of a Centurion and two other Riot Troopers. Use the classic strategies for those kind of enemies and act fast to terminate the first room in a safe way. When the last foe is dead, you should run to the second room to spare some time for your final ranking.
Taunted by the Director
The second room is more like a war zone because two Asari Prisoners are already fighting Cerberus troops and a Grad Turret. It is also suggested to enter carefully with your tech Cloak to avoid drawing attention. The large room and the two groups of opponent are separated by a wall, which the asari employ as cover. The Cerberus defenders are made of several troopers and an engineer covered by the turret. You should deal with the asari first (or the turret if you can avoid the attention of the asari) to improve your style points. Then it is recommended to use your tactical cloak while looking for cover. When you are into good cover, attack the turret between its burst with your shotgun, heavy weapon, or with a upgraded biotic Storm. Once this threat is eliminated, just shoot the remaining employees with several weapons or powers. Similarily to the first room of the checkpoint, two other squads will arrive from the back of the room. The first wave is made of two Riot Troopers and an Engineer and will come from the back door while the second consists of a centurion and a last engineer. Once more, use the classic strategies for those type of foes and act as fast as possible. Remember to avoid the damage and to increase your style point to reach a better ranking.
It is not so hard obtain the ""Veteran"" medal because you have more time for this checkpoint and you are allow to take some damage. However, you need to remain constant in the two parts of the checkpoint and achieve a good style ranking to get the best evaluation. When the fight is over, you can get some credits in the safe box and on the console before penetrating the next room.
Checkpoint 5[]
An obvious trap
Randall enters once again into a large, dark and all too quiet room where a smaller cell is present in the middle of the emplacement. This big room is particularly dangerous because it is protected by three automatic Grad Turrets. Randall will have to enter the small cell to push a button in order to move further. By pushing the button, the three turrets will appear encircling the cell: one on the left side, the second behind and the last on the right side of the cell. Their high damage output can easily kill Randall in a small amount of time or reduce his health ranking. Therefore, you will have to deal quickly and carefully with this threat to ensure a ""Veteran"" ranking.
Even if it appears safe, it is not recommended to stay in the cell while you fight the turrets because you will be surrounded and less protected by the walls. Then it is recommended to go out off the cell with your Cloak ability and hide in a safe spot. It is also suggested to begin with the left turret to avoid the fire of the two others, then you can go on the right side to destroy the second and then finish by the last one located behind the cell. The last one is the most dangerous because it is not easy to find a safe cover with a good view on it. In order to destroy those turrets, your high DPS weapons, such as the M-333 Particle Beams or the M-22 Eviscerator, will come in handy and should be used between the turrets' bursts. An evolved biotic storm can also be a very effective way to proceed. When you deal with the last turret, keep in mind that other troops will appear in the back of the room and you will need to be in cover when they come to avoid a quick death. Last but not least, do not hesitate to use your Cloak when you change position.
When the turrets are destroyed, three waves of Cerberus troops will appears in the back of the room. Those enemies are not really dangerous but are made of a wide variety of foes (Troopers, Riot Trooper, Centurions and even an Engineer) which can force you to use a different combo for each wave. At his moment, the small cell located in the center of the room can be a safe place to deal with those soldiers. Even if not particularly difficult, the troops will quickly appear and can also overwhelm you if you are not careful. It is then recommended to be in a good position when you destroy the last turret. Remember to alternate between weapons and use powers to increase Style points for a higher final ranking especially with the ground troops.
When the fight is over, you can get some credits from the safe box on the left side and then you just have to run forward in the next corridor.
Checkpoint 6[]
This last checkpoint is quite similar to the first except that you will face several mechs and because some of the krogans are carrying a M-333 Particle Beams which can be more deadly at long range. Randall will then enter in a deadly corridor where two enraged Krogan Prisoners are fighting a single Orcus Mech. Use this opportunity to quickly deal with those dangerous krogans with a classic biotic Pull for example. After the death of the two first krogans, a squad of three orcus mechs will appear on your left. Due to their low health and because their attention is drawn by the prisoner located in the back of the corridor, those mechs are not dangerous. You should also avoid to run too fast into the corridor or you could be caught in a cross fire.
Randall ready to enter the colosseum
In order to complete the ""veteran"" medal you just have to act quickly and avoid all krogan charges and beams while you switch your weapon to perform each kill. The death of the mechs are a good way to increase your style points so don't let the krogans kill them. After the ranking screen, Randall will once again be teased by the Director and will traverse a last corridor before the X1 chamber.

Colosseum"
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Medical_Bay,,"Inali's Office
Randall enters the Medical Bay and walks through the facility while Cerberus personnel are working as usual in order to reach Inali's office. In Inali's empty office the Director informs Randall that she has ""volunteered"" for a new project that Randall does not have security clearance to see. An unnamed volus contacts Randall after the Director ends the conversation. The volus warns Randall that Inali is in danger and that he will lend his assistance to find her. With his help, Randall gains access to the Medical Bay of the station.
Checkpoint 1[]
Listening to the advice of his new volus partner, Randall Ezno looks for Inali Renata in the Medical Bay of the Barn. His volus partner hacks the station's AI, UDI, to clear a path for Randall. Due to system failure, several Orcus Mechs attack Cerberus employees in the Medical Bay. Randall has to fight alongside those employees against the mechs in order to reach Inali.
Be careful—the mechs will pop out of the floor and then quickly arrive in front of you in groups of three. Try to kill each group in quick succession in order to improve your final ranking, and do not hesitate to switch your weapons between each group or each kill. You will need lots of style points to unlock the ""veteran"" rank.
Checkpoint 2[]
Experiment on a new implant
Randall will then enter another room to discover Inali being vivisected by the Director trying to implement new technology in her body. A window separates Randall from the scene, rendering him unable to take action. Randall swears to ""kill them all."" Before approaching the window, you will want to approach and raise some of the surgical tables from the floor (cover that pops out the floor usually signals only one thing).
After beginning the implantation process on Inali, the Director will disappear, but not before unleashing more Orcus Mechs on Randall. Be careful because the mechs immediately start spawning behind you and shooting, lowering your health and your final ranking if you don't take action. The Director unleashes three groups of mechs who will arrive through the door opposite from Inali's position. If you didn't raise tables for cover before, you can still do so. However, if you take cover behind them before they have moved yet, they will change position, and your cover will automatically be removed. As with the first checkpoint, try to kill each group in the same weapon cycle in order to improve your final ranking, and do not hesitate to switch your weapons between each group or each kill.
In addition to those mechs, Randall is now branded a hostile and every Cerberus employee and trooper on the station has been given orders to shoot him on sight. His volus partner says that it is possible for him and Inali to escape if he can find him. He also warns Randall that there are other test subjects who need Randall's help to be saved. Randall will now have to leave Inali in the Director's clutches to fight his way to the volus. Finally, Randall will meet a female Cerberus employee in a close room. There, you will be confronted by the first moral choice on the facility as you can either spare or kill her.
Checkpoint 3[]
Randall's new partner guides him through the Med Bay. Randall will return to whence he came and will finally arrive at a large corridor. Once there, Randall encounters and fights more Orcus Mechs and Troopers. Enemies will appear from the left side of the corridor by several doors and will then try to charge Randall's position. Advance carefully and slowly even if you think that one of the doors is safe because more Troopers can still arrive. You also need to quickly eliminate them to avoid an overwhelming and in order to increase your final ranking. Do not hesitate to use your melee abilities to push the Troopers back when they arrive too close to you. To reach the ""Veteran"" ranking, it is nearly impossible to kill multiple enemies in a row on this checkpoint. It is recommended to switch your weapon or your Biotics after each kill to gain more style points.
Hostage situation!
At the end of the checkpoint, the volus will also warn Randall that there are other test subjects. The volus wants to save them but needs and asks for Randall's help to do so. After this short discussion, Randall will continue his route. Before walking to the next checkpoint, you can take the left door at the end of the corridor to trigger a specific morality choice. There, you will face a Cerberus employee and his hostage, you can either spare the hostage or kill them both. After that you can take the credits lying on the console and then continue your playthrough to the next checkpoint.
Checkpoint 4[]
A tiny room full of boxes
Randall arrives at a room full of huge boxes and is attacked by a large numbers of Troopers and Orcus Mechs. The mechs will arrive by the right side of the room while more Troopers will come from a door in front of Randall. Such as for the checkpoint 3, it is nearly impossible to kill enemies in a row, on this checkpoint, except for groups of mechs and then it is recommended to switch your weapon or your Biotics after each kill to gain more style points in order to reach the ""Veteran"" ranking.
The difficulty of this room is that Troopers will try to hide behind the giant boxes which makes them particularly hard to hit without taking damage. When you have the opportunity, do no hesitate to Pull them when when they enter the combat zone. This will render them helpless and without protection or cover. It is also advisable to activate your Tactical Cloak when you are overwhelmed by troopers or mechs. It will be useful at least once in this tiny room.
During this onslaught, Randall kills his previous colleagues such as Biggs and Wedge. After the fight, the volus hacker will say that Randall must ""keep moving"" because he is close to his ""cell"", an old datacore.
Checkpoint 5[]
Randall's volus ally is scared
After a struggle between the volus hacker and the station AI, UDI, Randall arrives in an old datacore where the volus is held. Randall will exchange some words with the volus, but UDI retakes control and initiates a lockdown of the room.
This situation will lead to a major fight against more Orcus Mechs, Engineers and a Centurion. The volus will be scared and Randall will have to struggle in order to stay alive.
What makes this fight difficult is that the enemies enter from three different doors and you will have to move often in order to find decent cover. Your tech power, Cloak, is very useful for moving from a spot to another while avoiding enemy fire. The enemies encountered in the zone are not resilient but be advised that the Engineers will try to flank you and can deal enough damage to reduce your final ranking. It is also necessary to switch weapons after each easy kill to accumulate enough style points for the ""Veteran"" rank.
When the lesser enemies have fallen, a Centurion will appear and will often stay in cover making him difficult to reach. Use your biotics to immobilize him and perform a fast and safe kill to ensure a better final ranking.
When the fight is over, Randall will then run to the top of the facility through the Security Checkpoint in order to reach the Comm Relay.

Security Checkpoint"
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Comm_Relay,,"After his fight against X1, Randall, guided by his volus ally, will take an elevator to the outside in order to find the communication tower and therefore send a message to the Alliance.
Checkpoint 1[]
Randall is ready to fight
Once Randall arrives on the outside with an obligatory helmet, he will have to cross some sort of bridge to access an upper level. When he moves to that direction, several Assault Troopers will jump on him with their personal jetpacks and begin a powerful assault. In addition, a sniper will cover the assault troopers from the upper level. It is advice to shoot the closest soldier and then directly take care of the sniper to avoid an instakill. A biotic Pull in addition of the M-29 Incisor is certainly the best and the safest way to disable this specific threat.
Be careful because more and more Assault Troopers will arrive on the zone to replace their fallen teammates. It is then advice to advance slowly and carefully if you want to perform three stars on your remaining health at the end of the Checkpoint. For the time stars, focus on making fast kill instead of trying to run.
When the troops stop arriving on the bridge, you can go to the upper level where other troopers and Riot Troopers will wait for you. Once again, be careful because no easy cover is available to make safe kill. It is then recommended to use your biotics power or your Cloak to perform the kills without a risk.
When you finally arrives on the upper level, do not forget to search for credits on the computer consoles and then run to the door. A last group of enemies will try to block the access to Randall but they can be easily kill with your classic weapons. Do not forget that you have to perform fast kill with different type of weapons in order to perform the ""veteran"" rank.
Checkpoint 2[]
Snipers towers
When Randall begins this checkpoint, he will be surrounded by two towers, one in front of him and the second on his right, protected by one sniper each while a squad of three Riot Troopers are rushing at him from his left side. This situation is dangerous because you are located in an open space, fortunately, some walls will appears from the ground where you will be able to take cover. However, enemy fire can easily destroy this weak cover forcing you to act faster.
The two snipers are the most dangerous threat because of their Assassination skill. A M-29 Incisor and/or several biotic Pull are necessary to deal with them. Be careful because the riot troopers will quickly arrive near you and you will need another Pull to put their shields on the ground. A Leash, a powerful biotic Storm, your shotgun or a combination of the three can also be effective to deal with those shields. It is also suggested to keep your tactical Cloak in order to gain some time if you need to reload your biotic powers cool down.
After that, an other squad of three riot troopers leaded by a Centurion will arrive from the right door in the back of the platform. You will have time to easily deal with them because they are far from you. However, do not loose to much time in order to improve your time rating. For the ""veteran"" ranking, remember to use different weapons and powers for each kill.
Checkpoint 3[]
At the beginning, Randall will be welcomed by a centurion and a trooper covered by two snipers. The troopers will try to flank you when the snipers will wait an opportunity to deplete your shield and even a part of your health. Once more, a M-29 Incisor and a biotic Pull are necessary to deal with them. When you elaborate your strategy, keep in mind that the centurion is really close to you and can deal a large amount of damage such as the snipers.
Cerberus is no match for Randall
When those enemies are dealt with, five Assault Troopers will come from the sky with their jet pack to replace them. Be advice that they are equipped with Assault rifles or shotguns. They are then deadly at both mid and short range. When they are eliminated, two last troopers leaded by a centurion will come from the front door to try a last blockade. This last squad is not really dangerous and appears in a ""pack"", a biotic storm can be useful.
For the ""veteran"" evaluation, do not forget that it is easy to kill the reinforcement squads in a row with the same weapon to improve your style. Act also as fast as possible and avoid all damage from the welcome committee and you will be rewarded with the gold medal.
Checkpoint 4[]
In this checkpoint, similar to the second of this mission, Randall will face a tower overlooking a round and exposed platform. A snipers defend the tower while three Assault Troopers ans a Centurion will try to flank you. The sniper is particularly hard to eliminate because he is out of range for your biotic abilities. You will then have to get closer to deal with him or try to shoot him with your sniper rifle but it is recommended to get closer.
During this phase the assault troopers can make huge damage and can also pin you down if you are not carefully, your tactical Cloak and your Pull will be your best allies in order to slow them down or to hide your character for a while. Do not forget that those units are way more resilient than classic troopers and that their shield will rapidly replenish. In a later phase, a new sniper will replace the dead one at the same spot and three others squad of assault troopers will come as reinforcement from the sky. They will come in number and will really do all they can to surround you. Act quickly and avoid the overwhelming at all cost with a good cover, preferably in the right side of the map. For the third and last squad, you will face the only Assault Captain of the game who lead four others assault troopers. Deal with them like the others but be advice that the captain will rush you with his deadly shotgun.
The ""veteran"" medal is quite easy to get because you can take several damage and loose many time before loosing a star. Do not forget to pay attention to your style points. When all forces are eliminated, go to the door on the left of the tower without forgetting the credits lying on the console on the right side of this door.
Checkpoint 5[]
Randall finally reach the comm relay
When Randall will enter this checkpoint, the volus hacker will contact him to say that the communication relay is just ahead. The volus asks Randall to activate the console in front of him but he will need to fight the defenders in order to reach this position.
This zone is an outside platform where Randall begins in a low position while several ground Cerberus troops will start firing at him from their safe spot. It is recommended to run on the right stair to reach a better position. You can also use your cloak to avoid enemy fire while you reach a safe cover. When you are in cover you will face several troopers and two snipers. This particular spot is hard because as usual, the front troopers will try to flank you while the snipers are firing at your when you move out of cover. Use your powers and a wide type of weapons to deal with them and increase your style points. When those forces are eliminated, two squads of enemies will appear by elevator on the right and on the left side of the communication tower. Once more, deal with them without taking damage and with different weapons if you want to get the ""veteran"" ranking. The most dangerous enemies are the Riot Troopers which will quickly come from the right side and overwhelm you. A biotic pull or an evolved storm are two effective power against those foes.
A message to the Alliance
When the threat has been destroyed, you will be able to send your message to the Systems Alliance. Push the two buttons on the side of the console and then on the main button in the center. The communication relay tower will then be activated and a contact with the Alliance will be done. When the message is sent, stay sharp because you will directly be attacked by powerful enemies.
Checkpoint 6[]
When the message is sent, the tower relay defenses will be activated and a Ogre Mech will come on the center of the platform and will attack you. While you are fighting, a Geth Dropship will attack the facility and will send several geth troops on the battlefield. Those new synthetics enemies will attack both Randall and the mech. In this part, Randall is stuck near the tower and can both go on the left or the right catwalk where Geth Troopers were dropped or he can also go down by the stairs to meet the heavy mech deployed by Cerberus.
It is suggested to stay near the console if you are close enough to shoot at the ogre mech. The ogre mech is not really dangerous because its attention is drawned by geth troopers when they arrive. It is then necessary to let some of them live when you shoot the mech. Be careful because a single Geth Juggernaut will appear on your back with his powerful shogun, deal with him quickly when the others enemies are fighting each others. After that you will have to take the mech down pin downed by geth trooper. To do that and to avoid geth fire you should clean up one of the catwalk when the other side shoot the mech. When you can, shoot the mech in the eye to make him blind as fast as you can, use your heavy weapons and powers. If you attract the attention of the mech or of the geths, just use your cloak to cool down the situation. In order to get the best ranking, do not forget to kill as much as geths as possible with different weapons to increase your style.
For the gold ranking, you will also have to avoid the huge damage that can be inflicted by the heavy foes of the checkpoint. While the geth troopers on the catwalks and the mech will not really attack you, two other geth Juggernauts will spawn behing you near the console of the communication tower and the squad of geth on the catwalk will also be replaced by dropped units. When a Juggernaut is dropped, act as fast as you can and shoot it with your evolved M-22 Eviscerator to avoid their huge damage. Once more, do not forget that the ogre mech can lower your health ranking if he is able to hit you when he is not focusing the geth forces.
A new mission given by the volus
When all forces are eliminated, Randall will have to reach the rendezvous point of the Alliance on LV426, a nearby desert planet. Randall will be tasked by the volus to steal a shuttle in the Hangar Bay of the Barn. You will now go on the center of the platform and take the elevator of the Ogre mech to go inside the station and pass through the Access Corridor.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Desert_Planet,,"Randall Ezno managed to steal a shuttle in order to reach a nearby desert planet, LV426. Once there, he walks in a Cerberus outpost for the pickup organized by the Systems Alliance.
LV426, the desert planet, seen from space
In  this outpost, Randall is trapped by the Director. He encounters a heavily modified Inali Renata deployed by his enemy. The huskified Inali fights Randall with her assault rifle and powerful biotic attacks, such as Salvo. She can also use her tactical cloak and fast movement speed to fool with him. Randall will have to move from cover to cover and act quickly in order to stand a chance against her.
You should try to stay in cover as much as you can to avoid Inali's biotic Salvo and her gunfire. Inali will always try to flank you when using her tactical Cloak and her flying abilities, it is then recommended to move from cover to cover and take a shot while she is quiet. Keep your own Cloak when the situation become too dangerous and that you risk to be overrun by Inali. Finally, try to keep firing because she will quickly regenerate her barrier if she doesn't take damage.

Bonus Missions[]
The following mission represents plot progression. It has no time limit, but it uses the Checkpoints system.
The mission features the story of an unnamed turian after his capture by Randall Ezno.
Incarceration (6 Checkpoints) – Escape the facility with the unnamed turian test subject."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Incarceration,,"The awakening
The turian target of Randall Ezno is now prisoner of Cerberus on the Barn space station. He is now attached to an operating table for experimentation.
During the escape of his former hunter, an alarm sounds in his cell. The actions of Randall and his Volus ally released all of the test subjects and the facility is in bedlam. The guard of the turian is killed, and he feels his strength returning. The turian will then grab a weapon to escape the facility.
As a general note, getting the ""veteran"" rank for the checkpoints of this bonus mission is much harder than in the main plot. Due to limited arsenal and powers, even finishing the mission a challenge. To get veteran rank, you will have to find a balance between speed and caution to avoid any damage in order to ensure high time and health rankings. A good knowledge of the level and the adversaries that you will encounter at each point is then necessary to achieve the perfect run. It is also important to use your tech power Cloak at the right moments. It should be used to take strategic cover or to safely shoot a dangerous enemy, rather than as a backup mechanism in case of danger. Its cooldown is too high and its duration too low to rely on frequently. Finally, your style ranking will be hard to improve due to the limited arsenal at your disposal. Except for the weakest ones, it will be extremely difficult to shoot several enemies in a row because your weapon will quickly overheat. There is no way to upgrade that which improves weapon recharge times. If you want to improve your style, it is necessary to switch weapons after each enemy. Choose which enemies to eliminate with the assault rifle versus the shotgun by taking their respective range into account. Finally, due to the lack of biotics and weak firepower, armored targets such as Riot Troopers or Krogan Prisoners will require perfect aim to kill in a short period of time.
Checkpoint 1[]
Orcus Mechs at the door
After his awakening, the turian shoots his way past Cerberus troops and other escaped test subjects shooting at each other in order to escape the facility. The first checkpoint of this bonus mission is divided into 3 main corridors.
In the first zone, Asari Prisoners are fighting a squad of Orcus Mech supported by one engineer. You can find some credits on the small room on your right or you can directly confront your adversaries. When they are eliminated take the credits in the room in front of you and then you can go on the  right corridor protected by a Grad Turret and another squad of three mechs.
After that, a third large corridor is available on your right where you will encounter six mechs, one engineer and one trooper. When they are dealt with, two riot troopers and another trooper will also appear at the end of the corridor. If you come too close a second turret will spawn from the roof to support them. It is recommended to advance carefully by killing the riot troopers before approaching the tower. When everybody is annihilated, three last riot troopers covered by a single trooper will come one by one to stop you. When the checkpoint is over, you can take the credits on the room on your right before taking the elevator to the next checkpoint.
Checkpoint 2[]
Automatic defenses
You will directly arrive on a platform in the back of two patrolling troopers. Use the surprise for easy kills. When you advance in the checkpoint a trooper protected by a large crate will ambush you and more reinforcements will arrive behind him. A riot trooper and several troopers protected by a sniper will then fire at you. Fortunately, a Krogan Prisoner arrives on their back during the fight. Use that distraction at your advantage by killing the most dangerous adversaries like the riot trooper and the sniper. This checkpoint is cleared when the last of those foes is eliminated.
You will be able to reach two destroyed rooms that were used for experiments. In there, credits can be found in safe a deposit box and on a console before reaching the third checkpoint.
Checkpoint 3[]
In the next room three asari prisoners will attack you. When they are eliminated a last asari and two krogans will come from the left door. Because they come one by one, they are not a real threat for you. However be advised that they will rush at you and that the krogan's charge can be deadly if not avoided. When the room is cleared the checkpoint is finished and you can advance to the next one.
Checkpoint 4[]
Looking for a way out
In the corridor on your left you will encounter three other asaris who will try to stop you. They are well protected by the crate but you can go close to the first to melee her or you can shoot in the canister to make them explode. The explosion will deal some damage and will throw them out of cover. When they are dealt with, a krogan equipped with a powerful M-333 Particle Beam will come from the front door while a squad of Orcus mech will arrive from the right. It is recommended to keep a good distance between them because they will distract each others. When they are all destroyed you can reach the corridor on your left or take the credits lying in the front room.
This corridor is protected by a Centurion and a trooper. Once more, they are not easy to hit due to their good cover and due to the lack of biotics. After that, you will arrive on another corridor defended by a large squad of troopers. They are well covered while your protective wall can be broken. Keep moving to kill the distance between you and them. After a moment, three riot troopers and a centurion will arrive as reinforcement. Keep your shotgun to quickly eliminate the two closest riot troopers. In addition to that, a sniper recognizable by his red beam will be located in the end of the corridor. This dangerous enemy can kill you in one shot and it is then needed to stay out of his sight. Your cloak can be useful to move from one spot to another or to kill this sniper without taking any damage from other adversaries. When the last enemy of this corridor have fallen, this checkpoint is finally completed and you can head to the upcoming zone.
Checkpoint 5[]
A long fight
For the fifth checkpoint, you enter a large hall transformed in a real warzone where Cerberus troops are fighting the released prisoners. At your arrival, a trooper and a sniper located on your left are shooting a krogan in the middle of the hall. In addition, asaris prisoners are hidden on your right in a small inner room to cover the krogan. You can either let them shoot each other’s or you can engage the fight to finish the checkpoint faster or to improve your style points. In both case, use the conflict between the two belligerents at your advantage. Be advice that the krogan will rush you if he sees you when you enter the hall, your tactical can then be advisable.
In one hand, when the first prisoners have fallen three other krogans will appear from the right door of the hall. On the other hand, the first Cerberus troops will be replaced by more troopers, riot troopers, an engineer, another sniper and one centurion coming from your front side. The krogans can engage the remaining Cerberus troops if you let them live long enough and if you do not draw attention. It is highly recommended to use such a distraction to avoid any damage.  In this part, use your tactical cloak as much as you can to remain hidden and to assassinate the good target while you improve your style ranking. Be also advice that as usual, the riot trooper will try to flank you when others adversaries, including the sniper, will fire at you.
Checkpoint 6[]
The beginning of the end
On this last checkpoint, the fight culminating in a confrontation with an Ogre Mech and an endless supply of Orcus Mechs. This fight is particularly difficult due to your low firepower. To win this, it is necessary to eliminate the small Orcus Mechs as fast as you can to not become overwhelmed by too much adversaries at once. Do not forget to use those small mech to improve your style ranking if needed. It is also recommended to use your cloak as much as you can to deal heavy damage with your shotgun to the ogre mech's weak spots. For the rest, keep moving and avoid special attack from the mech to stay alive during this long fight. Be also advice that you have plenty of time to kill this enemy even if you want the veteran rank (more than ten minutes) but that you have to avoid lots of damage to get the best ""health"" result.
Eventually you reach a large, empty room. Upon moving to the far wall, you can see the Director and several Cerberus personnel on the other side of a window. The Director laughs at you as a turret deploys in the room. With no available cover, the view fades to black. There's no escape and the bonus mission is completed.

https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Hangar_Bay,,"After his mission on the Ice Giant, Randall Ezno returns in his shuttle to the Cerberus station, the Barn.
Checkpoint 1[]
Randall's arrival on the Barn station
Randall starts a radio communication with Inali Renata and walks through the Hangar Bay in order to reach Inali's office for a medical diagnostic. Then the Hangar is suddenly attacked by Turian Troopers, presumably dispatched by the Turian Hierarchy. With the help of Cerberus troops, Randall cleans out the Hangar.
Instead of walking directly to the elevator, walk around both side walls of the hangar to collect money. There are a few consoles and wall safes that will yield 50 credits each. When Randall reaches the elevator, combat will immediately ensue with a Turian Trooper popping out and attacking. Dispatch the enemy quickly, then turn around toward the main part of the hangar. Friendly Orcus Mechs will be trying to deter the invaders, but they aren't too much help—the turians destroy them fairly easily.
In order to obtain the ""veteran"" medal, you need to quickly dispatch the enemies, but not much cover is available in the beginning of the fight. Therefore, you must advance carefully and try to wait for other Cerberus troops to engage the enemy before joining the fight yourself. Nevertheless, those enemies will not be a real threat due to their comparatively low numbers and lack of cover on their end.
As soon as you take out the first three enemies across the back of the Hangar Bay from your position, it should be safe to run for the crates in the middle to take cover. Move forward from cover to cover, taking out the turians ahead (who are usually distracted) along the way. Remember to change weapons and use powers to increase style points.
Checkpoint 2[]
Cerberus troops in the Hangar Bay of the Barn
Inali contacts Randall once more and tries to tell him something but the communication is suddenly cut. Randall will begin to worry about her and will run to Inali's office.
During his run, other turian troops will attack the hangar. Turian Snipers will start to scope at the player and you need to take cover to avoid a lethal hit from those snipers. UDI, Barn station's AI, will open a door after 10 seconds to access a corridor full of turian troops. While you wait for the door to open, you can begin to shoot turians with your sniper rifle, if you've purchased it. Once more, the turian Troopers are not really dangerous individually, but Snipers should be prioritized and targeted with biotic abilities, as their rifles can easily kill you with one shot. Two friendly Cerberus troopers will assist you in fighting against the invaders if they are saved from the sniper. As they possess higher health, shields and accuracy than the Turians they can be valuable allies. There is plenty of cover to navigate between, just be sure to duck behind cover when you see a targeting laser to avoid the Snipers' shots.
After receiving your Combat Analysis, Randall gains access to the Medical Bay of the station. There should be a couple consoles and wall safes to exploit for 50 credits each. Move on to try to meet Inali.

Missions

Medical Bay"
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_Giant,,"The ice giant, seen from space
Aboard his shuttle, Randall arrives on an unknown ice planet to complete his assignment. After a short briefing by Inali, Randall begins his first mission in the field with his new implants. This mission serves as a tutorial for the gameplay mechanics.
Checkpoint 1[]
Inali's briefing
Inali warns you about a Geth Dropship and geth signatures. Walk forward to the first indicator that shows where you need to take cover, then swipe forward by the left edge of the screen to vault over it. Inali then tells you how to use the aiming system. At first only one Geth Trooper appears, after which more appear in pairs as the first is taken out. They can all be dispatched from cover. Since they take cover often, they can easily be either rushed, Pushed out and shotgunned, or alternatively plucked from cover with Pull and shot from a distance. Try a combination of both strategies to achieve a higher Style rating in the Combat Analysis.
Checkpoint 2[]
After finishing the first group, Inali tells you to stay in cover as often as possible, to which Randall sarcastically responds, ""Gee, ya think?"". Following her advice will facilitate earning three Health stars, as you will avoid gunfire.
Walk over the bridge toward the closed door, which will open at Randall's approach. Another orange arrow indicates the nearest cover. More geth are on the way: the first appears by a nearby cover to the right, and more appear in pairs behind the cover ahead. There are a few options:
Stay in the initial cover and take the Troopers out from afar, using your assault rifle and sniper rifle (if purchased) on them after you've Pulled or Leashed (if purchased) them out of cover.
Since they hide in cover and don't move from their position, roll from cover to cover, then use push and your shotgun. Alternate with the assault rifle to earn a higher score.
If you're replaying this checkpoint with upgraded abilities, you can run around wreaking havoc with Charge, Slide and melee attacks.
Checkpoint 3[]
The base on the Ice Giant
Walk toward the next closed door while Inali comments on Randall's implants—he has more than any other subject. Randall replies, ""Well, more than any human subject,"" alluding to Cerberus' other experiments.
Run toward the first cover after the door opens; Geth Troopers start appearing behind the cover ahead. Use Cloak as instructed to sneak toward them, but don't get ahead of yourself, as taking out the first three Troopers causes a Geth Juggernaut to spawn. The Juggernaut is more vulnerable to the shotgun, so switch to that and be sure to hit the head. Use Cloak to get to better cover, if needed.
After the Juggernaut is down, two more Troopers on the right need to be taken out before the gate drops. Run into the next orange indicator to spawn more Geth Troopers. One conveniently appears right behind the cover you just got into, so target it first to use Push, then shoot it. The other two can be taken out as you've done before. Keep moving through the newly opened gate.
More Troopers pop up by the cover ahead. Don't get too far ahead since a Juggernaut and Troopers will appear from the left corner. The Troopers will attempt to flank you, so it's best to ragdoll them with Pull and take them out before they do so. Since they move faster than the Juggernaut, try to take them out before dealing with the heavy unit.
Checkpoint 4[]
Randall captures his target
Move through the door ahead to the left, and run toward the first cover—the action is already going. A Geth Juggernaut will be the first to target you, but keep an eye on the Turian Sniper's targeting laser. Stay in cover and take out the many Geth Troopers and the two Geth Juggernauts on the lower level, then use Leash or Pull to finish off the sniper. After doing so, approach the overwatch, but don't run up the ramp right away, as a Juggernaut will spawn as you approach. Conveniently, there's a cover right at the bottom of the ramp. Take out the Juggernaut, then deal with the target. The turian tends to hide behind cover and run away when you close in, so you'll need longer-range weapons and powers to finish him. Remember to change weapons and use powers to increase Style points for a higher final ranking.
After defeating the target, Randall has a choice of how to deal with his capture. He will then drag the turian back to the shuttle to head back to the home base, the Barn.
Later, the captured turian will attempt escape during Randall's disruption on the Cerberus base.

Hangar Bay"
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Access_Corridor,,"With the message sent, Randall arrives in the access tunnels but he will encounter an heavy resistance when the alarm will sound loud and the emergency red lighting will be activated.
Checkpoint 1[]
Alert on the Barn
Due to this alarm, the synthetics defensive forces of the station are in alert and are ready to eliminate every threats presents on the facility. When Randall goes out of the relay's elevator, he enters into a large corridor where a Grad Turret is shooting at two helpless Geth Troopers. Profit of this opportunity to take cover and start shooting at the dangerous turret. When the geth forces are eliminated, a second grad turret will appear in the end of the corridor and four squad of three Orcus Mechs each will attack you, one by one. Those enemies are relatively weak and will not pose a hard resistance except for the second turret which can be hard to aim. Your sniper is then very helpful in this situation.
The ""veteran"" rank on this checkpoint is easy to get if you can avoid turret's bullets and if you kill the mech's squads in a row or with different weapons. Keep in mind that zone power such as Storm are effective against grouped foes.
When those forces are eliminated, you can grab some easy money on several wall safes and consoles during the course to the next checkpoint. During this time, the Director will explain his plan for human race that Randall will ignore while the alarm system switches off.
Checkpoint 2[]
When you arrive in the new room, divided in two corridors, a Krogan Prisoner is fighting against a squad of three Orcus Mechs. Those mechs will quickly be destroyed because they are no match for the armored and well equipped krogan. When you take part in the fight, the emergency red lighting will be activated and two others krogans, also equipped with the powerful M-333 Particle Beam, will appear on the left side of the room while two others squads of mechs will also enter in action by the right corridor of the room.
Except for the resilience of the krogans, the enemies present on this checkpoint are not a real threat if you act with caution and if you keep in mind that the right corridor is protected by two powerful Grad Turrets. It is then recommended to kill the moving foes before attacking the turrets. You can easily do that by waiting the foes in the left corridor.
Taunted by the Director
Like the first checkpoint, the ""veteran"" rank is easy to get if you can avoid turret's bullets and if you kill the mech's squads yourself with style. Moreover, the krogans are not so dangerous because they will focus their fire against the mechs and will then not charge at you.
When the Cerberus' defenses are destroyed, the emergency red lighting are turned off and the Director will taunt you and the volus hacker will warn Randall via the radio that the geths deployed from the Comm Relay are now everywhere in the station.
Checkpoint 3[]
In this checkpoint you will enter in a large corridor where a squad of three Geth Troopers is moving to his target. You are behind them use that to your advantage in order to eliminate those week foes with style. After that, another squad of three geths will appear in the end of the corridor. They are more dangerous and are into cover. However your sniper rifle and a well placed biotic pull can easily deal with them. When the two geth squads are eliminated, you can go in the room of the left side in the end of the corridor to grab some credits before to run in the second part of the checkpoint located on the right side of the corridor. Do not forget to run as fast as possible from a spot to another in order to ensure a top ""time"" ranking.
Geth on the station
When you pass the door, Randall will face another geth squad composed of two troopers and a dangerous Geth Juggernaut. Stay in cover and use your shotgun or your heavy beam weapon to deal with this threat. To ensure your gold medal, you must avoid any damage and switch your weapons to increase your style. Your Cloak can be useful to shoot the Juggernaut without drawing attention. When the enemies are dealt with, run quickly to the last part of the checkpoint.
There, a single geth trooper located on the left side of the room is fighting against two Cerberus troopers and a Riot Trooper at your right side. It is recommended to focus your fire against Cerberus troops while their attention is attracted by the geth. Those units can be easily eliminated if you take care and if you use the right power against the shielded Cerberus enemy. After that, your way is clear for the next corridor.
Checkpoint 4[]
This checkpoint is particularly long because you will have to cross three rooms before the final evaluation. However, the gold ranking for this evaluation is not so hard to unlock if you run from room to room and if you can avoid most of the damage and if you remember to kill enemies with style. In fact, there is none heavy or dangerous foes except maybe the two Cerberus snipers.
The first room is a large corridor where two troopers and a single sniper, awakened by the alarm, will shoot at you. Be careful because you will have to run straightforward in order to reach the enemies while you are surrounded by explosive cans. It is then recommended to shoot each of those before to go forward to avoid a dangerous explosion. When you advance cover from cover, keep in mind that the little wall in the center of the corridor can be broken by enemy fire if you stay too long in one spot. Another strategy is to use your cloak to cross the corridor safely. When the three first foes are eliminated a single Riot Trooper will also try to stop you.
The second room is more dangerous because it is smaller and the enemies are well protected behind several huge boxes. It is recommended to find a good cover before attempting any kill. When you arrive in it, four Cerberus troopers will welcome you and two others riot troopers will come in reinforcement after a while. Use the classic strategy to deal with them and do not let them arrive close to you with their shields.
Cerberus tries to resist
Finally you will encounter a last heavy resistance pocket in a last large room. There four troopers, one riot trooper and one sniper will try to stop you. Nothing is here really dangerous except their numbers forcing you to act quickly if you want to avoid their fire power. Your cloak is once more a good solution to kill safely the first of them. When you kill them, do not forget your style if you want the ""veteran"" rank.
After those fights, the alarm will shut down and the light will turn white once more. You have now the time to collect several credits lying around. After that, you will once more enter into the Hangar Bay of the Barn to steal the shuttle you need for your escape.
Checkpoint 5[]
The hangar bay
This time, Randall will enter on the upper platform of the Hangar Bay. You will directly arrive behind two patrolling troopers. Use the surprise element at your advantage and kill them before they can face you. Be extremely careful because a dangerous sniper is located on the other platform. it is recommended to kill instead of running. Be advice that nothing can reach him except your M-29 Incisor sniper rifle. When those threats are dealt with, two Assault Troopers will jump on the platform with their jetpack to attack you, eliminate them and take the door in front of you. If you want some credits, a safe deposit box is available on the right side of this door.
When you pass the door another squad of three assault troopers will arrive in front of you. Use your biotic abilities to  quickly deal with them. After that, a squad of three Riot Troopers leaded by a single Centurion will come from the elevator in front of you. As always, a biotic pull or storm can be very effective with the shielded enemies. When they are all dead you can pursue your trajectory in order to reach the elevator.
Before to take this elevator, a sniper located on your left and protected by one trooper and one engineer will try to stop you. Eliminate them with your sniper rifle and you will be able to finally take the elevator. If needed, a second safe box is available near the sniper's corpse.
Due to the huge number of enemies on this checkpoint, the veteran rank is quite easy to get if you can avoid most of the damage and if you check at your style ranking.
Checkpoint 6[]
A shuttle to leave the Barn
Randall is now really close to his shuttle but he will have to fight his way one last time against Cerberus defenses. In the hangar, four Troopers supported by a strong Ogre Mech are waiting for you. This part of the checkpoint is the hardest because enemies will focus their fire on Randall and no good cover is available near the entrance point. It is the recommended to use your tactical cloak to reach a safe post before engaging the combat. Then you will have to quickly deal with the troopers while you need to avoid the dangerous firepower of the mech. Be also advice that the mech is far from you and is then not easy to reach except with your biotics or your sniper rifle.
Fortunately, when the troopers are eliminated, a squad of two Riot Troopers and a single trooper leaded by a Centurion will come into the fight from the right side of the hangar. Their arrival is fortunate because they will start to shoot at the mech and its attention will be attracted by them. Use this delay to reload your powers and to find a good position. When you are back in combat, eliminate all threats without forgetting your style ranking if you want the gold final ranking.
When most of the enemies are down, a Geth Dropship will arrive from the space and will drop two Geth Troopers and two Geth Juggernaut. Be careful because the juggernaut will rush at you and will try to flank you, focus your fire on them before than can do so. Once more, your cloak can save you if you are in a bad situation. When the juggernaut are advancing to you, several cerberus squads of Assault Troopers will come in reinforcement to defend the hangar from both side. Once more, use them to drawn enemy fire and increase your ""health"" ranking. Deal with the enemy one by one with your style points in mind and the veteran rank will be unlocked. When most of troops are dealt with, a last squad of geths compound with one single geth trooper and three geth juggernaut will land on the platform while more cerberus assault squad will also come. Once more, be careful because the juggernaut will try to flank you even if cerberus troops are shooting at them. It is then recommended to stay far from the war zone to avoid the fire.
When all forces are eliminated, you can grab some credits lying in the hangar behind the cerberus fighters and then you can take the shuttle to reach LV426, your rendezvous point with the alliance. Your volus ally will then wish you luck when you start the engines and cut the communication.

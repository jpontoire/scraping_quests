In the morning, Aloy finds Rost overlooking the Embrace, clearly troubled by something. After some prying, Rost tells her that he has a final lesson: he instructs her to gather the parts for Fire Arrows and to meet him at the Northern Embrace Gate.
Aloy retrieves the parts for Fire Arrows from a herd of Striders in the valley. Before meeting Rost at the gate, she meets with Karst, a merchant willing to
Karst is a member of the Nora tribe who ignores the rules to shun outcasts. Aloy meets up with him at his home near Mother's Cradle and trades him a Scrapper Lens for a Tripcaster. After Aloy accomplishes these two tasks, she meets Rost at the North Gate where they are greeted by a gruesome post-battle scene with the corpses of Sawtooths and Nora Braves. Rost points to a lone Sawtooth still prowling about and Aloy dispatches it on her own.
Rost reveals that the real lesson of the hunt was for Aloy to place importance on the protection of the Nora tribe and their hunting lands, not purely on her own benefit.","Find Rost

He tells her to meet High Matriarch Teersa who will lead her through an annual festival before the start of the Proving. Before she enters the city, Rost tells her that he will not see her again. She pleads with him to reconsider his words, but Rost assures her that her acceptance into the tribe will lead to the answers she seeks. The front gate guards of Mother's Heart attempt to turn her away before Teersa intervenes.
The city is bustling due to the arrival of envoys from the Sundom, who have visited the Nora lands for the first time in several years. Teersa also tells Aloy that an ""old friend"" is waiting for her. Turns out, it is Teb, the young Nora brave she saved during the events of Lessons of the Wild. Teb is now a Stitcher and gives her the Nora Brave armor as a long overdue thanks. Karst can also be found in Mother's Heart and wishes Aloy the best of luck in the Proving.
As Aloy continues enjoying the festivities, she notices the foreign envoys are being given a rough reception by the Nora crowd due to the bloody history between the tribes. Erend, an Oseram, calms them when he explains that the Carja Sun-Priest Irid is attempting to apologize for the capturing, killing, and slavery that occurred under the former Sun-King, Jiran. Aloy spots a strange man named Olin wearing a Focus in the crowd. She briefly chats with him before being introduced to Erend.
Afterward, Aloy takes part in a prayer lantern ceremony that officially starts the events of the Proving. Night falls and Aloy finds the lodge, where she meets Resh, a guard who makes his distaste for her perfectly clear. While preparing for bed, Aloy butts heads with Bast and meets Vala, another Nora who wishes to win the Proving.","Talk to Rost. He'll be waiting for you near Mother's Heart.

https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/The_Proving,Main_quests,"Aloy, Bast, Vala, and other Nora follow Resh to the Proving grounds. The ceremony begins with the initiates rock climbing to the starting area. Then there is a hunting test. A horde of Grazers stampede into the grounds and the initiates must kill one and collect their trophy before moving on. Aloy kills a Grazer, but Bast destroys her trophy. She falls behind the others, but kills a second Grazer and collects another trophy to move on.
The second part of the Proving is to cross the Brave Trail, a perilous mountain pathway filled with chasms and other obstacles. Aloy, having already fallen considerably behind, makes a desperate move to cross an old crumbling trail that takes a more direct path to the exit. A Proctor warns her that two died while crossing it last year, but Aloy is not deterred. The old path contains log bridges and a variety of zip lines. Aloy finds herself in first place while crossing the finish line and wins the Proving.
As a Proctor announces Aloy's victory, arrows rain from above and slay her along with a handful of other newly anointed Braves. A group of attackers in Carja clothing attack the remaining Nora. Aloy, Bast, and Vala dispatch them before more reinforcements arrive. However, a Cultist using a machine gun overwhelms Vala and Bast, killing them both. It is revealed that Aloy is one of the primary targets of the raid. While inspecting an enemy corpse, Aloy finds it to be wearing a Focus. Suddenly, she is grabbed from behind by an unmasked attacker. He tells her to turn her face to the sun before Rost appears firing arrows at him. After a struggle, Rost is stabbed by the unknown attacker but manages to crawl to an unconscious Aloy. He pushes her off the mountain to safety, while she witnesses an explosion that envelopes Rost.

Aloy wakes inside the sacred mountain, a place where only the Matriarchs are allowed inside. She searches for her equipment, finds it, and rearms herself. The mountain contains doors and other remnants of old technology found in the Metal World. She scans the damaged Focus recovered from the Cultists and discovers a video hologram of Rost's killer. The hologram tells the other cultists to avoid all contact with the Nora tribe but to kill every witness if they are seen. A map is shown and Aloy sees a video of herself while she was talking to Olin in Mother's Heart. Afterward, Aloy sees an unknown woman who bears a strong resemblance to her. The word ""Terminate"" is shown - proving that the Cultists were targeting Aloy.

Teersa comes across Aloy and tells her to follow her to the place where she was born. Aloy was not born from a human, but from the mountain itself. The pair enter the Great Chamber where the All-Mother resides. As a child, Aloy was found in front of a large metal door within the heart of the mountain. Teersa believed that Aloy was a gift from the All-Mother, while the other Matriarchs saw her as a curse. When Aloy steps up to the mountain's door, a red light shines, stating ""Halt for identification. Error: Alpha Registry Corrupted - Identity cannot be confirmed. Entry denied.""

Teersa says that if Aloy heals the corruption, the door could open. Aloy decides to seek answers by finding Olin and to visit Meridian looking for clues.

Aloy finds Resh, the newly appointed War-Chief, and asks him to open the gate to Mother's Watch. He initially refuses and voices his disapproval. Before she can leave, a horde of Striders attacks the settlement. Among them is a Corruptor, a powerful machine capable of taking control of docile machines and turning them hostile. After destroying the machines, Aloy examines the carcass of the Corruptor and removes its override component. She attaches the device to her spear.

With the new device that allowed her to override machines, Aloy successfully uses it to override a Strider, which she uses as a mount to travel faster. As she approaches the Main Embrace Gate, she hears the sounds of fighting outside. Varl, a Nora Brave, is ending a fight against a group of corrupted machines.

The Carja guards apologising for the wait to enter the city.
Aloy begins her journey to Meridian, the Carja capital to find Olin, the Oseram whom she met before the day of the Proving Massacre. As Aloy reaches the city, she finds that an angry crowd of Carja artisans have gathered outside the main bridge, halted by the Carja guards. Continuing past them Aloy is barred entry from the city with the guard informing her that in light of the recent murders of Ersa and her Vanguard, all travelers are subjected to search before entering into Meridian. After a brief argument with the guard Erend emerges, relieved to see she is alive. Once they are alone, Aloy relays what she knows about Olin and the Proving Massacre, demanding to be taken to him. Erend tells her that Olin is no longer in the city but agrees to let her search his apartment as long as he may accompany her.
Finding Olin[]
The hatch destroyed.
Entering the apartment, Aloy discovers a sealed hatch hidden beneath a rug. Without a key and unable to open it herself, Aloy continues searching for more clues and a way to open the hatch. Searching upstairs, Aloy finds a pallet stacked with ingots. As she pushes the pallet form the platform, it crashes through the hatch below, granting them access to the floor below. With her Focus, Aloy begins investigating the secret workshop, discovering a map on the wall and Olin's journal, confirming that the Oseram knew Aloy was being targeted. She then finds a datapoint addressed to Olin from the killers, learning that the killers captured his wife and child to coerce him into working for them. After Aloy fills Erend in on what she found then turns and tries to leave, although Erend blocks her way, asking for her help in finding those responsible for his sister's death. Telling her he'll wait for her at Red Ridge Pass, he lets Aloy go.
The Corruptors activated.
Aloy journeys to the Rockwreath, the excavation site where she hopes to find Olin. From a hidden vantage point, she watches as Corruptors are raised from the ground. Suddenly, Olin and the killers cry out, revealing their Focuses have stopped working. Realizing they are not alone, the cultist leader orders for a search of the area to find the intruders. Meanwhile an unknown caller taps into Aloy's Focus, informing her that he has temporarily disabled the killers' Focuses to assist her. Aloy descends into the site to kill the Corruptors and the cultists.
Olin's Fate[]
Olin answering Aloy's questions.
Once the enemies are dispatched and only Olin remains, Aloy approaches him to demand answers. She learns the killers are called ""the Eclipse"", a Shadow Carja cult. The Eclipse's master, a ""demon"" called HADES, is the one who put out the kill order on Aloy at the Proving. She learns that the man who tried to kill her is Helis, Sun-King Jiran's champion Kestrel and an Eclipse leader. Under the instruction of HADES, the Eclipse are excavating sites of the Old Ones to bring machines back to life and recruit them into their army. Although Olin doesn't know who the woman is that Aloy so closely resembles, he tells her that he saw an image of the woman in Maker's End, ruins of the Old Ones.
After Olin reveals all he knows, Aloy decides whether to spare his life or kill him to avenge the deaths of the Nora killed during the Proving Massacre. Regardless of Olin's fate, Aloy agrees to travel to the Spurflints to rescue his family, although her choice regarding Olin's life impacts the errand Collateral.
If Aloy kills Olin, she will find and rescue the hostages from the cultists by herself and relay a message to Olin's family.
If Olin remains alive, he will meet Aloy in the Spurflints and lead her to the Eclipse outpost. She can further decide whether or not to accept his steel for the fight. Either way, Olin will reunite with his family and they decide to return to the Claim.","Go to Meridian

Aloy seeing the Deathbringer.
HADES taking notice of Aloy.
After stocking up on a cache of supplies left by the unknown caller outside the ruins, she discovers a number of Corrupted machines guarding the site where the Eclipse have begun excavations. Following the sound of explosions to their source, Aloy is faced with a new war machine of the ancients, a Deathbringer. After killing the cultists and the machine, Aloy takes a Focus from the Eclipse officer. Through this, HADES learns that Aloy is still alive and consequently causes the Focus to self-destruct. Free to roam the ruins, Aloy squeezes through the crack to enter. Similar to All-Mother mountain, Aloy is examined by the Identiscan and permitted access to the Faro Automated Solutions (FAS) facility.
Through a number of datapoints, Aloy learns that FAS was a corporation that manufactured machines and technology such as the Focuses. They controlled these machines through codes. After some time, the corporation stopped making machines and began to make weapons. Another datapoint tells her that for some reason the people were angry with FAS. Continuing on to a room with holographic recordings, Aloy learns that the Deathbringer, Corruptor and Metal Devil were all creations of FAS as robots of war. Climbing up an elevator shaft and scaling the various levels, Aloy finally reaches Ted Faro's office on the 35th floor.
Ted and Elisabet discussing the threat to life on Earth.
Consulting the remaining technology of the Old Ones, a number of data files are retrieved and Aloy finally learns the identity of the mysterious woman, Elisabet Sobeck, and the beginning of the downfall of her civilization. Ted Faro, founder and head of FAS, invited Elisabet Sobeck to provide a solution for a glitch in the Faro robots. With the capacity to self-replicate and create their own fuel through biomass conversion, the machines had begun the extinction of all life on Earth at a rate faster than the humans could contain. Another data file reveals that Elisabet Sobeck managed to forge a solution; Project Zero Dawn, to which Ted Faro reluctantly agreed.
Aloy and Sylens discussing the situation.
Despite all the new information, Aloy is no closer to understanding her connection to Elisabet Sobeck nor why the Eclipse specifically targeted her at the Proving. The unknown caller appears before Aloy as a hologram, explaining to Aloy that he has spent the last few decades searching the ruins of the Old Ones to discover what happened to them. Threatening to remove her Focus and render him blind after he berates her for asking trivial questions, he finally introduces himself as Sylens. He informs her that HADES is the head of the Eclipse and that it is through his instruction that the cultists are digging up the ancient machines. He also explains the reason he can tap into her Focus is through years of experimentation, likening it to her overriding of machines.
Remembering that Elisabet Sobeck mentioned she was heading to a place called the U.S. Robot Command, Sylens tells her it is now a ruin called the Grave-Hoard in the eastern mountains. Determined to find out more about Project: Zero Dawn and Elisabet Sobeck, Aloy heads for the Grave-Hoard.","Go to Maker's End and search for clues to the unknown woman's identity. Who was she?

As Aloy nears the ruins, she sees a number of Eclipse agents and Corrupted machines. Killing them and descending into the bunker, the first room reveals that it was a site where the Old Ones faced off against hordes of Faro robots. Logs from the soldiers preserved as datapoints detail a number of battles that the Old Ones fought against the robots as well as the increasing hopelessness of the situation. Restoring power to a bunker door, Aloy continues deeper into the ruins. After taking out a room of machines and cultists, Aloy finds a room that shows her a map of the Earth, demonstrating the progression of the robots. Making her way outside, she finds the cultists tinkering with the skeleton of a Metal Devil, causing a Deathbringer to be released from the machine and brought to life.
Upon defeating the enemies, Aloy enters another room to find that Project Zero Dawn was successfully completed but only through the aid of a simultaneous war plan, Operation: Enduring Victory, which bought time for Zero Dawn to be finalized.
Upon climbing back to the surface via an elevator shaft, Aloy concludes that she needs to find the Orbital Launch Base that the Old Ones mentioned in the datapoint. Sylens informs her that it lies in ruins beneath the Citadel, the palace at the Shadow Carja capital, Sunfall. Understanding that it will be too dangerous to enter the city as any Eclipse agents wearing Focuses will be able to identify her, Aloy suggests crashing the network to disable their communications with each other and HADES.

https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/To_Curse_the_Darkness,Main_quests,"Still no closer to understanding what Project Zero Dawn is after exploring the ruins of the U.S.R.C., Sylens informs Aloy that their next stop lies buried beneath Sunfall, the Shadow Carja capital. Knowing that Aloy will not be able to approach the capital safely while Eclipse agents equipped with Focuses roam the city, Sylens formulates a plan to take down the Eclipse's Focus network. He instructs Aloy to meet him at the location marked on her Focus, at the falls southeast of Brightmarket.
Closing in on the location, Sylens informs Aloy that upon close inspection of the rock wall, she will find handholds that will take her up. Scaling the wall, Aloy comes to a campsite in an a small alcove where she rests until nightfall to await further instruction. When nightfall comes, Sylens reveals that he has brought Aloy to the Eclipse's main base where she will be able to disable the Focus network. He explains that her target is a derelict Tallneck that the Eclipse have modified to function as a kind of router for their network. Thus she is to infiltrate the base and destroy the transmitter atop the Tallneck's head. Upon her questioning, Sylens admits that he used to assist the Eclipse but departs before Aloy can inquire any further.
Squeezing through the crevice, Aloy emerges into a clearing patrolled by a number of corrupted machines, at the back of the base. Sneaking past the machines, Aloy makes her way to a ledge overlooking the camp where a number of cultists are prowling. Despite Sylens' intel, Aloy only comes across the legs of the Tallneck. Concluding it must have been moved, Sylens then instructs her to check the ravine to the left. Either by sneaking past or killing the cultists, Aloy comes across a tent; after listening to the numerous datapoints scattered around the tent and examining the ceremonial armor on display, she realizes that it belongs to Helis.
Moving on, Aloy fells a dead tree to cross the ravine where she finds the Tallneck, surrounded by a series of wooden platforms, although deserted. Climbing to the top, Aloy sees the skeleton a Metal Devil which she deduces must be HADES. As she tries to pry the casing off the module atop the Tallneck's head, she is shocked and thrown back, with HADES using the wire connecting the machines to approach Aloy. While knowing she cannot destroy HADES then, she drives her spear through the module, successfully crashing the Focus network. At this, HADES orders Aloy to be killed, with a Deathbringer shooting down the Tallneck. Now under heavy fire,  Aloy flees, heading for the rappel point by the bridge. As she throws herself over the edge, the bridge is blown up, severing Aloy's tie to the rappel point and sending her plummeting into the river below. Injured although not pursued, Aloy climbs to the riverbank where Sylens appears once again. Angered that he led her to HADES but knowing that she needs her Focus, she makes her way to the Shadow Carja capital to find the answers that both she and Sylens seek.","Hunt down the Proving killers (if Revenge of the Nora has not been completed)

https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Deep_Secrets_of_the_Earth,Main_quests,"After successfully infiltrating the Eclipse base and taking down their Focus network, Aloy makes her way to Sunfall, the Shadow Carja capital. There she hopes to find more answers about Elisabet Sobeck and Project Zero Dawn.
Entering the city, Aloy looks down from a balcony into the Sun-Ring where a number of Shadow Carja soldiers are attempting to handle a Behemoth. Sylens welcomes Aloy to the Citadel. In the courtyard, Aloy is ushered into the throne room along with a crowd of mercenaries who have gathered to hear High Priest Bahavas announce the day's bounties. As Bahavas announces a bounty on a man named Uthid, a woman approaches Aloy in the crowd, telling her that she wishes to meet with her in Shadowside. As the woman takes her leave, Sylens informs Aloy that the entrance into the Old Ones facility is behind her.
Scaling the rock formations, Aloy finds a covered vent on the other side of a tower. Entering through the vent and descending deeper into the earth, Aloy comes to the door of the facility. While her genetic identity is confirmed and access is authorized, there is a malfunction that bars the doors from opening. She authorizes an emergency venting procedure and the doors open, but a loud mechanical noise alerts the Shadow Carja Kestrels to something amiss in the ruin.
With little time to explore, Aloy begins exploring the Project: Zero Dawn facility. She enters a holographic theater and a message from General Herres of the Old Ones' U.S. Robot Command explains the true purpose of Operation: Enduring Victory. He reveals that Zero Dawn was not a top-secret superweapon program that would save humanity, as it was purported to be. In reality, the Faro Plague had become too advanced for it to be stopped, and the extinction of all life on Earth was inevitable. Operation: Enduring Victory was implemented purely to buy time for Elisabet Sobeck and her team to finish Project: Zero Dawn.
Continuing on to the next room, Aloy discovers that some Kestrels have entered the facility. After killing them and scanning the datapoints, Aloy continues on to find another theater with a hologram message left by Elisabet Sobeck who finally explains what Project: Zero Dawn is: a terraforming system controlled by an artificial intelligence unit called GAIA. Through GAIA and her sub-functions, the artificial intelligence would shut down the Faro Plague and eventually reform the earth to re-create humanity. Aloy takes out more Kestrels and restores power to an ancient door to reach Central Projects.
Central Projects[]
After killing the waves of cultists that descend into the room, she heads for the second floor. As she passes through the vast rooms she is introduced to a few sub-functions of GAIA, learning their functions through holographic messages left by the Old Ones. She eventually comes to a room where Travis Tate explains the purpose of HADES; a failsafe system that would seize control of the terraforming system in the event that GAIA produced a world that was unsustainable or uninhabitable, deconstructing the world so that GAIA may try again. After learning about ELEUTHIA from a hologram of Patrick Brochard-Klein, Aloy deduces that All-Mother mountain must be one of the Cradles created to produce humans.
Dr. Sobeck's office and the Alpha Registry
Climbing up the elevator shaft, Aloy comes to a room with a number of datapoints containing interactions between Elisabet and an early GAIA as well as Ted Faro. Prying open the door to Sobeck's office, Aloy finds and copies the Alpha Registry master file that will allow her access to the facility in All-Mother mountain. As Aloy and Sylens argue about her origins, more Kestrels descend outside the office, including Helis who throws a blast bomb. The explosion stuns Aloy, allowing Helis to approach her and knock her unconscious.
Some time later, Aloy awakens to find herself unarmed and unarmored, suspended in a cage above the Sun-Ring. Helis approaches, telling her that before she crashed the Eclipse network, he sent an order out to rally the Eclipse to invade the Sacred Lands. He then destroys her Focus. Now addressing the crowd, two Corruptors enter the Sun-Ring and begin corrupting a restrained Behemoth. Condemning Aloy to be the first of thousands to die, she is dropped into the Sun-Ring to face off against the machine.","Go to Sunfall

Aloy being dropped into the Sun-Ring.
After a brief talk with Helis, Aloy, Unarmed and unarmored, is dropped into the Sun-Ring at the Shadow Carja capital of Sunfall to face off against a Corrupted Behemoth. Noting the machine's considerable strength, she realizes that she can use it to her advantage, luring the machine close enough to the pillars so that when it charges to attack, if she can move out of the way the force of the machine will weaken the pillars supporting the platform. After weakening two of the pillars, the platform crashes to the ground with Aloy running into the dust cloud. When she emerges, she is fully armored and prepared to defeat the machine.

Much to the disbelief of Helis and the crowd, Aloy manages to take down the machine, challenging the Kestrel to face her himself. Helis then orders the two Corruptors into the Ring to finish her off. Before either Aloy or the Corruptors have the chance to strike, there is an explosion at the main gate of the Sun-Ring and two overridden Striders enter, with Sylens atop one of them. Aloy hops onto the back of the other Strider and together they ride towards the open gates of the Sun-Ring with the Corruptors in pursuit. Drawn to the Sun-Ring by the machine lure Sylens embeds in the dirt, three overridden Ravagers emerge and engage the Corruptors, allowing Sylens and Aloy to escape the Sun-Ring.

Once they've traveled a safe distance from Sunfall, they slow to a stop. Sylens supplies Aloy with a new Focus downloaded with all the files from her destroyed Focus including the Alpha Registry she needs to access the ruins in All-Mother Mountain. After demanding some explanations from Sylens, he refuses Aloy's request for assistance in stopping the Eclipse threat from destroying the Sacred Lands. Leaving Aloy with a set of armor that will conceal her identity should she need to return to Shadow Carja territory and an apology, they part ways.

Fast travel into the Embrace is not possible, with the campfire outside of the Main Embrace Gate being the closest campfire that can be fast travelled to. Outside of the gate, Aloy learns Marea's fate and speaks to a fatally wounded Brave who explains that the remaining tribespeople have retreated into All-Mother Mountain.
As she makes her way through the haze that has settled over the Embrace, she is greeted with a trail of destruction. Small groups of cultists, Corruptors, Deathbringers, and Corrupted machines roam the area. Combat can be avoided by using stealth.
There are a number of optional locations Aloy can visit at this point before making her way to Mother's Watch. Visiting Mother's Cradle and defeating the cultist presence allows Aloy to free three Braves who have been taken captive, finding Karst dead outside his house, and Grata's camp empty with Grata nowhere in sight. They will then follow Aloy until she gets inside All-Mother mountain, assisting in combat along the way. At Mother's Heart, Aloy finds the settlement abandoned and another wounded Brave lies on the ground outside pointing Aloy to All-Mother Mountain. Aloy can also visit Karst's House and Grata's Camp to investigate their fates, and stop by Rost's Grave to reflect before heading to Mother's Watch.
Finally arriving at Mother's Watch, Aloy battles her way through the Eclipse and Corrupted machines to All-Mother Mountain, only to find a Corrupted Thunderjaw attacking it. Realizing that the Nora seeking shelter inside the mountain are at risk of being trapped inside, Aloy quickly comes to their defense. Encouraged by Aloy's presence, Sona and her Braves, including Varl, emerge from the mountain to provide aid. Once the machines and cultists have been killed, Varl fills Aloy in on the events that led up to their withdrawal to the mountain. Aloy then makes her way inside to talk to the High Matriarchs.
All-Mother Mountain[]
On her way through, Aloy reunites with many of the Nora she encountered on her travels, including a wounded Teb. Aloy is welcomed by Teersa and Jezza, however Lansra still remains hostile towards her, disapproving of her intentions to delve into the mountain. Despite Lansra's objections, Aloy uses the Alpha Registry to override the bunker door and gain entry to what she learns is ELEUTHIA Cradle-9, the facility where she was created. Through listening to the series of datapoints scattered throughout the facility, Aloy learns that humans were created here in artificial wombs, raised to adulthood by robotic figures called multiservitors.
Aloy comes to a door that has been considerably graffitied by the past humans that inhabited the cradle but were denied further access. Granted access, Aloy descends into the room beyond, the Lyceum, an area designated for learning through APOLLO and the Faro Focuses. Attempting to listen to the datapoints, Aloy learns that APOLLO is offline. Climbing the stairs to another room, Aloy is instructed to scan a datapoint with her Focus, the last message and dying plea of GAIA. In the message GAIA explains that a data transmission corrupted the GAIA Prime facility, transforming the subordinate functions into chaotic independent entities and awakening HADES. Realizing that once HADES takes control of the terraforming system the extinction of all life on Earth will ensue, GAIA ordered for her Prime reactor to overload and self-destruct in a blast that would stop HADES but also destroy GAIA. Understanding that despite HADES destruction the Earth would still be at peril, GAIA announced that she has ordered the gestation of one last embryo, made from the DNA of Elisabet Sobeck so that they may be granted access to the facilities in order to restore GAIA once again. GAIA then instructs that the Master Override be obtained from GAIA Prime to be used against HADES.
With the termination of the message, Aloy struggles to come to terms with the fact that she was created by GAIA as an instrument. After Sylens tells her he will meet her in the ruins of GAIA Prime, Aloy exits the facility, greeted by the awed Nora who begin to worship and praise her. Angered by their sudden reverence, Aloy argues that the outcome of the task she has been set isn't exclusive to the Nora, rather it affects everyone outside its borders. Announcing that any willing to fight should meet her in Meridian, she departs for the Bitter Climb.","Go to All-Mother; the sacred mountain of the Nora tribe holds the secrets of your birth.

Scaling the Bitter Climb, Aloy encounters a number of hostile machines protecting the way, including a Stormbird close to the summit. Defeating the machine, Aloy continues to find the aftermath of GAIA's sacrifice; a hole blown through the mountain leaving the facility in ruins. Following the route Sylens prepared for her, Aloy meets with his hologram in his workshop above the ruins.
After he briefly explains how he came to find the ruins, Aloy voices her skepticism about repairing GAIA after witnessing the extensive damage. Sylens directs her attention to the present task: stopping HADES.
GAIA Prime[]
Aloy gaining access to the rest of the facility.
The Elisabet Sobeck Memorial.
Gaining access to the rest of the facility, Aloy finds herself in Elisabet's room where she discovers a number of her journals. As they are severely damaged and corrupted, rendering them unreadable in their current state, Aloy scans them so that her Focus can recover the files. Continuing on, Aloy comes to a room where a holographic shrine to Elisabet has been set up. A file left from Charles Ronson explains that six hours after GAIA was deployed one of the access seals malfunctioned, leaving a gap of ten millimeters instead of the standard two millimeters. This malfunction allowed an energy signature to pass through, alerting the robot swarm of the facility's location. The only solution was to seal the hatch from the outside. While the Alphas argued amongst themselves who should go, Elisabet sacrificed herself to close the hatch. Knowing that it was too late to try and re-enter the facility, Elisabet departed for her home. This realization causes Aloy to both mourn Elisabet and marvel at her drive and conscientiousness.
The recording to Ted purging APOLLO and murdering the Alphas.
Continuing to climb the facility, Aloy spots a section of the facility that appears to be intact despite the blast. Sylens informs her that this is the control room. Arriving at the control room, Aloy unlocks the hatch to reveal the bodies of the Alphas gathered around a conference desk. Noting that air rushed in instead of out the moment the hatch opened, Aloy begins the hologram. It begins with the Alphas unable to access the core control. Ted Faro's hologram then appears before them. He discloses his concern about gifting the future humans with their knowledge. Believing that this will only result in history repeating itself, Ted Faro reveals that he purged APOLLO and subsequently activates the ventilation of the control room, suffocating and killing the Alphas. After an interaction with Sylens, Aloy retrieves the Master Override from the desk.
Sylens' Past[]
Sylens explaining his role with the Eclipse.
Aloy returns to the workshop to find Sylens waiting for her, telling her that their journey together has come to an end. Knowing that she is deserving of an explanation, he goes on to explain that he was the one that discovered and revived HADES. Recognizing that HADES was a source of vast amounts of knowledge, Sylens agreed to carry out its wishes by forming the Eclipse cult. He mentions that HADES wasn't interested in Meridian but rather the Spire. Recalling that it was MINERVA, GAIA's code-breaking module responsible for transmitting the codes that would deactivate Faro's robots and shut down their biomatter conversion systems, Aloy realizes that HADES means to use the Spire to reawaken the Faro machines so they can destroy the world once again.

With further prompting, Sylens describes more about how he discovered HADES and subsequently formed the Eclipse in exchange for knowledge. Sylens then leaves his lance and workshop to Aloy before finally departing.

Now in the possession of a weapon that will allow her to defeat HADES, Aloy journeys back to the Palace of the Sun in Meridian to warn Sun-King Avad of the coming threat to their existence.","Go to the Bitter Climb

While the defenses are organized, Aloy and Avad discuss the enemy. Afterwards, Blameless Marad informs her that allies have arrived from all over the Sundom, including a small force that has come for Aloy personally, bolstering the defenses at the ridge and the Spire.

Varl

Always Present

Varl admits he is having difficulty trying to fathom the task at hand, but is nonetheless grateful for all Aloy has done. He says that although it is by All-Mother's will that they fight, he would have come regardless for Aloy.

Meeting with Sun-King Avad at the Palace of the Sun, they watch as a massive explosion atop the mesa close to Evening's Sign causes a landslide, providing a shortcut for the war machines to march on the Spire. Avad commands the Oseram Vanguard to take up the guns in preparation for the Deathbringers. As the Carja guards move to their stations, there is an explosion from below the balcony, with Helis and a number of Eclipse cultists emerging. Prepared to take him on himself, Avad moves to face him but Aloy stops him, ordering him to rally the Vanguard and send reinforcements. Despite Avad's protests, Aloy leaves to confront the Kestrel.
Taking out the cultists, Aloy then faces Helis one-on-one. Bringing him down to his knees, Aloy chooses her final words for the Terror of the Sun before finishing him off. Aloy then takes a zipline down to the ridge to provide aid against the onslaught of Deathbringers and Corrupted machines.
Using the Oseram Cannons, they face wave after wave of machines from both the west and south. However, more Deathbringers continue to advance on them, with one firing at the ridge and bringing it down on top of Aloy. Aloy manages to stay conscious long enough to see a Deathbringer hauling HADES behind it, marching past her and towards the Spire.
Some time later she is awoken by Teb, who is relieved to find her alive among the rubble. He tells her that the machines marched through and continued to the Spire with the others remaining to fight off the Corrupted machines ransacking Meridian Village. Leaving Teb to take care of the others, Aloy makes her way through the burning destruction to the Spire. As she reaches the bottom of the mesa, she sees that HADES has already begun sending the transmission that will awaken the dormant Faro machines across the world. Realizing that means HADES must have gotten through the defenses, she continues on. With both parties relieved to see the other alive, Aloy announces she is going to face HADES, with Varl, Erend and Talanah (Sona if Hunter's Lodge sidequests are not complete) agreeing to back her up. Together they go over the top.
Upon arriving, HADES is unfazed by Aloy's presence, continuing to send the transmission as it awakens a Deathbringer to deal with her. Knowing that they are running out of time to stop HADES, Aloy works together with Varl, Erend and Talanah to take out the Deathbringer and the subsequent waves of Corrupted machines that follow. Once the machines have been defeated, Aloy approaches HADES, driving Sylens' Lance through its lens. Activating the Master Override with Elisabet Sobeck's credentials, the extinction protocol is purged, stopping the transmission and finishing off HADES.
After a brief celebration of their victory, Aloy journeys alone to find Elisabet Sobeck. Arriving at the ruins of Sobeck Ranch, Aloy discovers Elisabet's body among a triangle of flowers much like those found around the Metal Flowers. In Elisabet's hand is a globe locket, which Aloy takes and cherishes.
Meanwhile, back at the Spire some Carja villagers are inspecting HADES' remains, only to witness the departure of the AI from the metal sphere. From there it travels until it finds Sylens, who captures it in a lantern-like device.

Agreeing to get the spear back herself, she sends Arana back to her father. Using her Focus, Aloy follows Arana's steps to just outside of Mother's Cradle. From there Aloy picks up the trail of the Scrapper, following it across a river to a herd of other Scrappers and Watchers near the Southern Embrace Gate.
Aloy recovers Arana's spear from the marked Scrapper and comments on the strong crafting ability of its maker. She returns to Arana and Thok to receive their gratitude. As a reward, Thok upgrades Aloy's spear.","Find Arana

https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forgotten,Side_quests,"Olara's troubled brother, Brom, has gone missing. Brom was exiled from the Nora tribe for ten years and lived in a camp outside of the major settlements. When his sentence was over, he did not return. Olara petitioned the Matriarchs to send Braves looking for him, but they found only his abandoned, blood-soaked camp.
Aloy comes across Olara calling out to Brom from a ledge in the southern part of the Embrace and offers to help. She heads to his camp and finds it overrun with Watchers. By scanning the site with her Focus, Aloy tracks a trail of blood to a bucket with footprints. Sensing that something strange is going on, she tracks the footprints to a group of Scrappers.
After dispatching them, Aloy stumbles upon the carcass of a Watcher with a spear in it. More clues reveal themselves when she finds a stolen supply crate and then finds the supplies abandoned. At the end of the trail is Brom himself. He talks to himself and appears to be in distress, threatening suicide while teetering on a cliff. Aloy talks him away from the ledge and Olara appears not soon after. Brom's mental illness seems to prevent him from returning to the Nora, but Olara is just happy to see him and knows she can take care of him outside of the tribe. Depending on the player's dialogue choices, Olara will either keep watch over Brom or send him back to the wilderness on his own.","Go to Brom's Camp

https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Armory,Side_quests,"Tucked into the Sacred Lands of the Nora is a long-forgotten bunker of the Old Ones that contains a curious set of armor sealed away behind locked Ancient Doors. To gain access, Aloy must collect five Power Cells located throughout the world.
Obtaining the quest[]
This quest will be activated either the first time Aloy comes across one of the Power Cells during the main quest or when she visits the Bunker, depending on which happens first.
If Aloy visits the rock formation east of Mother's Rise before finding a Power Cell, the quest will be triggered after using handholds to climb down into an underground lake following the path into the underground bunker.
If Aloy doesn't visit the bunker, the quest will start automatically when she picks up one of the Power Cells required to open the locked Ancient Doors. Four of the Power Cells can easily be obtained during the main quest, but the fifth requires Aloy to revisit the ruins she fell into and found her Focus in as a child. The first Power Cell can be obtained during The Womb of the Mountain.
Power Cells[]
First Cell[]
One Power Cell is found in the underground facility that Aloy fell into as a child. This location can be revisited at any time during the game. Return to the ruins near Mother's Watch and make your way through them. Eventually you will come to a locked door that must be pried open with your spear. Beyond that there will be another doorway which is blocked by stalactites. Simply smash these with your spear and you will find the Power Cell on a table at the back of the room.
Second Cell[]
The second Power Cell is in All-Mother Mountain. After the Proving quest, you will end up here at the beginning of the main quest, The Womb of the Mountain. Instead of following Teersa to the left, go straight out of the room where you get your equipment back until you find a locked red door. Look to the left, crawl down a tunnel lit with candles, and you will find the Cell in the room at the end. If this Cell is not obtained during the Womb of the Mountain quest, it will not be accessible again until the main quest, The Heart of the Nora. The gate to Mother's Watch will be closed and All-Mother cannot be entered until then. Note that the fifth and final cell cannot be obtained until the quest after The Heart of the Nora in any case, so this makes little difference overall.
Third Cell[]
The third cell is in the Maker's End ruin, which you will visit as part of the Maker's End main quest. Climb all the way to the very top of the ruins to Ted Faro's office. Once there, instead of following the quest objective and examining the data storage system, turn around and find the yellow handholds leading up the ruined sky scraper. Follow these all the way to the top and find the Power Cell there. Use the rappel point to return to Ted Faro's office and continue the quest.
Fourth Cell[]
The fourth cell is in the Grave-Hoard, where you will go to as part of the Grave-Hoard main storyline quest. Once you have restored power to the Ancient Door and gone through it, look around until you spot a telltale green diamond, indicating the hidden Power Cell. You will need to pass this cell in order to get to the next part of the facility, so it is perhaps the most difficult one to miss.
Fifth Cell[]
The final Power Cell requires the quest The Mountain That Fell. Go to GAIA Prime. Instead of rappelling down, go to the left of the rappel point and carefully move to the edge of the cliff. There are hidden handholds leading up to a hidden-in-plain-sight area where you will find a purple-lit hallway. The Power Cell sits on a shelf to the right at the very back.
Opening the locks[]
Take your five Power Cells back and slide two into the vacant slots. Now you have to solve a puzzle where you have to rotate each of the five holograms into a certain position. A display to the right will show five 24-hour codes in military time. Imagine each hologram as a clock and turn them to their respective position. The first door is open, and on the right of the new room, you will find five more holographic locks. Use the last three Power Cells, and this time, a panel on the left will show angle measurements (90 degrees, 270 degrees, etc). Again, just turn the locks to these positions (from left to right) right, left, up, right, left. Now the final barrier is down and you can just walk in and claim it.","Find a Use for the Power Cell

Aloy can receive this quest from one of two Nora healers: Enara in Mother's Heart and Fia in Mother's Rise.
In Mother's Rise, Aloy can speak to Fia who is tending to a Brave that was fatally wounded in the nearby ambush following the Proving Massacre. She explains that the rest of the wounded were carried to Mother's Heart, but due to the severity of this hunter's injuries he was left behind. Fia has been asked to remain with him in his final moments. Fia will ask Aloy to find Dreamwillow to help ease the man into death.
If Aloy visits Mother's Heart before speaking to Fia, she will encounter Fia's aunt, Enara, tending to the wounded on a porch in Mother's Heart. Overworked and exasperated, Enara initially snaps at Aloy before apologizing and accepting her offer for help. Enara will suggest that Aloy look for Dreamwillow along the Brave trails and asks her to bring whatever she finds to Fia.
Getting the Dreamwillow[]
Aloy navigates two Brave trails in the Embrace to loot their caches but finds that both have been emptied of the medicinal plant and filled with a few metal shards.
If Aloy received the quest from Fia, she will return and tell her the Dreamwillow has been taken.
If Aloy received the quest from Enara, she will next visit Fia in Mother's Rise. Fia will have the same dialogue that she does when giving Aloy the quest. However, instead of her asking Aloy to search for Dreamwillow, Aloy tells Fia that she searched the trails for Enara and came up empty.
Fia will then suggest Aloy pay a visit to Jun, a reclusive member of the tribe who lives in a secluded lodge on the edge of the Embrace. Jun is an alchemist that picks herbs and brews medicines. Fia tells Aloy to be careful because she may encounter more dangerous machines in the area.
As Aloy approaches his lodge she hears muffled cries coming from inside; Jun is crying out for help. After prying open Jun's door with her spear, she learns that a gang of outcasts stormed Jun's cabin, taking his Dreamwillow.
Using her Focus, Aloy follows the trail of the outcasts up the mountain, where she finds the band under attack by machines. After taking out the machines, Kurnst, the leader of the outcasts jumps down to thank her. He explains that they only took the Dreamwillow because they had wounded that were in need of it. After negotiations, he agrees to part with a small amount for Aloy to take back to Jun.
Aloy returns to Jun and gives him the Dreamwillow, instructing him to deliver it to Fia. Jun inquires about the fate of the outcast gang, using language that makes his disgust for outcasts clear. Aloy informs him of her own status as an outcast and an argument occurs. The player is presented with a flashpoint and regardless of choice, Aloy leaves with a warning: she will be back if the Dreamwillow is not delivered to Fia.","Search Brave Trails for Dreamwillow Caches

This quest is given by Lubavad, the operator of a trading caravan company. He is encountered during Aloy's first trip to Hunter's Gathering. After failing to recruit the Banuk hunter Opitak to deliver ammunition to one of his caravans that was accidentally left behind before they left on an expedition to trade with the Banuk, he accepts Aloy's offer to help.
Lubavad explains that the route is frequented by Longlegs and Scrappers, as well as a dangerous new machine; out of concern for his employees, Lubavad prepared a crate of Explosive Arrows to help them defend the caravan. However, they failed to take the ammunition with them. Worried for the safety of his employees and knowing it is too dangerous to continue himself, Lubavad hands over the ammunition to Aloy to be delivered.
Alternatively, this quest can be obtained from the caravan boss himself, Marzavid. If Aloy encounters his caravan on the road east of Hunter's Gathering before speaking to Lubavad, Marzavid will call out to her for help and give her the quest. He will explain that his group is struggling to stave off the machines.
Reaching the traders[]
When Aloy arrives at the caravan, the trader Marzavid explains that the crate that was supposed to be holding the ammunition for their weapons was instead packed with Ridge-Wood. Just then, a wave of machines attacks the group. After defeating the machines, an inspection of the cargo reveals that the Songcores are missing. Marzavid immediately deduces that Dirid, a trader who had fled after the first wave of machine attacks, must have taken off with them. Agreeing to find Dirid, Aloy sets off to return the stolen goods.
Using her Focus to track down Dirid, Aloy confronts the thief, who at first claims to have no knowledge of the caravan. As he begins to explain himself, he is shot down by the dangerous new machine Lubavad warned Aloy about; a Stalker. After defeating the Stalker, Aloy returns to the dying and remorseful Dirid.

https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/A_Moment%27s_Peace,Side_quests,"While in Meridian, Aloy meets Vilgund, who tells her of a remote Banuk camp in the northern region, near the Anvil of the Moon, where machines are entirely docile. Vilgund sent two of his men to the camp to find out exactly what might be happening but has not heard back from them. He tells Aloy that he will pay her to relay information about the camp to him, as well as discover where his men are.
Upon entering the camp, Aloy confirms that the rumors are indeed true, with Banuk shamans living peacefully amongst machines, even Thunderjaws.
Aloy meets Tikuk, a shaman who tells her of a 'blue light', or the machine's spirit, that is strong in the area. When traveling through a storm, the Banuk heard the 'song' of the Thunderjaw and camped across the area. The Banuk people believe that each machine has a song, and that they were all docile before something turned them against humanity.
Aloy picks up a strange signal through her Focus that leads her to the top of a cliff overlooking the camp. There, she finds two Oseram, Menuf and Bajund, who plead with her to stop the others in their group, Garnund and Dorgeld, from messing with a suspicious device. Aloy discovers these are the men that Vilgund sent. The Oseram group is desperate to use this device for profit, but Aloy tells them they are in over their heads and makes them leave. Not long after, however, chaos can be heard in the camp below. The device was responsible for emitting a signal that calmed the machines, and the signal finally faded. The machines begin to attack the Banuk.
Aloy assists the rest of the camp in dispatching the now-deranged machines. The Banuk shamans thank her and express their hope that some day they can understand the machines' blue light.","Search for the Banuk Camp

https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/A_Daughter%27s_Vengeance,Side_quests,"While at Mother's Rise, Aloy encounters a young Nora man named Yan making supplication to All-Mother. Yan tells Aloy that his prayers are for All-Mother to watch over his sister Nakoa, who had left to find and exact vengeance upon Zaid, a brutal Carja captain who had murdered and mutilated their father before her eyes during the Red Raids. She was determined to find him, even if it meant leaving the Sacred Lands, though she knew that to do so meant exile. Aloy offers to find her.
After acquiring additional information about Nakoa and Zaid from the siblings' aunt Solai in Mother's Crown, Aloy heads to the Carja/Nora border, arriving at the Carja outpost Daytower. There she finds Zaid, who has been assigned to the outpost as a prefect, and learns that Nakoa had confronted attacked him there some time prior. When Aloy asks him about it and about his involvement in the Red Raids, he stoutly claims innocence and mistaken identity. As for Nakoa, he tells Aloy that he had her released instead of detained, as he did not hold her misguided attack against her.
These are both lies. After the end of the Red Raids, personnel who had been involved in these and other atrocities has been purged from the Carja military, including the men of Zaid's former unit. Zaid however, had covered his involvement and thus kept his position. He and his former men then started a slave ring. He would direct vulnerable members of other tribes, such as those traveling alone, to abandoned Carja outposts staffed by his slavers, who would abduct them and sell them at slave auctions. Nakoa had in fact been his latest victim. After she had left Daytower when he released her, he had his slavers seize and take her to an abandoned outpost where the victims were kept.
Seeing Aloy as another victim, he suggests that she enquire about Nakoa at a Carja outpost named Lonesome Rock, where he had heard that a young woman had been abducted by bandits. In truth, Lonesome Rock is one of the abandoned outposts that his ring use in abducting victims, and the men there are part of his slave ring. They will, he expects, seize Aloy when she arrives.
Aloy goes to Lonesome Rock. Firiv and his men attempt to seize her when they see her investigating a cart that was used to transport Nakoa to the abandoned outpost where the victims are kept, but Aloy kills them. Using her Focus to follow the trail made by the cart, she arrives at the compound, kills the slavers and finds and frees Nakoa and two other victims. However, just as they are freed, Zaid arrives with more men, intent on recapturing them and seizing Aloy. Aloy engages them, kills the men and incapacitates Zaid. Nakoa kills Zaid With a spear from one of his fallen men.

After the Guardsman leaves, Aloy approaches Ranaman. Upon hearing about the situation from him, she offers to go to the estate, kill the machines and investigate the reason for the attacks. Ranaman appears grateful.
Aloy goes to the estate. After killing a prowling Ravager and Watchers, she discovers a lure which emits a signal that is attracting the machines, planted in the warehouse. After destroying it, she hears the cries of a young woman locked in a downstairs room in the house. The woman turns out to be Ranaman's sister, Daradi. Her father locked her in the room to protect her from the attacking machine, before he was killed by them. She informs Aloy that, far from being a concerned, caring son and brother, Ranaman is actually a greedy, murderous criminal whom their father disowned for his wickedness. Aloy realizes that it is he who planted the lure, to kill everyone on the estate in order to claim it as the sole heir.
Ranaman appears with another lure and admits to it all, smugly promising death to the two women when the machines drawn by this new lure arrive. However, his own wickedness destroys him when one of a flock of Glinthawks attracted by the lure seizes him, carries him off, and kills him. In the process, the lure is destroyed. Daradi again takes refuge in the house while Aloy successfully engages and kills the Glinthawks. Daradi thanks Aloy and gives her a Remarkable Reward Box in gratitude. Aloy leaves the estate.
Alternate ending[]
This quest can be completed without performing many of the objectives. After defeating the machines found at the estate, Aloy can return immediately to Ranaman without investigating the area, ending the quest. Completing the quest in this manner leads to the presumed death of Daradi, and Ranaman succeeding in his deception. This could be considered an easter egg, as the player is given no indication that returning to Ranaman at this stage of the quest is an option.

Upon arriving, Aloy meets the amicable Oseram inventor Petra Forgewoman, the leader of the settlement. A group of bandits has come between the Oseram and some valuable power cells in their foundry, and are trying to drive the Oseram off the claim. Furthermore, a pack of Scrappers have driven the Oseram away from some special weapon parts. Petra tasks Aloy with retrieving the needed goods so she can finish a powerful prototype weapon.
Aloy heads to the east of the settlement until she comes across the Oseram foundry, which is crawling with bandits. Aloy takes out all the bandits between her and the cells. There are high rock ledges and platforms all around the area that she can use to quietly snipe all the guards without raising the alarm. One is on a crate, another is at the top of a tower, and the last is in a junk heap.
Before Aloy leaves the foundry, she spots a bandit up above, who angrily yells down at her that the clan is on its way to burn Free Heap to the ground and will then come from her. He then retreats down a zip line. Aloy must head to the north to a junkyard crawling with Scrappers. Aloy searches through some scrap heaps to find the weapons parts, either killing or avoiding the few Scrappers that get in her way.
Returning to Free Heap, Aloy gives Petra the parts and warns her that a full attack is coming. Petra coolly welcomes them to try, and finishes her ""dispute settler:"" an extremely powerful weapon called the Oseram Cannon. Aloy then uses this deadly prototype to take out the entire clan of bandits.
Aloy returns the cannon to Petra, who is satisfied with the weapon's potential (although she admits it has room for improvement) and even more so with Aloy's help, telling her that she is in her debt.

Aloy notices that the shaman has been wounded, apparently by a Sawtooth. He explains that he was attempting to drink the machine’s blood when he was attacked. He asks Aloy to bring him blood from a Sawtooth and offers to share his vision with her in return.
Brin suggests that she hunt in the Ridge of Veils, but any defeated Sawtooth can be looted for its blood. Once acquired, Aloy returns to Brin who drinks the blood and relays a vision of machine swarms originally being united, part of an 'all-thing' (rather, a hive mind), but suddenly finding themselves confused and without direction. Their shared consciousness was severed for reasons Brin can't relay. He then asks Aloy to bring him the blood of a Corruptor, pointing her to Coiled Canyon's cliffs where she will find Corruptor corpses. Aloy collects the Corruptor blood from the downed machines and returns to Brin, who has a vision of Corruptors ravaging the land and bending other machines to their will. Aloy concurs that this is sort of how Corruptors work, and, surprised, asks how he came to know this; Brin responds cryptically that it is not he who knows, but rather the blood.
Next, he asks Aloy to retrieve blood from the ""hidden machines"" found deep in the Jewel. Aloy acquires the Stalker blood and brings it to Brin, who tells of a vision about the unflinching precision of these machines. They are purely weapons, and only serve the purpose of preying on living things, which Brin finds somewhat sad. However, he then states they're something above mere weapons; an ax doesn't remember its creation, but machines do, and apparently seek to return to the time of the Age of Metal. He next requests blood from a Thunderjaw, noting that they can be found in the eastern valleys. Aloy hunts a Thunderjaw and loots it, returning to Brin for the next vision. He drinks the blood and is struck by a vision that shows Thunderjaws to be young machines created because of humans. Aloy then asks Brin whether there are any machines whose blood he has never tasted. Brin tells her to hunt a Stormbird. Once Aloy takes down this machine and loots the blood for Brin, she returns to his hut for the final vision. Instead, Brin appears frightened by his vision and insists that he and Aloy should leave.

Upon learning that the mayor is too busy with other errands, Aloy volunteers to investigate.
Using her Focus, Aloy discovers a signal within the settlement akin to that of a machine lure. Following the signal to its source, she finds a Carja trader, Shahavad, desperately trying to turn off a machine lure. Once its destroyed, she questions the Carja who tells her he found the device in a workshop atop the Eastern Ridge, bringing it to the settlement despite having no knowledge of what the object was and consequently setting it off.
Following Shahavad's directions, Aloy's way is barred by a Stormbird, attracted by the three lures scattered around the clearing before the workshop. Killing the machine and disabling the lures, Aloy sets to work examining the shop. Finding a discarded letter, she learns the workshop belonged to a tinker named Dervahl, however it has been long abandoned.
Returning to Pitchcliff, Aloy assures Ralert that they will no longer be troubled by Glinthawks, earning his thanks.","Go to Pitchcliff

After delivering her first set of trophies to Ahsis, Aloy speaks to Talanah, who tells her that instead of going after Redmaw, there is something else that needs attending to. Meeting her Hawk outside, Talanah introduces Aloy to Ilsadi, a Carja villager from Lone Light seeking assistance from the Hunters Lodge in clearing out a flock of Glinthawks ravaging the village. Accepting the request, Talanah tells Aloy that she will meet her in Lone Light.

Aloy arrives at Lone Light just as a flock of Glinthawks swoops down into the village. After taking care of the machines together with Talanah, Ilsadi only tells them that regardless of their efforts and of those before them, more always come, with the guards of the nearby Morning's Watch no longer bothering to help defend the village.
Many dead Snapmaws.
Noticing the machines came from upriver, Aloy offers to investigate. To her surprise Talanah urges her to go alone, saying that she will remain in Lone Light in the event more Glinthawks come. Aloy sets off and soon encounters another flock of Glinthawks, as well as a large pile of Snapmaw carcasses that have surely attracted the flying scavengers. Following a lit trail up the rocks, Aloy meets Vashad and Omas, the two hunters responsible.
Dealing with the Hunters[]
Aloy confronting Vashad and Omas.
Vashad explains that he borrowed shards to buy seeds for his farm but his harvest failed, leaving him with nothing to pay off his debt. With the threat of losing everything he owns, including his farm, Vashad turned to hunting for Snapmaw Hearts to pay his loan. Despite learning that the carcasses are attracting Glinthawks, Vashad refuses to leave before he has what he's looking for, with more hunters emerging from hiding.
Vashad and Omas.
At this point, Aloy has two options for dealing with the situation in order to complete the quest. Since Vashad has made it clear that they will not leave without a Snapmaw Heart, Aloy must either get a heart for the hunters or kill Vashad, Omas, and their crew.
She can offer a compromise and propose to get Vashad the last Snapmaw Heart he needs in return for him and his hunting party leaving the site. Aloy must then hunt for the Snapmaw Heart herself or purchase one from the Machine Parts Merchant in Meridian. If Aloy already has a Snapmaw Heart in her inventory, she will automatically give the heart to the hunters without having the choice to make a compromise or asking them to leave.
Alternatively, Aloy can choose to ask the hunters to leave. When the hunting party refuses to go, they will turn hostile and Aloy has to kill them.
Talanah congratulating Aloy.
Once the part is delivered or the hunters are killed, Talanah approaches Aloy and reveals that she was watching the whole time. Impressed with Aloy's performance, she agrees to take her under her wing, with Aloy as her Thrush.

He asks her to investigate a theft that has occurred in his lavish downtown villa. A precious family heirloom has been stolen from his home. Other than his Steward, no one saw the crime in progress despite it occurring in the middle of the day. Ravan insists that despite his anguish, his only concern is for the sword's return. He does not wish retribution and asks Aloy not to punish the thief.
By using her Focus, Aloy discovers a blood trail that spans throughout the city. Following the trail, she talks to a shopkeeper named Keadi who confirms she recently saw a man with a sword steal some bandages from her stand before running off. Aloy continues a short way along the path and speaks to another witness, a Carja noble named Rokasha, who saw the man but insists he was not carrying a sword. Aloy deduces that Keadi may have been withholding information to help the thief. When confronted, Keadi admits that she helped launder the sword but claims the theft was for a good cause. She directs Aloy to visit a Watermill in the lower village and find her friend Kindiv.
Outside Meridian[]
At the Watermill, Kindiv tells Aloy that their group steals from rich nobles and sells the loot to help the needy in Shadow Carja in the Sunfall refugee camp called Shadowside. Kindiv tells her that a member of their group, Nasan, has gone missing near the Branded Shore while delivering a shipment of food and asks for Aloy's help. Although apprehensive about the group's approach, she agrees to help Kindiv if he will return Ravan's sword.
Following Kindiv's suggestion, Aloy tracks Nasan's last whereabouts to a campfire near a fork in the road. She sees blood spatter and other evidence of a struggle and uses her Focus to follow a set of drag marks to a nearby unmarked Shadow Carja outpost. After either dispatching the guards or sneaking inside, she frees Nasan, who stashed the goods nearby. He then continues on his delivery and agrees to visit Ravan to speak about the incident.

The first is an Oseram pilgrim, Brageld, who along with a number of other Oseram wishes to visit the Shrine of Kings to remember those who were held as slave builders. Brageld explains that his lover died in the Sun-Ring under Jiran's reign. As he was one of the slave builders that helped construct the Shrine, he wants to see his lover's handiwork and craftsmanship as a way of remembering and honoring him. However, his way is blocked by a Sun-Priest who refuses to let any Oseram near the Shrine. The priest, known as Abiding Jahamin, states that he wishes to be alone in the retreat, and has little tolerance for outsiders, believing they will defile the shrine. Aloy speaks with Jahamin and learns that he is a loyal follower of the late Sun-King, vocal in his discontent with the current state of the Carja and the Sundom. After hearing enough of Jahamin, Aloy finally convinces the Sun-Priest and his guards to leave. Upon entering, Brageld becomes upset at seeing the vandalized Shrine, saying that by defacing it, the Carja have forgotten and ignored the efforts of the slaves. Aloy departs the mourning Oseram, wishing him peace.
Aloy then makes her way to the Lake Shrine at the edge of the Jewel to assist the Utaru pilgrim, Rea, who came to grieve for her companion who fell while the two were escaping from slavery. After clearing the area of Snapmaws to allow safe passage for Rea, the Utaru explains how she was a slave during Jiran's reign, and during the Liberation managed to escape with her companion, who fell during their getaway. Parting with a warning that the area will not remain safe for long, Aloy leaves to clear the way for the final pilgrim.
To the east of Meridian lies Sun's Climb, a small mesa where a Banuk pilgrim, Kimik, intends to paint a mark of remembrance for the Banuk shamans that vanished during Jiran's reign. However, attracted by the Spire, a number of Glinthawks have perched on the mesa, rendering it unsafe for the Banuk to approach. After defeating the Glinthawks, Kimik paints his mark, briefly explaining to Aloy the meaning and reasoning behind the ritual.

Among them is a high bounty for a Shadow Carja traitor named Uthid who has been accused of conspiring to infiltrate the Citadel and murder the young prince Itamen.
While Aloy listens to Bahavas list Uthid's crimes, a woman in the crowd remarks quietly to Aloy that Uthid has been falsely accused and cryptically requests that Aloy seek her out in Shadowside for more information. Aloy later finds the woman in the Tent City distributing fruit to the impoverished refugee children on behalf of Dowager Queen Nasadi. She introduces herself as Vanasha and explains that Uthid has been set up by Bahavas, vouching for him personally. She urges Aloy to find him before he is killed by the bounty-hunters.
Vanasha has reason to believe Uthid will seek refuge in the Greenclimb. Based on this intel, Aloy heads to the three dead trees ""south"" of Sunfall (but see ""Trivia,"" below) that mark the start of the path. She uses her Focus to follow Uthid's tracks from the trees and up the Greenclimb where she finds an abandoned camp.

Passing through the mountain, Aloy is met with a view of Thunder's Drum looming in the distance, a dark plume of ash continuously billowing from its peak. Noticing a cloud of smoke rising from the nearby village, Aloy enters the Banuk settlement of Song's Edge. Joining the gathering of people, she watches as the Banuk shamans perform the funeral rituals for the hunters that fell during an expedition to the Thunder's Drum. The crowd is then addressed by Aratak, chieftain of the werak that had made the journey, who rallies his hunters to return to the mountain and avenge their fallen kin.

Once the crowd disperses, Aloy learns from the Oseram trader Burgrend that the Banuk shaman Ourea had led the expedition to Thunder's Drum in an attempt to protect an entity known as The Spirit from The Daemon. For reasons not yet entirely understood, the Daemon's presence has caused the increased ferocity and emergence of new machines across The Cut. Intrigued by the Daemon's influence on the machine's behavior, Aloy asks to see Ourea, but Burgrend informs her that she departed soon after returning from the mountain. He instead points her in the direction of her apprentice, Naltuk, who was rumored to be heading north of the river to investigate reports of sudden attacks in the snow and new machines.

Opening the door they continue into the Production Area. After dispatching the Daemonic machines and extending the bridges for Aratak and Ourea to cross, they discover another console. Through this, CYAN reports to have found a potential method to defeat HEPHAESTUS through exploiting the unstable regions of the facility's geothermal system.

Upon redirecting the light source to partially restore CYAN, the AI informs them that HEPHAESTUS is readying thousands of hostile machines. In order to counteract them, she proposes that they destroy regions of the facility; however, this is interrupted by HEPHAESTUS who initiates further defensive measures.

After dispatching the Fireclaw and Control Towers, Aloy attempts to override the Core but is pushed back by a power surge triggered by HEPHAESTUS. Taking up Aloy's spear, Ourea completes the override, expelling HEPHAESTUS and freeing CYAN at the cost of her life.

Recovering from their tumble down the mountain's slope, Aloy and Aratak agree to return to Ourea's Retreat to meet with CYAN.
Aloy arrives at the retreat to catch the last of Aratak's discussion with CYAN who replays a recording of an exchange between the AI and Ourea. After Aratak leaves, Aloy converses with CYAN to learn more about HEPHAESTUS, The Old Ones, the Firebreak Project, and her interactions with Ourea. After their exchange, Aloy meets Aratak outside. The two take a moment to honor Ourea, and Aloy returns Aratak's Chieftain title to him. Aratak informs Aloy that Naltuk has tracked down five Fireclaws that were released from the Cauldron prior to its destruction. Knowing that The Cut will not be safe until they are defeated, Aloy sets off to begin the hunt.","Explore the Cauldron

Obtaining the quest[]
This quest can be obtained in one of two ways. If Aloy speaks to Laulai, she will inform Aloy of a sudden rush of water that has flooded the basin at Deep Din and obstructed her family's legacy. Aloy will offer to investigate. Laulai can be found in Song's Edge, but if Aloy does not speak to her there she will turn up in Longnotch later.
Alternatively, Aloy can bypass Laulai and visit Deep Din or Greycatch on her own. The quest will automatically start when Aloy gets close to one of the locations.","Go to the Lake

https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/The_Survivor,Side_quests,"At Keener's Rock, Aloy encounters the White Teeth, one of the most prestigious weraks in Ban-Ur, who are performing their initiation test: survive four days and four nights on the glaciers in the Knifetrail, sustained only by the land. The Chieftain mentions to Aloy that two of the prospective members have yet to return from the ordeal. To Aloy's disgust, the werak dismisses the idea of going back to search for the two, prompting her to go after them herself.
Venturing into the glacier, Aloy finds one of the hunters, Ikrie. After the two fight off a group of machines, Ikrie explains that she is staying behind for the other hunter, Mailen, who broke her leg descending the ice. Having been friends since childhood, Ikrie refuses to abandon Mailen. However, Mailen refuses to accept any aid, insisting on completing the ordeal on her own.
Ikrie takes Aloy to Mailen, who is now unconscious and surrounded by machines. Once the two fighters kill the machines, as well as the Scorcher that follows, they turn their attention to Mailen. Mailen wakes as Aloy begins splinting her leg, angry at Ikrie for trying to help. Reluctantly allowing Aloy to finish the splint, Mailen begins walking back to the gate alone. Ikrie begs for Mailen's forgiveness; Mailen replies that she should ask the werak instead, to which Ikrie retorts that she didn't care about the werak. Realizing that Ikrie stayed to protect her dream, a favor she would not return, Mailen can only limp away silently.
Heartbroken, Ikrie decides to go her own way, unwilling to join the werak who would leave their own to die. She asks to Aloy to tell the White Teeth she fell on the glacier, which Aloy agrees to do.
Returning to Keener's Rock[]
Mailen makes it back to Keener's Rock before Aloy. Knowing Aloy was involved, the Chieftain asks her to convince him the worth of her word, leading to a flashpoint.

https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Frontier_Justice,Side_quests,"After besting Aratak in the side quest For the Werak and becoming chieftain of the dominant werak in Song's Edge, Aloy returns to the settlement and overhears that a murder has taken place at the nearby Carja camp. Inatut, the accused killer, is about to be exiled from his werak as punishment despite his insistence that the ordeal has been a misunderstanding. Inatut says he was challenged to a brawl by Ruwas, the deceased Carja outlander, and, although witnesses saw the two engaged in a fight, Inatut maintains that he blacked out and has no memory of what occurred. Still, he insists that he would not have delivered a blow strong enough to kill the Carja.
The Investigation[]
After speaking with Inatut, Aloy becomes concerned about a possible miscarriage of justice and decides to investigate the matter herself. She heads to the Carja camp and speaks with Furahni and the Sun-Priest Hishavan, who direct her to a nearby clearing where the fight occurred. There, Aloy uses her Focus to examine evidence and eventually picks up a trail which leads her to a concealed cave. Inside, she finds discarded Carja armor and hears the voices of three Banuk hunters who appear to be discussing their involvement in the crime. Following the voices, Aloy climbs a ridge and finds herself inside the hunters' camp. She is quickly noticed and must engage in battle with Anutai, Naunuk, and Rukul.
Once all three enemies have been defeated, Aloy approaches the mortally wounded Rukul. He admits that he and his partners killed Ruwas and other Carja outlanders who have disappeared in recent years as revenge for the atrocities suffered by the Banuk during the Red Raids. As they speak, a horn sounds in the distance signaling that Inatut has been led out to face his exile in the Cloud-Shear. Aloy decides to head to the Cloud-Shear to help Inatut, but first she searches the camp for more evidence to exonerate him. She discovers Ruwas' missing headdress and other trophies from Carja murders. She then grabs some of the gear and departs for the Cloud-Shear to find the wronged Banuk exile.
Facing Exile[]
Fighting her way past Glinthawks at the base, Aloy reaches the top of the Cloud-Shear. She finds Inatut behind a rock, naked and freezing, and gives him the Carja gear. Just as Inatut finishes dressing, the two are attacked by machines: first a group of Daemonic Scrappers, then Daemonic Frostclaws. After killing the machines with Inatut, Aloy confirms to Inatut that she found the real killers. Inatut heads back on his own, giving himself time to think, while Aloy heads back to Song's Edge to prove Inatut's innocence to his werak.
Aloy brings Ruwas's headress to Kopilai and Aujak, telling them where to find the killers' base and vouching for Inatut's innocence. Aujak insists that the exile was justified, as Inatut was ""guilty of [their] suspicion."" Inatut arrives as Aloy voices her disgust, and assures her that Aujak is speaking for the werak. Kopilai immediately scolds him for wearing Carja clothes, warning him that he must behave like a Banuk if he is to return to the werak. At this comment, Inatut loses his temper, scorning Kopilai for her shortsightedness and storming off.
Aloy finds Inatut overlooking Song's Edge. His anger subsided, Inatut is unsure with how to proceed. Aloy decides what advice to give Inatut, which he agrees to consider. Inatut gives Aloy a gift, both out of gratitude and as a farewell.","Go to the Carja Camp

https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hunters_Three,Side_quests,"When Aloy next returns to Song's Edge after completing The Shaman's Path, Burgrend calls out to her with a proposition. He explains that three young Banuk hunters approached him a few days ago and asked him to outfit them for a long trip. Burgrend furnished them on credit, but when the young hunters returned to pay for their goods they supplied him with a worthless machine part: a Thunderjaw Heart badly damaged due to the hunters' inexperience with harvesting components.
Burgrend then tells Aloy that he is growing concerned for the hunters because he has not seen them since. He asks Aloy to go looking for them, both to confirm their safety and to ensure he is paid back. He explains that the hunters were supposed to bring him three machine parts: a Stalker Sinew, a Scorcher Claw, and a Snapmaw Fang.
Aloy sets off to find the hunters and assist them in gathering the parts needed to pay off their debt.
Scorcher Claw[]
Aloy finds the hunters northeast of Song's Edge, preparing to hunt a Scorcher. While Urkai and Tatai are initially reluctant, Tulemak reminds them that the herd won't stay for long, and they decide to accept her help. The fight is complicated by Longlegs and two nearby Control Towers, but the four manage to kill the machines. Aloy retrieves the Scorcher Claw before speaking with the hunters about their deal with Burgrend.
The hunters (largely due to Urkai's loose tongue) admit that they had a dispute with Onnekut, the chieftain of their old werak, and are leaving to the Sundom for their survival. Tulemak suggests that Aloy accompany them in getting the other two parts they need. Tatai agrees, but warns Aloy that the ""Bloody Snowdrifts"" (a werak name which Tulemak and Urkai quickly reject) aren't accepting new members. After protesting that Tulemak and Urkai haven't offered any better names, Tatai tells Aloy to meet them by the ruins near Hollow Hall.
Stalker Sinew[]
Aloy joins the ""Flaming Skulls"" (Urkai's suggested werak name, which is rejected immediately by his companions) in the northwest to hunt a herd of Stalkers. After an intense battle with Stalkers, Scrappers, Redeye Watchers, and dealing with a Control Tower, Aloy gathers a Stalker sinew and speaks with the hunters again.
The hunters reveal more about the events leading to their flight: Onnekut's status went to his head, and would award spots on the hunt to those who praised him rather than on ability. The hunters' friend Nukoni challenged Onnekut for the title, and was murdered for it. Knowing that Onnekut would target them next, they packed what they could and left. Urkai expresses that matters now is what happens in the Sundom, where the ""Burning Turkeys"" will make a name for themselves (Tatai and Tulemak both express their disbelief at the name)
The three tell Aloy to meet them at the lake due west of them to get the Snapmaw fang.
Snapmaw Fang[]
After some time waiting, the three arrive at the lake, having taken some time to think after their last conversation. Tulemak announces that the ""Sunshine Snowshoes"" await Aloy's signal, causing his companions to laugh at the worst name yet.
Once again, the herd is protected by two control towers, as well as Scrappers and Longlegs. However, the four fight their way through the machines, with Aloy grabbing the final part. Once the fang is grabbed, Aloy and the young werak meet to say goodbye.
Tulemak will ask Aloy how she'll remember their group, presenting her with a flashpoint where each choice will result in a different name for the new werak.

Following the machines' tracks to the edge of Devil's Thirst, the hunting party tracked them down, attacking at dusk. The party was overrun and scattered, and due to the darkness and chaos, Den lost sight of his party. Finding himself alone, he retreated back to Mother's Crown. Fearing for his party but also fearing being cast out for venturing into the forbidden ruins, Den asks Aloy, now a Seeker, to search for his friends.

Balahn ordered the gate to be closed, but learned only afterwards that some men were left behind. One party was attacked outside the Forsaken Village with a single soldier, Walid, managing to escape and report back to Balahn, under orders from Lakhir. Wary of the lingering tension between the Nora and Carja, Balahn admits that he does not want to risk sending more guards so close to the Sacred Lands, and thus requests Aloy's assistance in finding the lost men in return for any information she may desire on the Carja and the Sundom in general.

Prompted to explain further, Fernund tells Aloy that many outlanders hid their valuables from raiders during the reign of the Mad Sun-King Jiran. Fernund claims to have located a valuable relic from the Old Ones stashed out of his reach in the Dusk Mesa. He offers to split the proceeds from the relic's sale with Aloy should she recover it for him. Although seemingly suspicious, Aloy agrees to retrieve the relic and bring it to Fernund in Meridian Village.
At Dusk Mesa, Aloy climbs the rock formation and is surprised to discover a small chest, indicating that Fernund was telling the truth. However, she opens the chest and finds it empty. At this moment, Fernund appears from below and calls out to Aloy, explaining that the relic story was a ruse to lure her to his ambush point.

Aloy refuses and must defeat or evade the outlander mercenaries hired by Fernund, who disappears during the commotion.

Kaeluf tells her that two of his friends have gone in pursuit of a convoy of Behemoths to harvest their cables for Oseram Cannons. He explains that Petra initially assigned the task to himself and Beladga, however aware that Beladga and Jorgriz are fond of each other, he agreed to trade places with Jorgriz so the two hunters could spend more time together. Realizing too late that they may be too preoccupied with each other to reach the convoy in time, Kaeluf is worried that they will not be able to get the parts they need. As Kaeluf is unable to go after them himself as he is on guard duty, Aloy offers to look for Jorgriz and Beladga and get the Behemoth cables.

Approaching them, Jorgriz and Beladga continue to argue between themselves, each blaming the other for why they missed the herd. Having had enough of their bickering, Aloy bluntly states that the reason they couldn't reach their destination in time came down to the fact that they both wanted to spend more time with the other. The three hunters then agree to work together to bring down the herd and gather the cables, heading to the place Beladga and Jorgriz last saw the herd. Reaching the ridge, they follow the herd's tracks.

After harvesting the Behemoth cables, Beladga and Jorgriz announce that they've figured out how they're going to be together.

After delivering the cables, Kaeluf informs Aloy that as punishment, Petra has assigned him to a month of guard duty.

https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Healer%27s_Oath,Errands,"While in the tent city outside the Shadow Carja settlement at Sunfall, Aloy encounters a young man named Abas. His sister Shianah is gravely ill, due to the desperate conditions in the tent city. Aloy asks him how she can help. He tells her of a healer named Ghaliv at Blazon Arch, another Shadow Carja settlement south of Sunfall. However, he despondently tells Aloy that Ghaliv will not help, due to his callous nature, only interested in profit, and they have nothing to compensate him.
Outraged, Aloy goes to Blazon Arch and confront Ghaliv. She implies that she will coerce him to go and treat the girl, by force if necessary. However, he is unmoved, as, in addition to his callous, profit-driven nature, he fears reprisal by the Shadow Carja leadership for using his limited resources to treat a tent city occupant rather than Shadow Carja soldiers much more than anything Aloy could do to him.
However, even this fear is trumped by his desire for profit. He offers Aloy a deal: he will go and treat the girl if she brings him the heart of a Thunderjaw, a very valuable item. He even tells her of a location not far from Blazon Arch where she can find a Thunderjaw, known as the Valley of Omens, and tells her to meet her at the tent city, where he will take the heart and treat the girl.
Aloy agrees, with a warning that she will not tolerate his reneging on the deal. She goes after the Thunderjaw, finds it, kills it, and gets the heart. She returns to the tent city and finds Ghaliv. She gives him the heart and sternly warns him to keep his end of the deal. Laconically, he agrees and treats the girl.","Talk to Ghaliv and ask him to help Shianah.

https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/A_Secret_Shared,Errands,"At the Banuk dye camp, 130m north of Song's Edge, a shaman named Kamut is found standing on a small, enshrined wooden dock. He calls out to Aloy and compliments her spear before offering her a way to improve it. He points her north to an abandoned cave full of ""metal birds"" left behind by the Old Ones and instructs her to find a rail inside one that has not yet been stripped of its parts.
The cave is actually a ruined bunker called the Drone Hangar in the northernmost part of the Cut. When Aloy descends into the ruin, she sets off a Stalker mine but the machine will not appear. The accessible ""metal bird"" has been stripped and does not contain the part she needs. In order to reach the untouched drone behind the wall, Aloy must climb the nearby ladder and use the handholds to cross the gap towards a small ledge with a console on it. Activating the console moves one of the drones into a position that allows Aloy to climb on top of it and access the ledge in the back right corner.
After using the handhold to climb into the hallway, the way is now blocked by a familiar Holo-Lock. Aloy can find the password by scanning the code nexus with her Focus or listening to the nearby datapoint. Aloy continues through the halls until reaching the pristine drone and taking the rail part from its nose. After scaling the wall using handholds, the Stalker will appear.
Once Aloy has escaped the ruin and returned to Kamut he will show her how to attach the part to her spear, giving her the ability to modify it with improved damage modifications. Kamut goes on to explain his reason for helping Aloy: he is concerned that the shamans are not doing enough to combat the new dangers the Banuk are facing.","Find Rail Part

https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Geared_Up:_Forgefire,Errands,"In Longnotch, Aloy encounters Burgrend's daughter Varga, an Oseram tinker with a special interest in technologically-advanced ranged weapons. Among these is the Forgefire, a fire-spitting weapon.
A month earlier, Varga was commissioned by a fellow Oseram named Ohlgrud to craft a weapon that would shoot flames similar to the attack of a Fire Bellowback; she designed the Forgefire in response. Eventually, Ohlgrud requested to see Varga's progress, but instead ambushed her with a crew of bandits and stole the unfinished weapon. He now wields the Forgefire and presides over the only bandit camp in the Cut, Stone Yield.
This quest can be started after killing Ohlgrud and recovering the Forgefire. Aloy can visit Varga, who will offer to finish the weapon. To do so, she needs the snout from either a Fire or Freeze Bellowback. Despite offering to participate in the machine hunts required to upgrade the Icerail and Stormslinger, Varga asks Aloy to hunt the Bellowback on her own.
Varga makes some adjustments and returns an Improved Forgefire to Aloy, expressing gratitude that her creation is no longer in the hands of a bandit.","Gather a Bellowback Snout

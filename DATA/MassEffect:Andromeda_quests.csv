https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/First_Strike,"Prerequisite: Nexus Reunion
Interact with the Strike Team terminal next to Tiran Kandros in the Militia Office on the Nexus to begin this mission.","Speak to Kandros on the Nexus or via the Tempest's vidcon[]
Upon first activating the terminal, SAM tells Pathfinder Ryder that he does not have sufficient authorization to access that function. Speak with Kandros in person on the Nexus or via vidcon to gain the authorization required.
Inspect available Strike Team missions[]
See also: Strike TeamsPay attention to the blinking orange light beneath the hologram
Use either the Strike Team terminal in the Nexus security office or onboard the Tempest to view available operations. This will complete the mission.
Note: It is not necessary to undertake any of the online multiplayer missions to complete the game storyline."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Hunting_the_Archon,"Prerequisite: A Trail of Hope II
Automatically acquired following the confrontation between Evfra and the Moshae in his office in the Resistance Headquarters.","This mission can be thought of as divided into two major parts: intelligence gathering and infiltration. Combat isn't mandatory in the first part, and you have ample time to properly configure your loadouts before going into the second part. Both parts require making a couple of permanent binary choices that decide which characters will be present going forward.
Go to Kadara Port in the Govorkam System[]
During the landing on Kadara, Pathfinder Ryder receives a message from Evfra de Tershaav with new information on the traitor and that the contact's code name is Shena. The mission is updated with the next objective after the Tempest has landed.
The message is unsubtle, but effective
Drack and Vetra accompany you up to Kadara Port's observation deck, where they announce they have a ""completely legitimate business deal"" to attend to and leave you to your own devices. At this point, you can only roam around Kadara Port since access to Kadara Slums below and the rest of the planet is restricted while Liam negotiates parking space for the Nomad.
Note: Returning to the Tempest for the first time after arriving on Kadara will trigger a team meeting called by Drack, unlocking the Priority Ops Elaaden: A New World and H-047c: A New World as well as a number of other side missions. None of these new missions need to be dealt with right away.

Speak to the Resistance contact at Kralla's Song.[]
Reyes Vidal, human smuggler with angaran nickname
The contact at Kralla's Song is a man named Reyes Vidal. The traitor Vehn Terev is in prison because the people in Kadara don't like what he did to the Moshae. As the port's leader Sloane Kelly is a ""woman of the people,"" Vehn is facing execution. Because Sloane was part of the uprising on the Nexus, she can't be expected to give up Vehn easily to someone who works for the Nexus. Vidal suggests that Ryder works Sloane while he talks with the angaran Resistance.
At the conclusion of the talk, bartender Umi Henon badgers you to pay for the drinks Reyes ordered, regardless of whether you took one or not, though no actual credits are spent. Exiting the bar, SAM gives you a brief overview of Sloane.
Meet Sloane Kelly in the Outcast headquarters on Kadara Port[]
The conversation with Sloane Kelly can go a few ways. She asks about your concern with Vehn Terev, and you can either be honest with her, or say it's none of her business.
Someone's channeling Aria in Andromeda
If you truthfully answer Sloane's question and accept her counterproposal without fuss, she allows you to see Vehn. The holding cells of Outcast Headquarters becomes accessible, and the guards there warn you against contact other than talking. She also lets you stay around her throne room for asking her follow-up questions and the like. The other two outcomes result in Sloane's chamber temporarily locking out and requiring Reyes' assistance outside to advance the mission.
If you don't want to tell Sloane why you need to see Vehn, Sloane signals her aide, who draws a pistol at you. A narrative action prompt appears, though whether you take it or not the result is the same: you back out of the room.
If you tell Sloane you want Vehn's intel, but insist his punishment is not up to her, she dismisses you.
Speak to Reyes Vidal[]
For some reason he thinks it's a good idea to discuss undermining the local authority right outside said authority's headquarters
If negotiations with Sloane failed, Reyes is waiting outside the Outcast Headquarters. He gives you access codes for a maintenance shaft that can be used to reach Vehn, along with something that will break the traitor out of the prison.
If you're planning to start a romance with Reyes, an opportunity to flirt will appear in the conversational choices.
Enter the holding cells through the maintenance shaft[]
Around the corner of the armor shop in Kadara Market will be a navpoint to a console. This console will open a section of floor grating leading to a tunnel. Enter the tunnel and a second console will open another section of floor grating so that you can climb up into the stockroom leading to Vehn.
Interrogate Vehn Terev[]
The door on the left is the main entrance of the prison while the door on the far side leads to the prison stockroom and the secret maintenance shaft
If Sloane granted you access to Vehn Terev, the door beyond the prison is open. If not, it's closed, and nobody finds out you're there. Either way, Vehn doesn't know where the Archon's ship is, but he suggests that Ryder use the transponder he buried outside town to triangulate the Archon's position.
Depending on how your meeting with Sloane went, Vehn will either be left in prison (Sloane gave permission), or he breaks out of jail to be spirited away by the Angaran Resistance (you pissed off Sloane). If Vehn escaped prison, a datapad detailing what the Outcasts did to address the security leak will show up on your next return to the market, next to the entrance of the maintenance shaft. The datapad will remain there for subsequent visits to the market though the maintenance shaft will be sealed next time.
The Kadara Slums below the port is now accessible, and with it access to the world's other locations. If you antagonized Sloane, the lockout to her throne room ends once you take the port elevator down to the slums. Note:  Using the transit console to go to the Tempest and return does not count.
Retrieve the kett transponder from the badlands[]
While going from Outcast Headquarters to The Docks for this section of the mission, you may encounter a dead angaran body in the market. This unlocks the Heleus Assignment Murder in Kadara Port. Note that it's possible to sidestep acquisition by going around the corpse through the Mods Merchant's section of the market.
Not really ""buried"" when it's out in the open and easily seen, is it
Take the elevator to the slums from the docks. Go outside to discover Haarfel, call down a Forward Station to its nearby location, and deploy the Nomad for faster travel. Go to the navpoint at Charybdis Point in the Sulfur Springs region and pick up the transponder lying under the taller buildings. The transponder power source is drained but Ryder thinks Gil Brodie can fix it.
Note that while you can encounter numerous aggressive wildlife, Remnant, or Outlaws while going to Charybdis Point, none of them are mandatory fights and you can easily reach the destination without firing a shot biotic or otherwise.
Speak to Gil in Tempest engineering[]
Return to the Tempest. The fastest way is by hopping into the Nomad and calling for extraction. Once aboard, speak to Gil. After accidentally contacting the kett on the other side Gil shuts that off and gets the transponder working: it points to a location in the Tafeno system.
Locate the kett flagship in the Tafeno system[]
Leaving one galaxy only to be arkjacked upon arriving in the next
Upon entering the Tafeno system, the Tempest goes into stealth mode. The kett flagship Verakan has captured the salarian ark Paarchero holding it with several tethers. The flagship is unaware of the Tempest's presence. The ark is undamaged and its power on standby but the fate of the salarians is unknown.
Access the Paarchero's docking bay to mark this section complete and begin the final leg of this mission. This is a point of no return and saving is disabled for the rest of the mission except for autosaves. Prepare your loadouts, squadmates, skill distributions and other configurations accordingly.
Ryder contacts the Moshae to learn exactly what they are looking for. It's a Remnant relic depicting Meridian and it's kept in the Archon's chamber.
The plan is to board the ark and sneak into the flagship through the tethers.
Patch SAM into the ark's systems[]
Your team will begin in the cryobay, specifically Medical Bay A12. +270 XP is awarded at level start.
Between the second and third beds to the right (east) is a lootable container. At the second bed to the left (west) is a datapad that can be read for additional details.
Communications blackout
Message from the Captain:

URGENT: Alien vessels have been detected within the system.
Effective immediately, all external communications are restricted, to avoid revealing Ark Paarchero's position. The unknown celestial phenomenon continues to disrupt long-range scans. Positions of the Nexus, Ark Hyperion, Ark Leusinia, and Ark Natanus remain unknown.
Access the console at the far end of the room to patch SAM in. It's similar to the one on Hyperion, except the salarians added additional data encryption in. Accessing any of the available options there starts off normally then invariably changes into a message by Paarchero's captain Lumont Hayjer explaining they have been captured by hostile aliens and their Pathfinder Zevin Raeka must be located. Afterward, SAM overrides the bulkhead door to the right. You are ejected out of the console control after seeing any of the options, although you can access it again to explore the other two if you wish.
Locate the salarian Pathfinder, Zevin Raeka[]
The kett have been busy, but not working fast enough
Head to the right through a doorway into the ark's cryobay proper. Again, similar to the Hyperion's, only this time there are some kett equipment strewn about. Learning that most of the ark is in good condition and flight-ready, Ryder suggests stealing the ark from the kett. They can pull it off as long as the right salarians are still on board. The squadmates have reactions to that, as well as on the observation that there appears to be no signs of struggle.
A couple of green T-shaped devices are scannable in the corridor. Scan one to learn it's called a Kett Forklift (+10), used to unload the ship's cryopods.
Straight ahead in the corridor and through another doorway leads to Medical Bay A13. +270 XP is awarded for entering the room.
Right across from the door next to a bunch of cryopods there is an Adapted Initiative Core Tech that can be scanned for +100. On the first bed to the right (east) is another datapad that can be read for additional details.
Cease hostilities
URGENT: By agreement of the ark's senior leadership, cease all defensive operations against the alien vessels. The risk of catastrophic damage to the ark and colonists is too high.

Seems another Pathfinder was lost, what a downer, but wait is that a lootable box with potentially rare gear inside?
There are two dead salarians on medical beds, one on the second bed right (east) and one on the third bed left (west). The latter one is next to an active console, and is the one you're looking for. Accessing the console completes this section, while scanning the salarian (+10) is a requirement in the next. From the console you'll learn that the corpse is labeled ""Zevin Raeka"", although Initiative records list the Pathfinder as female while the corpse is male.
There's also a lootable container in the same row as the fake Pathfinder corpse, near the inaccessible door.
Identify the dead salarian[]
If you haven't done it yet, scan the dead salarian to get a DNA sample. There is minor dialogue change with SAM depending on whether you scanned the body before or after accessing the console.
You need to take the sample to a medical terminal for analysis. A new navpoint will be added pointing to the terminal in the room, in between two plants and near the Adapted Initiative Core Tech earlier. Interacting with the terminal reveals that the dead salarian is actually Jeks Arlan based on a DNA match and not the Pathfinder. With the switcheroo confirmed, Ryder suggests checking Jeks Arlan's cryopod if the real Pathfinder's there. One of your squadmates remarks on the salarians' sneakiness afterward.
Locate the dead salarian's stasis pod[]
PROTIP: scan them all
A new navpoint will be added back down the cryobay corridor you came through earlier. More squadmate banter concerning the number of missing pods is there. Ryder's optimistic but the evidence suggests otherwise.
Pull up your scanner and you should see a highlighted pod or three, depending on distance, near the door to Medical Bay A12. Scan them in any order: the first two are decoys while the last one always contains the Pathfinder. Each pod awards +10 (+30 total).
Revive the salarian Pathfinder[]
To the right of the pods is a console that can be interacted with to revive the Pathfinder. This is a point of no return, so scan everything and loot every box in the connected rooms if need be.
One of the original four Pathfinders is back in service
The scene changes to Medical Bay A12. Raeka wakes up, her recovery near-instantaneous because of salarian metabolism. She briefs Ryder: the captain surrendered so they would live to fight another day, and ordered the Pathfinder to hide among the population and dismantle her SAM to avoid detection.
Ryder asks her to wake up a flight crew and be ready to fly the ship away, while your team infiltrates the kett ship through the tethers to gather intel. She offers to work on freeing the ark after waking the crew, and you can encourage or discourage her on that. With Raeka's own SAM inactive, Ryder's SAM connects to her so she has the assistance of an AI. Afterward your squad walks over to the other ship using a tether.
Infiltrate the kett ship[]
You resume control after arriving in front of a door on the kett ship, and an autosave is generated. Opening the door immediately leads to a fight - so much for the element of surprise.
The game would be a whole lot shorter if the kett actually had standard-issue death rays
You're on the outer decks, specifically a docking bay, with an initial 3 Chosen welcoming party upstairs, plus 2 more and a Destined as reinforcements coming in from the west when you've killed the first guys. The first 3 Chosen usually start to the right of the door, one level up, so aim your guns in that direction for efficiency. Listen to your squadmates: aside from the snarky banter they also give sound tactical advice. You start at a low ground disadvantage so work your way up when you see an opening.
There is a container on the entry level that can be looted, on the left from the entrance and near a window. There's also an ammo supply cache upstairs from that, by a support column. Lastly, another container next to the console relevant to the next objective.
Patch SAM into the kett ship's systems[]
A perfect location for a kett-salarian tourist trap if the former's belligerence is ever dealt with
All doors leading farther into the ship (east and west) are locked at the moment. Interact with the console at the navpoint, on a platform above the docking bay door. SAM locates the Archon's chamber and has counteracted an alert temporarily. The info doesn't say if the Archon is in his chamber though.
You can interface with the console again after leaving it the first time.
Send the salarian Pathfinder team on their way[]
When you exit the console, Raeka, captain Hayjer, and 2 salarian colonists also show up in the docking bay, either below the ramp or at the general area by the supports, and explain they're there to rescue their fellow salarians trapped aboard the ship. They're talking through comms even if you run up right next to them. Two of the salarians are just civilians, but Raeka and Hayjer encourage them to be creative in leveraging their particular skills.
A teacher, a drive core specialist, a Pathfinder, and a captain walk into a bar...
A new navpoint will point to another console on the middle level, toward the eastern door. The salarians need your SAM to override the door through that console, so go there and assist. As you have your own mission, you cannot accompany them (the game prevents you from proceeding through the open door).
Make your way to the Archon's private chamber[]
Afterward, you query SAM for directions, and the door to the west is now unlocked. Your squadmates quip about the odds: three of you vs. a ship full of kett. A new navpoint will be added in the opposite direction that the salarians headed.
This is the lengthiest section of the flagship infiltration objective, repeated 3 times in the journal between 3 sub-objectives that will arise and be completed naturally as you progress.
Along the way to the navpoint are two containers in the armory room right before the hangar. Your squadmates may have comments here.
Just before the ramp to the door to next area, your radar will register enemy dots and an autosave is generated. This is a point of no return for the docking bay you left behind so ensure you have no further business there before crossing this.
Go nuts on the wide-open battlefield
When you open the door you arrive at a spacious hangar. If you have been playing multiplayer the layout should be familiar as it's similar to the main battleground of Firebase Nimbus, give or take a few things. The kett initially have their backs turned on you so you have the element of surprise up until one of them notices your team.
The alarm starts sounding. Enemy headcount is at least 2 Destined and 3 Chosen initially, then a dropship worth of the same, and then more of the same, plus maybe an Anointed, arriving from the doors at the far end. There are numerous explosive canisters in the area, take advantage of them.
Once you've killed everyone there SAM says you're still on course to the Archon's chambers, and your squadmates hope the Moshae is right about the relic there. It's possible to just ignore the enemies and rush to the next area, though of course at the expense of experience and possibly items.
Who says player characters are the only ones who can steal stuff?
There are 3 ammo caches and 1 health cache in the hangar. The Kett Fighters docked at the circular pads can be scanned for +10. On the left side in the second hangar bay is a large lootable container. On the higher portion of the area is another lootable container, on the side closer to the initial entrance.
On the lowest area there are Paarchero equipment indicating the kett have been looting the ark, and the other squadmates also have their say. No sign of the salarian passengers though, so you hope Raeka has better luck. There are two datapads telling some of the Archon's intentions, an audio log from the Primus telling what's to be done with the stuff, and a small container on the left side just after the audio log.
Preliminary report on alien vessel
Translated from Tonaizhet:

Initial reports indicate the vessel contains a large number of intelligent bipedal aliens in some form of hibernation. They all appear to be alive. Preliminary tests suggest this vessel is not from our galaxy. Inform the Archon at once.
Additional report on alien vessel
Translated from Tonaizhet: 

After further inventory, the vessel does not appear to contain any weaponry that could pose a risk to our forces. The medical and science equipment warrants further study. The most important discovery is the sleeping aliens, who number almost 20,000. Their genetic patterns are unlike any encountered before.
There are only two doors going forward, on the ground level and on the upper level. Both lead to the same area, you can jump from the lower to the upper level and vice versa. Raeka checks in asking about the alarms, because you tripped them and they are undetected thus far. Through the upper door, you can find a container to the left down a small ramp. In the lower area underneath the walkway is a Kett Core Encryption Tech (+100).
The ""scientist"" is a bit of a drama queen and prefers the dark
In the next area is a hostile ""Scientist"" (just an unarmed Destined if you scan it) and a container that can be looted. The Scientist quickly runs toward the eastern door but if you're faster you can kill it (can't take any chances, as your Ryder says).
The scientist was looking at two salarian stasis pods. One of them belongs to Dr. Medrow Aden, who may be encountered later, during the mission Truth and Trespass. Both pods belong to members of the ark leadership and both of them are empty, which may elicit some comments from the squad.
In the opposite direction, you can continue through the 2-door system to the next room. An autosave is generated prior to the second door. This is now a point of no return for the hangar.
One of your squad has always got to jinx things by noting how the room is ""quiet""
You arrive at the Gun Battery, part of the Verakan's inner decks. Ryder sees powerful guns pointing at the ark and they will be a problem. The gun battery is empty of enemies at the moment, you can explore for a bit. It has 3 ammo caches and 2 health caches. There is one container in the platform above the way you came in. Your squad also has some comments on the gun battery as long as you dither about in the room.
If you investigate the consoles at the window and the hologram at the ops center, you learn that SAM can't disable the guns because authorization from the Archon is required. The holo is a firing solution to the ark targeting the stasis holds to ensure maximum destruction. Head to the navpoint at the other side of the room when you're ready.
Survive the ambush[]
No matter the galaxy there's always a doggo equivalent nice to friendlies and brutal to enemies
When trying to leave the room the door becomes locked, and numerous kett attack, spawning from the other doors. The room with the empty stasis pods you came from is now also inaccessible. It should be expected by now: large ""empty"" room plus supply caches (and occasionally a bunch of explosive canisters) means a fight will happen. Defeat the enemies.
The enemy composition is Chosen, Destined, Anointed, later followed by Wraiths, and finally an Ascendant. You have two floors to jump around, though of course high ground is always an advantage. Plenty of guardrail cover there too, just be wary when parking behind orange sections as those are breakable. Be on alert for flanking Wraiths as there are few locations where you don't need to watch your back.
Fortunately, Raeka and her team later emerge at the inaccessible highest platform above and lay down covering fire. They withdraw after a while when one of the colonists, Seldin the history teacher, gets hit, though you'll have the situation under control by then.
Once all enemies are down an autosave is generated and the sub-objective is marked completed.
A new navpoint is added after the battle as SAM finds another way to the Archon's room. Proceed to the upper door in the center of the room.
Continuing up the ramp, on the right side at the top is a lootable container.
Raeka hypes her bombmaker guy while SAM opens the doors
In the next room you meet the salarian team behind an indestructible window, down to 3 as Seldin died of his wounds. They need help unlocking a door, the console is on your side. The door forward on your side is also locked, so use the console.
Ryder warns the salarians of the Gun Battery and they have a solution. Venro, the surviving civilian, used to repair FTL drives and can repurpose one to make an EMP bomb. He and Hayjer focus on the EMP while Raeka goes on alone to search for her missing people.
After the conversation one of your squadmates complains about keeping your voices down as the enemy already knows you're here. Banter shenanigans occur.
The empty halls aren't a complete waste of space; they have the occasional lootable crate in them
The next 2 rooms after this prove staying quiet is unnecessary as there are no enemies. In the first room there's a small container in the first alcove on the right. The second room is some sort of reception area with 2 containers that can be looted. If you dally about here your squadmates ask how many salarians will be left if they fail to rescue the ark, and the answer is not enough.
When you attempt to proceed to the navpoint the door shuts out. A new navpoint appears and points to the door to the right, but it also gets locked out. The kett are playing hardball with their security.
Bypass kett security[]
Knock knock. Who's there? Gosad nura. Gosad nura who? Gosad nura deez nuts GOTEM
Scan the nearby Security Access Panel on the left side of the doorway. Interact with the console to learn that it is voice-controlled. SAM modulates Ryder's voice to sound like a kett. The intercom asks for authorization, and you can respond in two ways: speaking kett, or claiming you're extra security. If you try to speak their language Ryder botches the job and is denied access, though there's no  real penalty as you can try again for the other option.
The doorway leads into Laboratory 16. An autosave is generated and the sub-objective is marked complete just before you proceed.
The general layout of the lab is a very long hallway with observation windows peering into side chambers on both sides, some of which are accessible. However, the hallway is partitioned by locked doors, so you have to go in and out through the side chambers which contain raw materials or experiments. Squadmates comment on your new location, and there's a datapad in the hallway you arrive in.
Specimen analysis
Translated from Tonaizhet: 

Notable findings for further study: 

 *High metabolic rate
 *Sleep requirements very low
 *Accelerated mental acuity and memory functions 

Weaknesses: 

 *Short-lived
 *Muscle strength lacking

The daily life of an average kett scientist involves loafing around or performing experiments under terrible lighting
Enemy red dots register on your radar, they are literally next door, and there's a clear observation window separating the hallway you're in and the hostiles, but they don't seem to mind your presence for now. If you do move to their area you see that they're just unarmed scientists and will run away fast to the west. Killing or not killing them makes no difference.
The chamber the scientists vacated has a bunch of interactable objects. Just in front of the entrance there's a console that opens the wall behind it, revealing a small room with a lootable container. Along the walls are Exaltation Pods (+10). In the middle of the room is an ammo cache, between two operating theaters. One is empty and the other has a kaerkyn specimen in suspension, next to two consoles. Using the console near the window of either operating theater tints the window and back, while using the other one by the kaerkyn frees the bug and turns it hostile. Another console at the end of the chamber functions the same as its counterpart on the other end, opens/closes a tunnel wall leading to a small room, but this one is empty except for an Exaltation Pod. You'll be seeing a lot of these tunnel walls with small rooms - some accessible, some not - as you go through the lab.
Now accepting audience requests, except power ballads and Dragonforce songs
When you depart the room and into the hallway there's a bunch of kett with guns, alerted by the fleeing scientists who are nowhere to be found if you didn't kill them. They are two Anointed, a Destined, and a Chosen. They have already taken up defensive positions in the room. Deal with them. Squadmates are quite talkative during and after this skirmish. Note:  The small rooms behind tunnel walls function as one-hit-kill areas. If you fling an enemy there, or drag one to it with Pull, it will die on hitting the ground.
Further into the next side chamber are salarian stasis pods. Before jumping down, loot the container beyond the tunnel wall to the south. There's also an ammo cache if you need it.
A few salarians' screaming deaths is worth a few dozen research points or so
There are about 18 scannable Initiative pods mixed in with Exaltation Pods. The Initiative pods go for +10  each. However, the actual number of pods you can scan is limited to how fast the conversation about it concludes. You and your squadmates chat about the pods being empty, and immediately afterward all pods cease being highlighted red in your scanner regardless of whether you actually got them. The arrangement of pods in the pit further makes it clear it's impossible to scan all 18 pods in that short timeframe.
There is another lootable container in the alcove on the right in this lower area. There's also another tunnel wall console when you jump back up, but don't bother with it as it leads to an empty room.
Don't mind us; just relaxing for a bit in between rounds of horrific vivisections
You emerge at the third and final hallway section of the lab. There are four dead salarians near the doorway navpoint, going for +10  each, and like the stasis pods earlier once the conversation about them stops they are all marked scanned regardless of whether you actually did (fortunately this one's easier: longer conversation, only 4 scans). Organs were removed from them while they were still alive. Your squadmates express horror and revulsion at the sight. There is another lootable container just past the dead salarians and a datapad.
Additional specimen request
Translated from Tonaizhet:

Current testing population is depleted. Specimens expire quickly when subjected to examination. Request more live specimens be transferred from captured enemy vessel on orders from the Archon.
In the observation window you can see 2 scientists ""working"" on a live salarian in the next room. You can focus look at the point of interest and your squadmates may bellow threats, but it's futile as there is actually no way in there. One of the scientists goes to a console and darkens the window afterward.
Exit the lab through the doorway navpoint once you've explored and looted the place to your satisfaction. On opening the door you'll immediately see a bunch of kett scientists running to the north door, and a bunch of kett goons pour in from that door.
Attack dogs in unexpected places
Defeat the kett. Headcount is a Chosen, an Anointed, and 2 Wraiths in an open hallway. Having been denied blood in the lab earlier, your squadmates settle for this opportunity to vent their anger. You'll be sitting ducks for the Anointed's Soned due to the lack of nearby cover in the hallway, so backtrack to the lab if necessary to bait the Wraiths. Once the beasts are down it's a trivial issue to deal with just 2 kett, cover or no cover.
There are two lootable containers in the hallway: one by the seats to the west and one next to the northern door. There's also an ammo cache in the middle of the hall.
Head to the navpoint to the northern door. It locks out on approach and the navpoint pivots to the one due west. Accessing the door generates an autosave and then a cutscene.
The big bad of Heleus himself deems you almost worthy enough to be his ""rival""
The next room is the central laboratory. There, your team is caught and suspended in an energy field and the Archon enters, guarded by his yet-unintroduced lackey. You have a chance to respond to his bad-guy speech, though whatever you say to him he'll grab Ryder's neck, eliciting cries of concern from your squad. He injects a biological transmitter into Ryder's bloodstream and taunts the Pathfinder to save their strength as this is the first sample. The Archon is interrupted by an alert of another problem somewhere else - probably the salarian team - and leaves.
SAM mentions that he would attempt to remove the Bio Tracker injected by Archon, though that's second priority compared to getting out. SAM suggests an unpleasant way to escape the field: stop Ryder's heart to fool the containment field into releasing ""dead"" weight. Whichever your response, you agree to the plan and ""die"" for the second time, freeing you from the field. SAM then cardiovascularly stimulates Ryder's heart twice before coming back to life. You resume control after Ryder frees the rest of the team.
Escape the trap[]
Raeka hijacks the ship's loudspeakers and taunts the Archon's forces. On comms with you she explains it's a diversion to give Hayjer and Venro time to set up the EMP device.
Half-expecting a fight with the Archon here, were you?
The central lab is huge and looks like an arena for a boss fight, though it isn't. It's merely a trove of kett intelligence gathered from several sources. There's no time pressure for busting out, take as much time as you need to learn what you can from the enemy.
There are numerous audio logs from the Primus and Archon interrogating the salarians and the Moshae.
The large Holding Tank can be scanned (+10 ) and a lootable container is next to the tank. On the wall behind the two is a health cache.
In the east room, there are more audio logs, a lootable container, and a Kett Core Encryption Tech (+100 ).
There are two entrances to the west room. There is a lootable container next to each entrance.
In the west room there are holographic images of the Milky Way races and the Archon assesses their useful genetic traits. There is a datapad in the table and a lootable container at the nearest door to these.
Specimen search
Translated from Tonaizhet:

Archon, as you ordered: search teams have been dispersed to find more specimens from the Milky Way. The salarian specimens claim knowledge of additional species called ""human,"" ""turian,"" ""krogan,"" and ""asari."" We are in the process of collecting members of all species for study and eventual exaltation.

The kett have been making notes and it's only fair you're making notes of them making notes
The large tunnel wall to the south can be scanned and is identified as a maintenance hatch. Use the Maintenance Hatch console at the center of the holo room to open a way out through the Maintenance Corridor. A new navpoint will then be added. Climb up and through the newly opened corridor. Note:  If you already used the console before scanning the tunnel wall, you can still scan it for no research points.
There is a one-way drop at the end of the corridor leading further into the maintenance tunnel. Going through it completes this section and generates an autosave.
The maintenance corridor is in near-total darkness, lighted primarily by your armor's flashlight. You will hear screaming in the distance and encounter more empty salarian stasis pods. Fortunately the path is straightforward, just alternating between due west and north. Along the way your squadmates may voice their opinions on the kett being as evil as the worst they left behind in the Milky Way.
Imagine being unarmed while one of these things is stalking you in the dark, and they can cloak
There are four containers to loot along the path, and no scannable objects except for the empty stasis pods (which also award no research points). A single Wraith will roar in the distance then come out of the shadows at you, when you're headed north past the room with windows and the third lootable container. Kill the animal then look for the single salarian corpse in the area. Your squadmates suppose he may have escaped through the ducts, and the animal was unleashed to hunt him. Scanning the corpse awards +10. The fourth lootable container is also in the vicinity.
Past the room with the dead salarian Raeka reports over comms that she has found some of her people still alive and is heading to them. The EMP is also armed and ready.
The corridor exits to the Antechamber. There are two lootable containers in the Antechamber, on opposite sides of the room, unlighted because Ryder switches off their lights even though the lighting here is also terrible.
Accessing the door starts a cutscene and generates an autosave. There are more large holding tanks, most holding salarians, and one holding something that looks like a krogan but heavily modified - one of Drack's missing scouts. Gruesome indications that kett are making progress in their studies of exalting Milky Way species. After discussing the tanks, your squad finally enter the Archon's room.
Find the relic[]
The relic is at the right, but meanwhile scan the floating blocks in the way for extra points
The door locks when you go inside the chamber. Including the main objective, there are 11 Remnant objects in the room that can be scanned for +10 (+110 total). Some are the equivalent of junk but the Archon doesn't know better. Scan them before accessing the objective as they will become unavailable later.
There is also a Kett Core Encryption Tech (+100 ). On the left side of the room is a lootable container. Paarchero is viewable to the south; Ryder has some comments here before and after achieving the main objective. Take note of the supply cache locations here, if you think this room is suspiciously shaped like a boss fight zone you are right.
The Meridian relic is in the other end of the room, opposite of the only door. Accessing it reveals a map showing the location of Meridian as well as its shape. The Archon shows up as a holographic image and is arrogant to Ryder. Unfortunately the Archon now knows about SAM. The Archon says he will destroy their ships and Ryder immediately alerts the salarian team to fire the EMP device. An electrical discharge takes place and the gun battery is disabled.
Kill the exalted krogan and the kett[]
Just like your regular krogan in a blood rage, only way more resistant to weapons and permanently enraged
In the previous room, the exalted krogan Behemoth is freed from its tank and comes at your team using the Archon's Chamber as its ""boss fight"" arena. Your squadmates bring up Drack if he isn't in the party, or Drack himself tries and fails to command his former subordinate. There's no way out of here but violence. Meanwhile Hayjer comms in to provide a status report, but Ryder tells him off as you're busy fighting.
The initial battle is just your team against the Behemoth. When its armor drops down to certain levels, waves of kett arrive to reinforce it: first is a group of 3 Chosen, then more Chosen and a Destined. You might be better off dealing with the standard kett first before the Behemoth, as the creature is a veritable damage sponge that occasionally heals itself while the reinforcements are not unlimited.
Note:  If you want to scan the Behemoth for Aid APEX, then it is strongly suggested to do so now. Depending on your upcoming decision in the aftermath of this fight, either this is the only Behemoth your Ryder will face, or you will have a few more opportunities to scan it further in the game.
When you've killed all the enemies, the chamber door is accessible again and a new navpoint appears. SAM nags you to escape the ship immediately, but there's no time pressure. Make sure you have no further business here before leaving.
Escape the kett ship[]
A long time ago in a galaxy far away Shepard was forced to make a similar decision on Virmire
You return to the previous area with the tanks and SAM discovers krogan life signs. They are scheduled for exaltation. Raeka is pinned down as well, she says over the comm. You only have time to save either the krogan scouts or the salarian Pathfinder.
You are now at a game-changing crossroads: Go back for Pathfinder Raeka, or continue on with liberating the krogan. One of the next two objectives below becomes the relevant next step of this walkthrough, and there are further repercussions in the aftermath of this mission. An autosave is generated once you arrive at the next area, which differs depending on your choice.
Rescue the captive salarians[]
Your squad arrives at Laboratory 19, outside a closed door. Raeka seems fine, but beyond the door is all-out kett resistance.
Considering Raeka's a Pathfinder it's kind of disappointing she has no flashy stunts or even better combat gear
Once the conversation is over the door automatically opens and Raeka charges ahead. A navpoint is added at the far end of the hallway and a large number of kett enemies arrive. Enemy composition is a bunch of Chosen, an Anointed, and some Destined initially. Later waves include more of the same and Wraiths. Don't worry about Raeka's health, she's invulnerable but deals crap damage anyway, so it's still up to you to finish the mission off quickly.
You will be fighting in two corridors going west, with Paarchero in view at the windows to the south, then to a large chamber. There are 2 ammo caches and 1 health cache in the corridors and zero scannables or lootable containers.
Why aren't the salarians hacking the door to free themselves? Are they stupid?
The large chamber is initially empty but fills up with enemies once you go in. It has an initial enemy composition of 3 Chosen, 2 Destined, 1 Anointed, and 1 Ascendant, the last one emerging from the cell of the salarian prisoners. Reinforcements arrive from the doors to the north, Destined and Anointed, so do not be blindsided when engaging the enemy. There is an ammo cache in the center of the room.
Once the kett are defeated, interact with a console at the navpoint to release the salarians and finish this portion of the mission. The final mission autosave is then generated.
Rescue the captive krogan[]
Your squad arrives at Laboratory 34, outside a closed door. A krogan named Birtak is waiting there who either talks to you or Drack if he's present. He managed to escape during the EMP attack, but the rest of the scouts are held beyond the door.
A random krogan you just met suddenly gets near-main character treatment
Once the conversation is over the door automatically opens and Birtak charges ahead. A navpoint is added at the far end of the hallway and a large number of kett enemies arrive. Enemy composition is a bunch of Chosen, an Anointed, and some Destined initially. Later waves include more of the same and Wraiths. Don't worry about Birtak's health, he's invulnerable but deals crap damage anyway, so it's still up to you to finish the mission off quickly.
You will be fighting through a very long corridor similar to Lab 16 earlier, only this time the main forward doors are open and there's no access to the side chambers. Window views to the north show the orbited gas giant but no salarian ark. First section has an ammo cache, second section has an ammo and health cache, third section has 2 ammo caches, and the fourth one has the scout holding cell as well as a health cache. There are no scannables or lootable containers throughout this level.
Why aren't the krogan bashing the windows to free themselves? Are they stupid?
The final section has an Ascendant outside the holding cell of the scouts, supported by a gaggle of Anointed, Destined, and Chosen. The doors to the final section are initially closed but automatically open on approach. The fight may be a bit more challenging since there is little room to maneuver whenever the Ascendant fires off its huge barrier-killing attack.
Once the kett are defeated, interact with a console at the navpoint to release the krogan and finish this portion of the mission. The final mission autosave is then generated."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/A_Better_Beginning,"Prerequisite: Nexus Reunion
This mission is acquired immediately after joining forces with the Nexus.","Speak with SAM on the Hyperion[]
Use the tram to return to the Habitation Deck of the Hyperion and head to the SAM Node. Activate the terminal in the SAM node to learn more about Pathfinder Ryder's connection to SAM and the modifications that Alec Ryder made to SAM to enhance his own abilities. The allies and relationships mission Ryder Family Secrets is automatically started, speak to SAM again to learn more.
Go to your ship[]

This objective is complete simply by going to the Nexus Docking Bay, but in the interests of efficiency the following actions can also be accomplished in the interim. (+270 XP for boarding the Tempest.)
Feel free to explore Alec's former quarters, now your own personal room, as SAM suggested. The first memory trigger for the recently started Allies and Relationships mission can be found here, as well as a model of the SSV Normandy SR-2. Access audio logs for insight into the Initiative and a few words from Liara T'Soni.
You can also make a quick stop at the Cryo Bay to check on your sibling and pick up a side mission, Task: Lost Brother.
When you finally enter the Tempest Ryder and Cora Harper enjoy a breathtaking view of the new ship.
Go to the bridge[]
Once the cutscene has ended, your next objective is to head to the bridge to begin the trip. Feel free to explore the ship a bit before heading out, though most of the crew is too busy readying the ship to talk to Ryder. Vetra Nyx, one of the Tempest's new crew, will help acquaint you with all the sections of the ship.
Note:  You should check in with all of the crew after each Priority Ops mission. Crew members will usually have new conversation options after the completion of a Priority Op mission.
Kallo Jath, the ship's pilot, meets you upon entering the bridge, and explain the navigational controls and make ready for departure from the Nexus. Ryder gives a short speech and Kallo will take the ship out.
Go to Eos in the Pytheas system[]
Use the Galaxy Map to travel to Eos in the Pytheas system.
Note:  Travelling to Eos is a good opportunity to familiarize with planet scanning and begin working towards completing Task: The Model of the Spheres. The systems of Pfeiffer and Eriksson are now available for scanning as well and are on the way to Eos.
Land on Eos[]
Landing on Eos will gain Ryder +2 AVP and +2% Eos viability.
Clear atmospheric radiation[]
Welcome to a promising start: a few supply caches, containers, and scannable items shortly after landing
Previous attempts to colonize Eos failed due to the high radiation levels. However, the crew recognizes a signal like that found on Habitat 7; if similar alien technology exists on Eos, Ryder may be able to use it to improve the planet's conditions and make it viable for settlement.
This is the overarching objective of the mission. All other objectives below are designed to accomplish this one.
Note: If you are familiar with the structuring of missions and assignments in the previous Mass Effect trilogy, this is the first major mission where you will notice that you can accomplish numerous other missions on- and offworld before this gets resolved. This is similar to Race Against Time or Stop the Collectors, except while those are overarching missions for the first two games A Better Beginning is only the overarching mission for a single planet. A key difference is while you won't return to the same mission levels twice in the previous games, here you have the entire Eos map to explore repeatedly, or gradually as more areas open up. You can leave the planet, go back to the Nexus or explore other systems, and resume the mission where you left it. The same philosophy applies to all other hub worlds further down the game. Thus, with a few exceptions, there is generally no rush to investigate everything in one go, but lootable or scannable items along the way that can be returned to later will be noted for efficiency's sake.
Pay attention to the building labels for loot navigation
If you take the time to walk around Site 1: Promise before dealing with the next objective, there are numerous items to scan that will yield a total of +160 and +20 (+10 each for scanning a fluorite node and a cadmium node for the first time). SAM helpfully encourages you to do it for research points once you bring up the scanner and it pings a valid object. The buildings have distinct labels on their walls to help with navigation and identification.
Just a few steps from your starting position, there's an ammo supply cache and a container. Looting the container will alert the squad there seems to be someone else in the area. Beside a nearby truck are two supply caches: ammo and health. The crate next to the health cache can also be scanned for +10. The building marked S2 cannot be opened for now; between it and the Tempest is another ammo supply cache and another lootable container.
Following the vehicle trail from your starting position, the yellow six-wheeled cAvro/Ute PackRack can be scanned for +10. The fallen cylinder beyond it is a damaged Husqani-M1 Adaptive Turbine (+10). On the rocks overlooking the site's small lake is a fluorite node. Further along the vehicle trail, east of the Tempest is another damaged power turbine (+10).
Nearby, outside the building labeled L1 is a container. Inside it is a datapad containing a door code and a terminal.
There's little point venturing beyond the masts at the moment; the broken shuttle can be scanned from the safe zone
The building labeled T3 west of the Tempest has a scannable door (+10) telling you there's no power. Between the T3 building and the F5 building is an Infusion Station (+10). South of the T3 building, near shield masts, are fluorite and cadmium nodes as well as a destroyed Forward Station (+10). On the other side of the anti-radiation field near the Forward Station, there's a shuttle torn in two (+10). You won't have to leave the field to scan that one.
The F5 building has two containers, a datapad with a door code, and another datapad containing Grace Lito's personal log.
There are two buildings labeled S2 in Site 1. One is marked as the research station in the map. North of the other S2 building is another Infusion Station (+10). East from the Infusion Station, at the base of a girthy rock formation is a fluorite node.
A shuttle parked behind the main building: someone else is around
The main building complex is also labeled N4. There are two working energy storages (+10 each) north and east of it. A few steps north from the building is a working shuttle(+10), presumably operated by someone who isn't supposed to be there. Beneath one energy storage is a scannable corpse that will give you Task: Naming the Dead.
The giant circular complex along the vehicle trail is a water filtration system displaced by the storms. There's nothing in its surroundings except shield masts and two fluorite nodes, but be warned that one of them lies in a level 3 radiation hazard zone that will deplete your life support rapidly.
Site 1: Promise is ringed by multiple shield masts. Beyond them is a radiation environmental hazard; venturing outside will gradually deplete your hardsuit's life support systems unless you turn back. Multiple sites on Eos also have these masts: scanning them the first time will yield some dialogue about their function but no points. Scanning subsequent masts will not yield anything even if the scanner marks them red.
Search Site 1's main control building[]
Reach the outpost central control on the objective marker northwest from the Tempest to complete this objective. It's on emergency power and it's locked, requiring a code to open.
Find a code to access locked buildings[]
If you haven't encountered the code yet, this sub-objective pops up. The objective marker will point you to the building labeled L1 as it has a datapad inside that has the code, although you can also search the building labeled F5 for a similar datapad. After retrieving either, you will be able to open the main control building's door.
Restore power at Site 1[]
Scan the board, loot the crates, access the terminals in the background
If you already have the code from searching the other buildings, upon opening the outer door you'll see two doors and a container inside. One of the doors is locked (also scannable, but won't yield points if you already scanned a similar door in the T3 building). Beyond the accessible door is a message terminal. Further in, you can scan the power interface for +10. There are two containers, an audio terminal (about a complaining Zed Wilcox), and a console, but your objective is accessing the console.
After using the console, the first step at Site 1: Promise is restoring power to the abandoned outpost so that a thorough scan of the area can be completed and the source of the atmospheric disturbance can be located. Ryder finds that there is a manual override at a nearby relay station that is preventing the power from coming online.
Investigate the power relay station[]
Promise's power relay station
Follow the objective marker to the power relay station on the southeastern ridge, beyond the Tempest.
Follow the vehicle trail east and on some rocks before the incline there's a fluorite and a cadmium node. The trail curves upward to the power station (also labeled T3 but this building's bigger than the other one); beside two crates there's an ammo cache. The power station's lower door yields +10 when scanned. The pipes on the downward slope are part of a Hydro-Evaluation Station (+10).
Beneath the stairs to the upper door there's a lootable container. Upon using the console beside the door on the second floor of the station, you will be ""greeted"" by Clancy Arquist, a salvager who has taken up temporary residence there. It appears that Clancy is responsible for the signs of recent illicit activity at Site 1. Clancy won't open the relay station doors just yet, but he agrees to let you turn on some of the generators to get the antenna online to locate the source of the Remnant signal. He warns, however, that doing so will attract the attention of kett patrols.
Activate the generators[]
You now need to activate the generators. Objective markers for two power pylons will appear: one southeast from the Tempest and one southwest from the Tempest. Either can be chosen at will.
Scan the power pylons to find an interface[]
No need to construct additional pylons
Attempting to activate the first power pylon will cause it to break down and temporarily cross out the previous objective. Scan the power pylon (+10) to determine another interface location.
Activate power pylons[]
Use the interface location information to activate the first power pylon. Repeat the scanning and activating process for the second power pylon. (+10)
Defeat the kett[]
Dynamic entry for standard kett patrols
Upon repairing the second pylon, two dropships will deliver 2-3 kett Chosen each, deploying beside the Tempest's nose. Deal with them.
Reactivate the power relay station[]
Return to Clancy and speak to him to get information about where to find a vehicle. After Clancy leaves, use the console at the back of the room to reactivate the power relay station (+73 AVP and +5% Eos viability).
Note: When you return to Clancy he can buy/sell items if you immediately ask if he trades. He won't be able to do so if you advise him to get to a safe location, although later he can be found next to the shuttle behind Site 1's main building as a merchant.
The room also has two lootable containers.
Scan containers to find a vehicle[]
Once power is restored, Ryder will be able to access the surrounding buildings. You only need to scan the large cargo container northeast of the Tempest to complete this objective, but since we're already here might as well explore.
The now-unlocked building S2 next to the cargo container is a Research Center. Investigate the Research Center to begin Task: Research Center Development.
Figurative ghosts in the machine
In some of the unlocked buildings, you can scan portions of recorded conversations from the former settler inhabitants. SAM is able to reconstruct the recorded conversations. In the small building marked T3 southeast from the Forward Station, there are two lootable containers as well as reconstructed images of Wilcox and Farthingale. In the big building also marked T3 south of the Tempest (first floor of power relay station) is a terminal, a container, a datapad that yields the mission The Secret Project, and reconstructed images of Wilcox and Farthingale. Scanning the reconstructed images awards +270 XP per conversation (+540 XP total).
Additionally, the formerly locked room in outpost central control has a container and a terminal containing Kay Farthingale's supply log.

Call down a forward station[]
Follow the objective marker to a large container with a small access panel. Scan the container to discover that it contains the ND1 Nomad, but must be opened with a code from a Forward Station. Approach the new objective marker and the Forward Station will automatically descend.
Note:  The first forward station on Eos doesn't give the usual award of AVP and viability. This was awarded when Ryder first landed on the planet. Subsequent forward stations on Eos will give the correct rewards except for the Forward Station on the vault island.
Unlock the Nomad container[]
The snazzy customizable pimpmobile you'll be using for the rest of the game
After SAM has automatically downloaded the access code, head back to the panel on the container to gain access to your new vehicle.
Get in the Nomad[]
Enter the Nomad to acquaint yourself with the controls of the vehicle.
Investigate strange signal[]
Follow the vehicle trail out of Site 1 toward the new objective marker west-southwest. You'll likely find some small hostile creatures while traveling to the objective, these can mostly be ignored and can be killed by driving over them with the Nomad. Just before entering the radiation shield on the north side of the road is a deposit of element zero.
Note: Enroute to the objective, You can pass a memory trigger which is part of the mission Ryder Family Secrets.
You will arrive at an unusual structure marked with a. Once past the radiation shield, you can exit the Nomad and roam about on foot.
Just left of the vehicle trail, there is a colonist corpse for Task: Naming the Dead. On the rocks nearby south, a platinum node (+10). Beyond the rocks, before the central platform are Initiative supplies with a small lootable container, plus health and ammo caches.
East from the central platform is a scourge tendril (+10). On a pile of rocks beyond the radiation shield northeast of the tendril is a fluorite node. West from the central platform, another Initiative shuttle (+10) implying someone else is around.
Lastly, before accessing the central console (""Alien Device"") marked in the objective the scattering of Remnant coolant tanks around can also be scanned (+10).
Search for a glyph to scan[]
It's not really required to scan the full picture, but properly visualizing where they lead can help
Attempting to interface with the console will introduce a key mechanic: you can use the scanner to follow hidden cables radiating from the console. In this case, there is only one cable, so follow the cable with the scanner. Alternatively, the objective marker clearly shows where you should be going anyway; it's just a matter of navigation.
Climb up the structure with the cable, then use Ryder's scanner to read a Remnant Glyph at the top. There are two Initiative monitors on top of the structure as well; scanning them will give +10 each.

Use the strange console[]
Once the glyph is scanned, you can return to the central console and interface with it to trigger a cutscene, where an asari comes out of nowhere and tackles Ryder to the ground, advising against rash actions. You can push her off or hear her out, either way before the proper introductions you'll have to fight some enemies.
Defeat the hostile bots[]
They hide, you seek
After the cutscene, the group is attacked by a group of Assemblers and an Observer. Deal with them.
After destroying the bots, the cutscene resumes where Ryder and the newcomer swap information about the Remnant. You now learn her name is Peebee, and she gives you her navpoints while she studies how you interfaced with the monolith.
After the cutscene, Peebee stays put there until you progress further into the mission. Until then, you can talk to her again for more information on herself and what she's doing on Eos. If you haven't scanned them yet, Observers yield +50 on first scan.
Activate Remnant monoliths[]
Next, you must travel in the Nomad to the two other monoliths - The southwestern and southern monoliths. Note:  The monolith visiting order is up to you, though this walkthrough has to start from somewhere: southwestern monolith first.
Southwestern monolith[]
Note: The road from the first monolith (northern) to the southwestern monolith will pass a forward station drop point. Stop for a moment to allow the forward station to drop before continuing. (+2 AVP and +2% Eos viability)
Remnant bots in their natural habitat
The Southwestern Monolith seems to have docile Remnant bots at first, though that's soon proven wrong on approach. You'll soon have about 4 Observers and 2 Assemblers to clear out.
The battlefield has two ammo and health caches around, plus several coolant containers, dischargeable supercapacitors and explosive materials (+10 each on first scan and deals damage to nearby enemies when destroyed). The two outer consoles in the central platform provide a quick tutorial on interfacing: they raise or lower nearby objects depending on configuration. These two control blast shields, though by the time you access them you'll likely have dealt with the bots already.
Other objects in the vicinity is a datapad with an audio log of the last doomed colonist there, plus another corpse for Task: Naming the Dead.
The objective marker points at the central console, though you also have to scan for two glyphs highlighted in the mission tracker. If you try to access the central console without scanning for the glyphs, a puzzle appears though it isn't solvable for the moment because it requires those glyphs.
Use the scanner to reveal two cables snaking out of the central console. Each cable will pass by another Remnant console. Interface with the console to raise several pillars and provide a method of reaching the glyph at the end of the cable. Near one of the glyphs at the top an unknown resonant device can also be scanned for +10. The pillars are also scannable, though they don't yield any points.
Once both glyphs are scanned (Accretion Glyph and Nihility Glyph), return to the central console and interface with it. This time, additional encryption will require you to solve a Sudoku-like puzzle in order to activate the monolith. For the puzzle solution, see here. If you found a Remnant Decryption Key, this special item may be used to bypass the puzzle. (+270 XP for completing the puzzle.)
More unwanted guests
As soon as Ryder activates the monolith, a squad composed of kett Anointed and Chosen will enter the scene from a dropship. Turns out those blast shield consoles may be good for something after all. Fight them off, then scan an Anointed corpse for +50 if this is your first time encountering the unit.
Drive out to the southern monolith when you're done with the place.
Southern monolith[]
As you may have noticed by now, the vehicle trail from Site 1 leads to the location of all monoliths. On approach to the southern monolith, it becomes apparent the kett have erected a compound around the structure. Peebee complains the kett squatted over her best research site, and warns the team they won't let it go without a fight.
This sub-objective is marked Kett Research Center and has two further sub-subobjectives: Clear the kett, and when that's done Find and disable the generator powering the shields to access the monolith. All three do not appear in the journal upon completion.
Time to storm the gates once again
The southern monolith is heavily guarded by these aliens. Battle through the initial wave of kett and two sets of dropship reinforcements. From the entrance, the walkway splits into left and right paths: it doesn't matter which way you take, they both converge at a presently shielded central area. Before going in, take note of a Kett Core Encryption Tech (+100) on the raised platform to the right, beyond the radiation shields.
The enemy consists of Chosen, Wraiths, and Anointed, who have home court advantage due to all the kinetic barriers and narrow walkways in the area. The barriers can be shut down through shooting or disabling nearby power generators, and keep an eye out for explosive canisters in case some enemy wanders close. Note:  Be mindful of your landing if you're jumping around in the walkways lest you suffer health and shield penalties from falling. Conversely, enemies can be disposed off in the same manner.
The walkways have four ammo caches, one lootable container in the center platform, one lootable container and an artifact crate (+10) in the left path. There are two Kett Core Encryption Tech (+100 each) in the right path. Several other kett equipment in the area are scannable, though they only inform you of their function and have no research points.
You can go to the monolith site and scan for glyphs, though you still have to bring down the central console's shielding to progress the mission
After the battle, you must disable or destroy the power generator noted by the objective marker. It shields both the central chamber and the monolith's central console. When the shields are down, a cutscene triggers in which Ryder meets Nakmor Drack, an old krogan with an apparent penchant for dramatic entrances. He soon leaves to hunt for more kett.
Be sure to check the whole base for other items not yet mentioned. In the immediate chamber, there are technology fragments on the floor (+10) and an artifact crate (+10), on the side of the left walkway. Beside the door to the right walkway, another artifact crate (+10) and a terminal with kett logs. The dead Wraith left by Drack on the floor can also be scanned, though it doesn't yield any research points. The inner chamber has a component box for Site 2's The Secret Project, a terminal with an audio log, and another body for Task: Naming the Dead.
On top of the central chamber there's a lootable container beside a power generator. Underneath the central chamber there are two lootable containers around a support column.
When you've had enough of the kett base, proceed to the monolith site. The area has a health and ammo cache each, a platinum node, and two toppled Nexus-issued scanners (+10 each).
As before, two more glyphs await Ryder. Follow the cables, scan the glyphs (Synaptic Glyph and Verdurous Glyph), then return to the central console. There is no puzzle at this monolith. Also, there is no enemy ambush after activating the monolith. (+270 XP, +73 AVP, and +5% Eos viability)
Investigate the entrance[]
The lights have shown me the way
When all three monoliths are activated, their beams now converge into a single location by the lake: a secret Remnant vault for Ryder to explore, containing the necessary machinery to revive the world. This is a common pattern on most other worlds further in the game.
Go back to the Nomad and follow the new navpoint toward the vault: an island in the lake marked with.
Note:  The road from the southern monolith to the Vault will pass another forward station drop point. Stop for a moment to allow the forward station to deploy before continuing. (+2 AVP  and +2% Eos viability)
It's difficult but not impossible to reach the island via jumpjet, but that won't raise the Vault from the ground so just activate the cool high tech bridge
Climb out of the Nomad and access a console near the shore, which will activate a bridge, raise the Vault entrance from the ground, and deactivate the monoliths' beams. You can cross to the island on foot or by vehicle, but you will need to walk into the Vault to continue. Be careful not to fall into the lake, you'll end up on the closest shore you dropped from.
Explore the Remnant vault[]
Peebee will be waiting for Ryder outside the vault, insistent on joining for the adventure. Once you open the door, you will be allowed to configure your loadout, then a cutscene immediately follows that sends the gang into the vault's mysterious depths. An interrupt is available that determines who goes first.
Once inside the vault, you cannot return to it later to collect missed resources. Take all wanted items as they become available. Keeping a save before opening the door is also advised, since while there are automatic saves there is no manual saving while in the vault.
Circuit boards and harmless pretty lights everywhere
After a long (but comfortable) drop down, Ryder and company arrive at a cavernous chamber. Peebee says to be thorough; doesn't hurt to follow her advice. Not even the kett appear to have reached where you are, so expect your team to be chatty on approach to interesting things.
In this first room you will find two loot containers and two Remnant Objects for +10 each. After a brief discussion, you will be able to scan the Data Pattern for +10. The ""wall"" to the south is also scannable and tells you it can function as a door, though it yields no points. If you consult your map, you'll find that the Eos overworld has been replaced for the time being with that of the immediate area, which will increase in coverage as you explore more and more of the vault.
When you've got all that, follow the objective marker to interface with the console.
Follow the conduit into the vault[]
Nothing obvious immediately happens, so SAM reports conduits filling up with ferrofluid. Turn on your scanner and you'll see pipes leading out of the room, past the door/wall to the south. It immediately opens on approach.
PROTIP: scan often and follow the ferrofluid road
Through the newly opened door, you will find another chamber with another wall/door at the end. You can scan that door (0 points), though on approach Ryder will be perplexed as to why it isn't working. Peebee suggests investigating the Data Patterns surrounding the inoperable console. Scanning any one of the patterns triggers another discussion; after scanning all three the next door will be unlocked.
The Data Patterns in the room award +10 each.
When you open the next door, another cutscene triggers. At this point, Peebee will decide to split up: Ryder fixes the vault; she'll investigate the relic. Task: Remnant Data Cores will be automatically given after the cutscene. Once the door closes behind you, it's permanently sealed shut.
Remember the chamber to the left when you return to this place later
You can scan the barrier around the power beam in the center of this new room for +10. It's impenetrable and a level 4 electrical hazard, so don't even try to walk through it. The door to the east will be locked and inaccessible the entire mission. The force field to the west is worth investigating. You cannot enter the room yet, so you'll order SAM to note the location on your map (See Bugs section). You will be only be able to access the room and container on the way out of the vault.
Head through the southern door to continue. In the next room, on the right is a container, and a Remnant console at the middle end of the platform. The console controls blast shields and nothing else.
Use the elevated pillars in the fluid to get across to the next platform with a mechanical arm. Scan the Mechanical Arm and the Unknown Ferrofluid for +10 each (+20 total). Note: Don't fall into the ferrofluid: level 3 electrical hazard.
On a cluster of pillars just next to the mechanical arm is an Adaptive Remnant Core Device (+100). Due northeast among the terraced steps, before passing the navpoint, is a container.
They're too deactivated to care
South from the pillars, there's a door. Open it and head into what appears to be a storage room. You'll be attacked by two hostile Assemblers. The remaining 3 Assemblers in the room will remain inactive.
After defeating the enemies, scan one of the Inactive Assemblers for +10 and loot the nearby container. Head back out when you're done.
Following the navpoint again across the deadly pool to the eastern side of room, there are several territorial Assemblers. Defeat them to roam the area freely. There are ammo and health caches to the east in case you run low.
They're generally docile unless approached (or shot from afar)
A container is located on the lower level of this area, below the Remnant console and beside a ferrofluid waterfall. The console does not control anything useful, only blast shields again.
To the south across some pillars, there is another container. There is also a locked door in this location; it can't be unlocked and the other side is empty anyway.
Further east, Ryder and the gang observe cyclopean Remnant machinery from the cliff all the way to the horizon, making them wonder what the place is really about. The ferrofluid falls off here, and there are two paths. To your left (north) ends in a door with a container inside. To your right (south) is the continuation of the conduit trail, another ammo cache, and a side door with another container.
The doors at the back don't do anything except enhance the aura of mystery in the vault
In the next room, there are five more hostile Assemblers. Deal with them. There's a health and an ammo cache along the cliff path south for emergencies.
The room has two doors along the wall with visual glyphs on their surfaces in an apparent interface. Don't be fooled: they're just set decoration, cannot be opened, and again empty anyway. Near the southwest door is a container though. There are also two consoles that are linked to each other: for controlling blast shields again.
After finishing with this room, proceed to the south into a corridor. There will be a brief interaction with Peebee who can be seen on a distant ledge to the east. Don't even try jumpjetting to her position, there's no point and it cannot be reached through normal means.
Sometimes exploring every reachable nook pays off
The conduit goes through a large door nearby. Before entering it, follow the ledge till you hit the dead end. Therein lies a container, in addition to a door that can be opened to reveal another container. Head back to the main door when you're done.
After going through the main door, Remnant Lights rise up from the floor. You can scan one of them, though they don't give any points.
The passage ends in another door. The final navpoint is in the next room; reaching it causes Ryder to surmise there's an inactive gravity well that can be turned back on.

Activate the gravity well[]
This room contains some Remnant forces, which you'll have to fight. Accessing the two consoles in the area will raise a gravity well, though you'll have to deal with the bots first.
Try hijacking the turret to the right of the entrance without alerting the bots
Note:  If you want to stack the odds further in your favor, before rushing headlong into battle, proceed up the ramp to the right (north ramp) without attracting the attention of the Remnant forces. The console there controls the nearby Remnant turret. Start by scanning the turret (+50), then interface with the nearby console to convert the turret into an ally, and then begin the battle.
There are two ammo caches in the area: one near the turret, and the other on the opposite side, near the other objective console that's also tied to a Remnant Shield Charger (scannable, but yields no research points). Enemy composition is Assemblers and Observers.
After beating the bots, the entrance to the chamber seals up and the only way out is forward. Before leaving, you can loot the container to the west, and scan the nearby inactive Observer (+10) to trigger a conversation about the nature of the bots.
After collecting all needed items in the room, activate the gravity well to reach the second level of the vault.
Follow the conduit farther into the vault[]
You arrive at yet another cavernous chamber in Floor 2, with a console on one side and a wall/door on the opposite side. Problem is, the console turns out to be leaking ferrofluid, so there's no power going to the door.
Repair the conduit flow[]
She can't fix it herself, though she gives you the means to do so
Peebee shouts out from an unreachable ledge, also complaining she can't access any doors. She sends you an omni-tool patch mimicking laser frequencies Observers use to fix things. You can now repair the console. Scanning the Ferrofluid Leak is optional, though it awards +10.
After fixing the leak, interface with the console to unlock the door. Peebee gains access to a Remnant bridge and speeds off on her own again. Before leaving the room, loot the two containers there; the one beside a Remnant light has a guaranteed Remnant Cryo-Gauntlet.
Note:  Fixing the conduit is the last autosave for a while. Try not to die if you don't want to lose items you'll be looting later.
Find a way through the caverns[]
Who needs sunlight when there's limitless energy all around
The giant door opens to a literally cavernous chamber, much of it chasms and some platforms like the one you're standing on. Immediately look to the left for an Adaptive Remnant Core Device (+100).
The gap between your platform and the next is impossible to cross unaided or even with jumpjets. Fortunately, the Remnant console on your starting platform can raise some pillars.
Use the pillars to reach the platform with the Unknown Plant and scan the plant for +10. There's a health cache here in case you need it. Interface with the nearby console on the platform to elevate pillars to the southwest, which simultaneously lowers the pillars to the starting platform.
Cross the pillars to the southwest platform, where after a few jumps up a couple of Observers plus four or five Assemblers show up to hassle the squad. There are two ammo caches here.
Jump scares? In my sci-fi? More likely than you think
After the battle, you can explore the nearby ledges for lootables. Southwest from the Unknown Plant platform, on the top ledge beside a Remnant light is a container. On the upper ledge next to the green-hued pit is another container.
Head through the door to the west into another Assembler maintenance bay (or your first, if you didn't explore the earlier one). The squad are nervous about the inactive machines; fortunately none of them go online and there's only a lootable container here. A sharp sound suddenly interrupts on your way out: false alarm, some machine part probably fell somewhere.
Mildly annoying alone, shield-strippers when in swarms
When you're out of the room, use the nearby console. This console will provide access to the northern section of the vault. Ryder thinks you should backtrack, so best follow your own advice. A trio of Observers pop up on your way though, so you'll have to deal with them first. There's a bunch of blast shields here you can crouch behind, though better move fast or they'll float and fire at your flank.
Head back to the tree platform and take the newly-accessible northern path to a new platform.
Follow the conduit to the source[]
On setting foot at the northern platform, this objective pops up. You can follow the objective marker immediately by interfacing with the western console to start a trail, though if you want to explore further ignore it for the moment. There's an ammo cache here if you need it. The locked door nearby cannot be opened by any means; pay it no attention.
Immediately jump up to a ledge to the north-east to access another container and another console. This console will open a path to the southern section.
They have the high ground
Go back to the tree platform and continue to the southern path. On the southern platform, a welcoming party of Observers and Assemblers greet your arrival. Take your time dealing with them; plenty of cover and fallback positions around.
After dealing with them, before going into the area with another tree there are three containers. One is just next to a blast shield. Another is up on the ledges, requiring climbing and jumpjets to reach. The last one is at the promontory overlooking the southwesternmost reaches of the map; one of your squadmates may have something to say here.
Now head back to the nearby tree-area that Ryder describes to be some sort of library. In this location, you will find six Data Patterns that can be scanned for +10 each (+60 total). This location also has two glyphs (Reflection Glyph and Nihility Glyph) to be scanned that allow access to the puzzle container. (This puzzle is required for the Cryptographer Achievement). For the puzzle solution, see here.
Once you've collected all of the items, jump back over to the first tree platform and onto the northern platform once more.
Only looting and dodging remain once they're gone
Interface with the western console (on the northern platform) to raise pillars to open a new pathway. Doing that, however, attracts the attention of another Observer trio plus an Assembler. Defeat them. The cover spots are near the bots, so shooting (or powers) from afar may be more prudent.
The pillars lead to another tree platform. Again it isn't possible to jump across to the final platform without using the console; Ryder confirms on approach to the edge. Interface with the console on this platform to activate a bridge.
Vaguely reminiscent of a certain massive stream of energy back in the Milky Way
Cross the bridge and loot from the container on the left before going through the main door to the north. The main door takes Ryder to the heart of the vault.
The giant energy beam cannot be scanned but an Adaptive Remnant Core Device to the right can (+100). The nearby Remnant Barrier can also be scanned, though it has no research points. There is also a nearby container and a health cache.
If, for some reason, you are compelled to go near the beam, don't. It's a level 4 electrical hazard.
Escape the vault[]
Once you've collected everything you need, and are ready to finish the mission, access the main console highlighted by the objective marker, and get ready to run. Activating the console starts a purification field that you must outrun. The final autosaves in the vault record here, and the Fusion Mod of Shielding is automatically awarded.
Pay attention to the rotating orange floor lights, they're there to guide you out of the vault
Simply have Ryder follow the objective marker to exit the vault, and always move forward. The purification field will always be behind you, but if you dawdle to take a look for a few seconds too long it will consume you along with everything else. Several obstacles can delay the escape: avoid the square (or diamond) floor vents, they'll spew hazards, and immediately use the first console you see to activate a bridge.
At the end of the path, behind a door is a gravity well. Use it and it will deposit you back to Level 1.
Quickly do the objective below, or ignore it. Whatever you decide, run for the door to the north afterward. Once you open it a long cutscene will trigger. Peebee barely makes it with some Observers on her heel, the final door to the surface won't budge, and Ryder has a desperate idea to interface with the nearby console, though the purification field recedes on its own. Vault restart complete, and you can choose how to react on the team's experiences in a conversation.
Afterward, SAM reports some interesting connections between the Remnant and the Heleus Cluster, and you have further opportunities to steer the conversation.
When Ryder exits the vault, +1330 XP, +1150 AVP, and +50% Eos viability are awarded. The skies are also clearer, thanks to superfast terraforming. Peebee confirms Ryder is her ticket to the Remnant and requests to join the team. She won't take no for an answer, and here's your new squad member.
Note:  A forward station is established on the vault island after the vault is activated, but unlike other forward stations, no additional AVP or planet viability is awarded. Peebee, although she just flew out of the area through her shuttle, can immediately be selected as a squadmate in the loadout section.
Optional: retrieve the unsealed item[]
Move reasonably fast enough and you can still loot the container to the right before going up in smoke
As soon as you return to Level 1, after using the gravity well, Ryder will comment that the force field from earlier in the mission is deactivated (the area will now be marked on the map with).
Quickly jump up the ledge to the west and loot the container for +142 XP and a large array of miscellanea, plus three guaranteed Remnant Cores.
To emphasize, you aren't required to complete this objective given the time constraints, though it's a trade-off between escaping alive or some valuable loot. It's merely a matter of your own dexterity if you can pull it off.
Establish an outpost at an appropriate site[]
Use the Nomad to travel to the objective location. If you activated the forward station near the southern monolith, you can use the forward station to fast travel very near to the site.
Is Uncle Nakmor a thing? Probably not
Upon approach, Ryder spots Drack in battle against a kett platoon. Drive over and exit the vehicle to help him fight the kett off: 4-6 Chosen initially deployed from two dropships, then joined by another dropship with Anointed and more Chosen after your arrival. Note:  Don't worry about Drack dying; he and the kett are invincible before you enter the fray.
When the dust has settled, Drack revises his opinion of Ryder after being impressed by the squad's combat abilities, and decides to join the crew.
After talking to Drack, interact with the outpost beacon to initiate the settlement procedure. Ryder will be faced with an important decision about the nature of the new outpost: should it have a scientific or a military focus? Warning:  You do not make the decision for each individual outpost further down the game, only this one. Whatever you choose will become the focus of all future outposts.  Either decision will please some and upset others.
Mayor and Director of Colonial Affairs en route
Once you decide, shuttles begin bringing colonists down to the surface, and many prefab buildings are deployed. August Bradley is assigned as the mayor of the new settlement, which the inhabitants call Prodromos.
Foster Addison promptly takes Ryder aside to discuss the situation. After a few ambiguous compliments and reprimands (where you can steer the conversation twice according to your opinions on her), she departs for the Nexus, leaving you overlooking the home you've just made possible.
Feel free to head down to explore and socialize. From this point forward, The Tempest now parks in Prodromos instead of Site 1 when revisiting the planet. When you're ready, return to your ship.
Setting up the outpost will award +300 AVP  and +10% Eos viability. The mission AVP Cryo Deployment Perks also becomes available after the talk with Addison.
Speak with Tann at the Nexus Pathfinder HQ[]
On the Tempest, after a quick introductory meeting for the Pathfinder team's two new members, you will have free reign of the ship. Take the opportunity to get to know the crew, who are no longer too busy to talk. Use the email terminal to pick up some side missions.
When you're ready, use the Galaxy Map to travel back to the Nexus, greet the crowd headed by Professor Herik and Lieutenant Sajax, then take a tram from the Docking Bay to Operations.
Enter the door to the Pathfinder HQ to discover that it has been transformed from a storage closet into a large office and meeting room.
Three heads of the Nexus about to bicker again
Tann initially meets with and congratulates Ryder alone. Whatever your opinions on him, he will reframe it in a way that paints him in a conciliatory light. He then explains the Pathfinder HQ's purpose to you before Tiran Kandros and Nakmor Kesh, his ""staff"", arrive (although they both prefer ""colleagues"").
The next topic of the conversation revolves around your choice of focus for Prodromos: Kandros raises concerns if you opted for the scientific outpost, and Kesh raises concerns if you opted for the military one. Either way Tann will send you out to continue along the lead discovered in the first vault.
Finishing the meeting will complete this mission despite the objective below. The next Priority Op, A Trail of Hope I, is also automatically awarded.
Give Eos radiation time to clear[]
Even though the skies are clear above Eos, many areas are still inaccessible due to lethal radiation levels. It is recommended that you return once the radiation has cleared.
The radiation will be gone after your first visit to Aya during A Trail of Hope I. Just go to Aya directly after ""A Better Beginning"" has completed, and then return to Eos."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Meet_the_Resistance,"Prerequisite: A Trail of Hope I
This mission is acquired as part of the aforementioned mission on the Tempest.","This mission is a Heleus Assignment if Helping Havarl's Scientists is completed before this mission. Alternatively, this is a Priority Op if Helping Havarl's Scientists is completed after this mission. As this is the formal start of a 6-mission chain, the next 2 missions will inherit its mission type while the last 3 missions are firmly optional Heleus Assignments.
The objective labels for this mission also change depending on its mission type.
Priority Op
Travel to Voeld
Speak to Commander Do Xeel
Speak to the lookouts


Heleus Assignment
Aid the angarans on Voeld
Locate the Resistance commander
Speak to Resistance lookout
The substance of the mission doesn't change. The only changes are whether or not you already know the personnel on Voeld. The walkthrough below is structured to you going to Voeld first (Ryder doesn't know the personnel).
Of the two options that the mission text suggests - Voeld or Havarl - Havarl can be done much faster. The Resistance will generally act friendlier to you if you already helped on Havarl as your exploits have reached their ears, else this is your chance to prove your intentions.
Travel to Voeld[]
Voeld is in the Nol system on the Galaxy Map.
Speak to Commander Do Xeel[]
This article or section is a stub. You can help Mass Effect Wiki by  expanding it.
Land on Voeld - the intended Habitat 6. The temperature is below -52°C (-62°F). This is a Level 2 Cold Hazard so you will need to run to the Angaran Resistance Base to get to safe temperatures before your life support is depleted.
The first solar heater encountered on Voeld
Look out for an iridium node left of the path. After a while you'll reach a Solar Heater. Standing close to these heaters recharges life support. Heaters are placed all over Voeld.
Inside the base, the temperature is -30°C (-22°F), and this temperature is considered as safe. Ryder's life support won't deplete. Forward Stations also provide safe zones.
To make life support last longer, it is advised to use the consumable Backup Life Support.
At the start of the base, there are several Resistance Cruisers that can be scanned for +10 . Between the two cruisers on the left, next to some angara, there is a small crate with two Isharay rifles. The rifles can be scanned for +10 .
Talking to Commander Anjik Do Xeel is mandatory on your first visit to Voeld; you get an inescapable cutscene conversation upon arriving at her vicinity inside the base. Asking about the front lines will give you an option to find recruits for the Resistance, though this is not followed by the Journal and no option is given to actually follow up on this request.
Note: It is difficult but not impossible to traverse Voeld on foot, bypassing the Resistance base by braving the level 2 hazard from the Tempest directly into the valley eastward, keeping a supply of Backup Life Support, and heading for the nearest solar heaters at any chance. However, activating the Forward Station sites for the rest of the map (and thus obtaining access to fast travel and the Nomad) requires activating the Resistance base forward station first, which requires meeting with Commander Anjik at the very least.
Before leaving to find the lookouts, you can pick up three other missions: Intercepted, Medical Caches, and Task: Nomad Shield Crafting.
Speak to the lookouts[]
Beniska and Tseek standing guard over a sweeping snowscape
Outside the base, talk to Beniska and Tseek. After the conversation, this mission completes, and On the Frontlines/Eyes on the Ground is automatically received. The nearby Forward Station is also activated, if you haven't ventured off earlier."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Helping_Havarl%27s_Scientists,"Prerequisite: A Trail of Hope I
This mission is acquired after initiating official first contact with the angara on Aya.
This mission is a Heleus Assignment if Meet the Resistance is completed before this mission.
This mission is a Priority Op if Meet the Resistance is completed after this mission.","Travel to Havarl[]
Go to Havarl on the Galaxy Map. You'll arrive in the outskirts southwest of Pelaav Research Station, and this is your landing zone on the world in subsequent visits.
Make contact with the scientists at Pelaav[]
Arrival on Havarl
Move straight ahead across the broken bridge to Pelaav Research Station. Inside the main building, talk to Kiiran Dals. She reveals that the research team is currently caught in what seems to be a Remnant stasis field, alive but unresponsive, and directs you to a Remnant monolith. Next to Kiiran, there is an Ionic Cleaning Chamber that can be scanned for +10 .
Before you leave can talk to Raashel Vier nearby to obtain Forgotten Stars (initial dialogue with her changes whether you talk to her before or after doing this mission). There is also a lootable mineral cache in the small room with Luj Ansen.
Help the researchers who are trapped at the monolith[]
The building might be decrepit, but the bots are as mobile and deadly as ever
Head to the objective marker on the nearby monolith which is located to the south of the Central Wilds region. As with most of Havarl, the base of the monolith is overrun by plant growth. There are a few Remnant patrolling the site, and you need to dispose of them to reach the scientists safely.
Enemy composition is basic Observers, Assemblers, any Breachers that may be fabricated, plus two Nullifiers emerging from the far end. There's a dischargable supercapacitor along the path of Remnant bots going forward to your team; you can make it explode so they also take damage.
There are two pairs of health and ammo supply caches here; one pair out in front and the other out in the back, beside a door. Hold off from sweeping the area for loot for now; that can be done later before exiting the monolith.
At back of the building beyond said door, you will find three angaran researchers frozen as Kiiran Dals said. Scanning them reveals their physiological state, but doesn't yield any points. Before they can be released, you need to find two glyphs (Magnitude and Verdurous Glyphs): one on the side of the block to the right of the console, and the other on a pillar to the northwest of the console.
Now if only we can use this kind of stasis against enemies...
Once you have the glyphs, solving the puzzle will lead to a short cutscene. For the puzzle solution, see below.
Assistant Torvar resumes his scanning activities like he was never put in stasis in the first place, only to be surprised by the appearance of strangers in front of him. If Jaal Ama Darav is in the squad Torvar is more likely to believe his team was frozen; otherwise he's suspicious of the aliens and plans to report their presence to Pelaav. Either way, the angaran researchers will return to the research station.
Item sweeping can be done before leaving the monolith for efficiency's sake. In the chamber formerly holding the angara, there is an Adaptive Remnant Core Device on the console platform which can be scanned for +100 . You can scan the giant mushrooms and bioluminescent fungi, but they don't yield any points. There's a small container in the corner space due southwest, next to a glowing plant. Due southeast is another health/ammo supply cache pair. Also southeast, hidden behind the Remnant column with the Verdurous glyph, is another small container. Due east from the platform is a nickel node.
Back in the entrance ""courtyard"", below the ramps are another small container and another nickel node. On the rocks at the same side as the health cache is an ingredient for Task: Better Crafting as well as another nickel node. Lastly, due west from the entrance is a platinum node, on rocks next to a giant mushroom and a glowing plant.
Return to Kiiran Dals[]
Two of the three rescued scientists aren't using the stasis excuse to get drunk
Back on Pelaav Research Station, you find the rescued scientists have made it back, though they're feeling some mild aftereffects. One of them, Assistant Torvar, reports having seen turians on Havarl (if you already discovered the Turian Camp and spoke to Avitus Rix before, this intro will be skipped), and later he suggests you look into the monoliths on Havarl to stop the world's decline.
Because you came through with the mission, Kiiran wants to apologize for her indifferent demeanor earlier. Jaal wants you to contact Evfra de Tershaav from the Tempest, figuring that helping the research station would allow the Resistance leader to place more trust in you."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Nexus_Reunion,"Prerequisite: Planetside
This mission is acquired immediately upon completion of the previous one.","The approach of the Hyperion to the Nexus is quiet and uneventful. Pathfinder Ryder and the Pathfinder crew remark on the lack of assembly progress that the Nexus has completed but remain enthusiastic about the official welcome home since their eventful arrival in the Heleus Cluster.
Travel to the Nexus via tram[]
Head to the tram console and activate it to begin your first tour of the interior of the Nexus.
Locate Nexus personnel[]
Guys you can come out now
Sadly there is no welcoming party to receive the Pathfinder crew. You begin in the tram entrance to the Common Area of the Nexus, though it's labeled Unknown Area at the moment. Beyond the door is an atrium which is in disarray with empty hydroponic tanks and equipment strewn about, with not a living being in sight. Everything seems to be on standby, with barely enough illumination as it is.
Multiple items here can be scanned, although these do not reward research points. To the right from the entrance there's a small lootable container among the big scannable containers.
Optional: Speak with Avina[]
The virtual intelligence, Avina, stands alone in the darkness and can give basic information but does not answer the most pressing question of the Pathfinder crew.
Speak with the construction worker[]
A construction worker too busy to notice the incoming saviors of the Nexus
The area is bounded by large boxes so you won't have to wander to find someone. Illuminated by a worklight not that far from the entrance there's a lone technician conducting repair work on a panel, too busy to notice you or your squad. Speak with the construction worker to learn that they thought the Hyperion crew was dead, feared lost in dark space, or captured.
While conversing with the construction worker, Tiran Kandros, the head of security, approaches and updates the group on the situation. The Nexus was badly damaged upon arrival in the Heleus Cluster in an event eerily similar to the Hyperion's arrival above Habitat 7, caused by what they refer to as the Scourge. The resulting situation deteriorated into a lack of life support for those onboard the Nexus, culminating in a mutiny and eventual exile of the rebellious force. Those remaining on the Nexus had lost hope that any arks would arrive, hence their surprise at the Hyperion's arrival.
Accompany Kandros to Nexus Operations via tram[]
The Nexus leaders can't even afford to turn the lights on for the newcomers
Kandros escorts Ryder's team to the bridge in Operations where the Nexus crew busily prepares to receive the essential power and resources from the Hyperion. You'll meet the rest of the Nexus leadership here, or what's left of them: Jarun Tann, Foster Addison, and Nakmor Kesh. The first two initially doubt your Pathfinding skills but are willing to give you a chance to prove it, while Kesh is supportive since your ark's arrival keeps the lights on.
At the conclusion of the cutscene, you can explore the Nexus solo. Your team is off attending to other matters at the moment: Liam Kosta sees to security concerns while Cora Harper goes with Tann to discuss giving you a scout ship. First Murderer and Station Sabotage may now be started and the Task: Getting to Know the Nexus is immediately started at this point as well. With a little planning, these three can be done in parallel to minimize the number of back and forth trips to various areas on the Hyperion and the Nexus.
Speak with Director Tann in Pathfinder Headquarters[]
The Mass Effect experience isn't complete without arrangements for a personal spaceship
Head to Jarun Tann's office which is located just below and south of the bridge. Upon opening the door, a cutscene will occur where Tann explains Ryder's first task as Pathfinder. You must go to the nearby planet Eos and figure out how to establish an outpost so the Initiative can gain a foothold and begin obtaining the resources it needs to start colonizing the galaxy.
Tann also explains that the alien race you encountered on Habitat 7 is known as the kett; they have been classified as a race hostile to the Initiative's goals and should be avoided. The conversation is interrupted by SAM who requests that you meet him aboard the Hyperion to discuss a sensitive matter. Tann concludes the chat by ordering you to report to the assigned scouting vessel and prepare to depart for Eos.
The mission is completed and the next Priority Op begins. Additionally, the Allies and Relationships mission Missing Arks is automatically started."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Planetside,"Prerequisite: Prologue: Hyperion
This mission starts automatically after the completion of the previous one.","Thanks to SAM fixing your malfunctioning jump-jets at the last minute, you manage to hit the top of a hill without being pulped. It's still a rough landing though, and you tumble down the slope and crack the visor on your helmet; fortunately your omni-tool can fix it.
The autosave for this mission begins in the aforementioned sequence. There is no manual saving anywhere in this Priority Op, so you'll have to rely on the autosaves that come up at certain points. When you stand up, the camera pans out allowing you to appreciate the strange prettiness of the place. Liam Kosta comes up and informs you comms are down, so your next course of action is to look for the others.
Welcome to your first outdoors mission in Andromeda. This mission serves as a movement and navigation tutorial and it will also teach the basics of combat further down the line. A lot of Codex entries are also bootstrapped here, so consult the guide if you want to check if you miss anything.
Note: If you imported a previous playthrough, all cryopod perks are disabled and you'll have to research them again further in the game. The inventory item limit resets back to 100, but you retain all previous items. If you are over the limit, this will prevent you from taking in additional weapons, weapon mods, and armor unless you deconstruct some of them. Your melee weapon also reverts back to an Omni-blade X. You start the game equipped only with the M-3 Predator regardless of previous playthrough's loadout, and you will get a few other basic weapons further in the mission, but you won't be able to use your more advanced gear.
Locate other members of the Pathfinder team[]
Note: Be wary of potential dialogue overlap. Ryder and Liam have a lot to talk about once they get their bearings and most of the time throughout the mission, so it's advisable to wait a few moments to ensure they have nothing else to say. Skipping over dialogue may even prevent triggering of optional objectives or Codex entries. There are a lot of fires strewn about; it should go without saying, but avoid crossing them as they will damage your shields/barriers then health fast.
This objective is fairly straightforward: find your teammates by following the navpoint. It is marked complete once you've accounted for the other team via comms. There are a number of optional objectives along the way, though, and while it is advised to do them all, it's still entirely your prerogative.
Just what sort of ""golden"" world did the Initiative send you to
One of the first things you can do here is scan the yellow glowing ""plants"" on the ground (+10). Without SAM around, identiying anything on the scanner is impossible, so non-Initiative items are labeled ""unknown"" for now. Nevertheless, just keep on cataloguing things.
A short distance from the plants the reason SAM's offline becomes apparent. If examined, the QEC relay (+10) from the shuttle is revealed to be permanently damaged. The shuttle debris next to it (+10) is supposed to be your supplies, but they're useless now. Nearby, the giant mushroom-like lifeform is also scannable (+10).
If you consult the map, everything is obscured at first and the area is slowly revealed as you explore. For now, just head east.
The path eventually becomes riddled by multiple lightning strikes. There are a lot of floating rocks in the path, but look for smaller rocks rising from the ground; avoid them as the bolts will hit those spots a few seconds later. Stay close to the mountain wall as much as possible until you reach the cave further east.
We require more vespene gas
Upon exiting the cave, you may notice weird animal noises coming from above. Two creatures are flying in a wide circle, causing Ryder to remark Cora Harper will appreciate the sight.
Optional: Test your weapon on a damaged fuel cell[]
Note: Scan the Fuel Cell for +10 BEFORE shooting the Fuel Cell (marked with). This optional objective may not appear if you imported a previous playthrough.
About a dozen meters after an ammo supply cache (), there is a small cave to the left with more giant mushrooms and a large orange glowing crystal emitting large amounts of strange energy. Scan the Crevice for +10.
Leave the small cave and head back towards the navpoint. There will be multiple gaps to jump and cliffs to climb to reach the navpoint, while Liam summarizes his backstory. When you reach the destination, a cutscene will start.
Protect Fisher[]
#MilkyWayLivesMatter
Ryder and Liam notice a large monolith with a blue cloud billowing to the sky, and you can take it as a threat or a mystery to be solved. Nearby they spot crewmember David Fisher who is pinned down by two Andromeda natives toting guns. You can make a conscious choice to go in flashing weapons or unarmed, but regardless, first contact with the aliens turns violent. One of them starts beating up on Fisher, and if you choose not to do anything, Liam forces the confrontation.
Neutralizing the aliens awards +113 XP. Dialogue is mutable depending on your chosen stance.
Fisher is unable to walk but lets you know that Lucas Greer and Dusty Kirkland went ahead looking for help. Ryder and Kosta leave him behind.
Optional: Scan the dead alien bodies[]
Scan an Unknown Alien (dead body) for +50 to complete this objective. You'll learn something about their physiology, but without SAM the data is limited.
Optional: Search the shuttle wreckage for supplies[]
Nearby is a lootable container. Open the container and take the guaranteed three Shield Capacitors and two Incendiary Ammo consumables to complete this objective.
Restock from a nearby ammo cache if needed. Close by is a health supply cache (), which this far into the game is the only way to heal Ryder. If you later return to these supply caches, you'll find that they have refilled.
Left side goes northwest, right side goes north
Up ahead the path diverges to the northwest and the north. Both paths have their own sub-objectives to fulfill, though you can easily accomplish one after the other and you can eventually circle back to Fisher regardless of the path.
Whichever path you pick first, you will encounter a huge alien structure built into the mountain on the right side, several hostile aliens, and Dusty Kirkland (this means the other path will not have Kirkland). They shoot him dead even while he's surrendering and you're unable to save him in time, giving you the impetus to defeat the aliens (+20XP). Further ahead on either path you will have an encounter with a biologically cloaking hostile animal. Scanning it the first time yields +50.
Note: For the purposes of this walkthrough, the northwest path is taken first.
Optional: Check on Kirkland[]
Inspecting Kirkland's body will start a cutscene. After the cutscene, an M-8 Avenger assault rifle is awarded and a new optional objective is added.
If you choose to pass over this optional objective, you can still obtain the Avenger later in the mission.
Optional: Locate Greer[]
Scanning either alien structure's door awards +10 and the revelation that these structures are only 3-4 centuries old; they weren't present when the Initiative departed the Milky Way 600 years earlier. Both also have nearby ""lamps"" can also be scanned, but their incomprehensible composition unnerves Ryder. These lamps can be scanned over and over again, but never yield anything.
Northwest Path
The northwest path from Fisher leads to a working Atmospheric Analyzer indicating the planet's atmosphere is not suitable to human life, nor has it been polluted or irradiated by its inhabitants.
You won't be able to enter these structures, but you will get to explore others later
Go further north until you reach a huge alien structure built into the mountain on the right side. There are four aliens guarding the structure, plus Kirkland if you picked this path first. For what it's worth, the left side gives you high ground advantage.
There is a small container in the lower ground, next to a boulder opposite the alien door. On a rocky surface next to the door and before a fire is another small container. There are also three devices nearby (+10 each), more rounded than the angular machinelike structures, although their function is unknown for now.
Further west to northwest, the path splits left or right around a large rock column but both lead to the same area: the Shuttle Beta Aft Section wreckage.
Too obvious place for an ambush
You find the wreckage of the back of the shuttle strewn about the large open (lightning-prone) area. Once you venture close to the shuttle, enemy units pop up in ambush. Three additional enemies arrive when you've cleared the initial wave. Taking them all out nets +20XP. Note:  The enemy contingent has a quadruped cloaking animal. Dialogue slightly changes depending on whether you encountered this yet in the north path.
There are three lootable containers in this area (two are in the fire-filled ditch). Listen to the flight recorder, which is hidden inside a crate. There is also a health cache and an ammo cache near the shuttle.
North-northwest from the wreckage there appears to be an explorable alien building. A new objective may be added depending on your proximity, but ignore it for now as Greer is closer nearby.
Head east of the alien building and go down the path under a 'wing' of some strange alien structure. Liam notices a path on the right, and he's right: there's a cave. Near the cave entrance, Ryder observes a pattern being transmitted in radio static. A Search Zone indicator then appears when you get close: an overhead HUD that displays signal strength that increases the nearer you get to the target.
I'll just be here chillin while you slaughter these uglies
Inside the cave is Greer, held at gunpoint by two aliens and desperate for help. Eliminate the enemies (+20XP) and save Greer. Take care as there is Hazard Level 2 Toxic Damage green ooze on the floor of the cave. He pledges to find his way back to Fisher after your rescue.
Once you're done, time to backtrack to the alien ruins to the west.
Optional: Investigate the alien ruins[]
Outside the ruins there are three scannable types of tech (+10 each) - two of them are lightning rods and one of those is broken.
Looks architecturally distinctive from the other ruins
Before you enter through the door, jump up to the dark second floor, where you'll find a small lootable container and corpses of the hostile aliens. Scanning them reveals they were fried by lightning, which they should've been prepared to deal with, leading Ryder to speculate they're not native to Habitat 7. Head back down and into the building.
It's dark inside and your automatic suit lights are barely sufficient, so you'll want to turn on the facility's lights. There's nobody home, and Liam also observes the architectural style is markedly different. When Ryder passes through the antechamber into the main room, you'll notice a sealed door on the right. Another optional objective is added, but first inspect and loot the place.
The main room has three small containers and an ammo cache. Next to one container is a scannable object (+10) that Ryder dubs ""weird alien machine"" for lack of anything else to call it.
To the right of the weird alien machine is a small ramp, and attached to the wall on the other end is ""another weird alien machine"" (+10). The adjoining room, also accessible from the main room by jumping, has five alien devices (four are scannable for +10 each) that may elicit reactions from Liam and Ryder. On a table is apparently an audio recording of the aliens in their incomprehensible tongue.
Optional: Find a way to access the sealed room[]
Four of the five devices do nothing when touched while the rectangular one with many wires at the center of the room ominously powers up... and turns out to be a generator, switching the lights on in the facility and opening the sealed room near the entrance. You can interact with the other four devices again, which also do basically nothing. Except for the large one near the audio log: that turns out to sound an alarm briefly, though nobody comes in.
Two treasure boxes? Or the answer to life itself beyond the door?
After this, return to the previously sealed door which leads into a small room which ends in front of a glowing door. There are two large containers by the entrance as well as another alien audio log that doesn't sound like poetry.
After a few steps forward, Ryder and Liam hear robotic warbling and come to the conclusion the hostile aliens were attempting to tunnel through the door. The sub-objective is marked finished at this juncture, but there are still things to do. There are five scannable items here: a door (+10), an apparently inactive robot (+50), a dead alien, a console next to the alien (+10), and a piece of tech (+10).
If you approach further, or scan any of these, the robot wakes up and turns hostile. Destroy it, and Liam namedrops the geth afterward. Ryder's comments slightly change depending on whether you kill the robot first before scanning the piece of tech or vice versa.
The aliens haven't been able to break through the big door, and neither will you, so if you've looted everthing you need you can exit the building. After opening the room's smaller entrance (which closed earlier), Ryder concludes there's machinery buried under the planet the hostile aliens are interested in, like bloodthirsty archaeologists.
Outside, an ambush will be waiting for you: two cloaking beasts and two gun-toting goons. Kill the enemies (+20XP). They've got one of the lightning rods up and running, and you can scan it again if you haven't earlier (+10).
Both northwest and northern path from Fisher's location eventually merge to form a large circular route. Northeast from the alien ruins, you will arrive at a juncture for three locations marked on your map: another alien building, a mysterious cave, or a debris field.
The closest one is the alien building, which is just a gatehouse with a tunnel door and has a foot patrol of four enemy units. There's an ammo cache and a t-shaped device (+10) beside the building. Turns out the building can't be entered from this side, though: might as well, as Liam insists you're not equipped for whatever's on the other side. If you're really curious, proceed southeast along the wall until you see an opening you can jump to. You will see a shielded base of some kind, and at this point can't do anything to proceed further. The coast is clear for now, and Liam reiterates getting out of there quickly. You can't jump back up easily if you dropped down, so again proceed along the rock wall until you see the other side of the tunnel door. Activate the two consoles to open the one-way doors, and you'll end up back outside. You will be returning to this later.
Optional: Investigate the crashed alien ship[]
The weather takes no sides
Southeast from the enemy building, there is a debris field guarded by multiple two-legged and four-legged aliens that will attack on sight. Simple proximity to the site will trigger this objective. Kill them (+20XP).
The battlefield is once again an open lightning-prone area, with numerous boxes available for cover. There's an ammo cache in case of need.
There are 5 unique scannable objects here. The multiple phallic light sources can be encountered on other sites, though no less scannable for RD if not yet catalogued. The crashed ship and four pieces of debris can all be scanned for +10 each, also reinforcing the idea the aliens aren't from Habitat 7.
It appears that the aliens were bringing in supplies from off-world. To complete this optional objective, examine the container next to the crashed ship.
Optional: Explore the cave[]
The calm amid the storm
Proximity to the cave system's contents will trigger this sub-objective.
Inside the mysterious cave is an Unknown Plant and an Unknown Lifeform that can be scanned for +10 each. The cave is a micro-biome where the native species of Habitat 7 have survived while the rest of the planet has gone to ruin. The dead animal appears to have been caught recently, speculated by Ryder and Liam to be a food source for the hostiles. You only need to scan the plant to complete this objective.
Northern Path
Loot box to the lower right, small cave entrance in the upper right center background
South of the cave and ship debris is a large chasm populated by narrow (and often interlocked) hexagonal platforms. You'll have to make liberal use of jump-jets to keep from plummeting. There is a distinct machinelike humming emanating from the depths, causing Ryder to joke they're from underworld alien gods. If you venture at a nearby cliff, Ryder may even note it's a good way to break the neck.
This area has exactly one lootable container. There are two examples of scannable items, though you will likely have encountered those on other sites already.
On the southwest portion of the chasm, hugging the narrow cliff, is a small cave. Creep inside slowly; there's a floating robot here that can be scanned for +50. If it detects you, it flies away, and it will fly away on approach. What's left are two large containers.
You're back close enough to where you started first contact
Backtrack from the cave and follow the cliff wall. Along this path, Liam will hear a predatory growl. It's one of those aggressive four-legged animals that can cloak, and you can scan it dead or alive (if you wandered here first before resuming the northwest path from Fisher - people may sometimes take the north path, see the chasm, then turn back and take the northwest instead).
Further south, you eventually arrive at Fisher's location - you have circumnavigated the region, and there's nothing else left but to head to the other team's shuttle.
Optional: Investigate the flares[]
This objective appears once you've progressed a considerable distance in either northwest or north path from Fisher. Three flares light up the sky at set intervals. Note:  These flares are continuously sent up: another batch appears as soon as the previous one falls out of sight.
Once you reach a close enough distance at whichever direction, Ryder will hear choppy comms from Cora, who reports repairs on their shuttle are underway but they're surrounded by hostiles. The sub-objective is then marked finished.
Locate the second shuttle[]
Head north to the second shuttle.
You'll get here eventually; what matters is if you have already explored and looted everything of importance before reaching Cora and the others. This is because the storms are worsening and the game will prevent you from backtracking once you wade in on their position via enforced mission boundaries.
This is a point of no return. Most of the prior optional missions not yet completed will be marked as failed afterward (the mysterious cave lies within the boundary, so later you can backstep this far). Once you're fully sure you have nothing else to do, proceed.
Defend the Pathfinder team from hostile aliens[]
Let the others cower behind barricades; real heroes are always in the thick of it
As you approach the area, Cora and two other crew members Hayes and Dr. Harry Carlyle are trapped by the aliens. You and Liam will have to save the day while the others lay down covering fire. Defeat all of the enemies. (+904 XP).
There are plenty of large rocks to take refuge in here. Whether you favor an in-your-face approach or cover-based shooting style, the area is spacious enough and well-suited for practicing any of your preferred styles of warfare.
After the battle, Cora announces that the team almost has their shuttle repaired and there is additional weaponry there if you want it. Pathfinder Alec Ryder has left to scout ahead.
Optional: Collect ammo and additional weapons[]
When you reach the ammo cache in the area, this objective is added. Quickly interface with the Weapons Cache or the opportunity to get extra weapons is lost. The weapon depends on your starting class: M-23 Katana for Scrappers and Leaders, Charger for Securities and Biotics, and Viper for Technicians and Operatives. If you didn't check on Kirkland's body earlier, there's also an Avenger rifle in the cache.
There are two ammo caches and a health cache in the area, as well as a large lootable container east from the shuttle.
PROTIP: shoot at them while they're still deploying
A short while later whether you rearm or not, the enemy resumes their assault. This next battle consists of two shuttle airdrop waves (the first gets zapped by lightning after deploying). First wave is just footsoldiers and cloaking beasts while the second wave introduces a heavy alien with shielding. Careful where you step, the riverbed between your team and the aliens' drop zone is a level 2 toxic hazard.
When the last adversary falls, Cora inquires about your shuttlemates and the answer depends on whether you found Greer. She shortly reveals her biotic powers by saving Hayes and Dr. Carlyle from a lightning strike. Communications are re-established and Alec Ryder contacts the group to inform them of his plan to stop the storm which is preventing them from departing in the repaired shuttle. In the middle of explaining the plan, Alec is interrupted by an unseen enemy force. Cora announces she will join Ryder and Kosta to reach the Pathfinder's position.
Locate the Pathfinder[]
Head towards the marked objective in the east, past the large tunnel doorway that previously had enemies. Lightning strikes have become more frequent, and some lightning rods have been extended to help draw away the blasts. There are a lot of corpses here - more than you and Liam killed if you explored this area earlier - and the party comments that Alec has been busy. Now that SAM's around you can scan the corpses again for additional analysis, but no RD.
You'll reach a couple of broken pipes which are spilling toxic waste. Move south but look to the western wall and you'll see a small chasm, the one leading to the shielded base if you explored it earlier. Climb up to go through and a cutscene will start.
Fight your way up to the monolith once the shields are down
Alec Ryder had been attempting to gain readings on the giant monolith. He had ideas about how to stop the storm that brought down the shuttles and was now keeping the repaired one from flying safely. Alec believes the power from the tower is reacting to the energy cloud and is causing the storms. His theory is that if the tower is shut down, the storms will stop.
If you explored the abandoned lab to the west, Alec praises your effort: ""Good work. You actually did some scouting."" If not, he has some choice admonitions. If you went through the mysterious cave nearby (optional objective not required to be accomplished), you'll have something to share when Alec explains the planet's climate disruption.
With the mission clear, the battle to take the tower begins as the Pathfinder blows up two of the lightning rods that have been protecting the aliens from the deadly strikes.
Follow the Pathfinder[]
Most of the building's lootable supplies are in the dark
Accompany Alec Ryder as he takes out the nearby stronghold that is protecting the tower. There are numerous loot containers and supply dumps throughout the battle area. Alec can slay enemies by himself with his nifty Profiles, so you can hang back and explore for a bit. There is no time pressure to move forward quickly to keep up with Alec.
There will be several waves of enemies that show up as the team moves through the building but each one can be taken out before moving forward. Watch out for telltale rising rocks that precede lightning strikes, they're very frequent here.
If you consult your map, the ""Unknown Megastructure"" layout follows a terraced design with ascending ramps and walkways, with the ultimate objective at the easternmost end. There are no scannable items from this point forward except for possibly one. At the bottom platform, there's a health cache and an ammo cache. The next platform has an open sort-of barracks with another health cache, an ammo cache, and two small containers. The next platform after that, with the damaged connecting walkway, has two small containers and a health cache.
The table stands empty if you rescued Greer; otherwise, this is how you find him
The damaged walkway leads to a door with an ammo cache to the right. Inside the door is a dark indoor chamber filled with artifacts, three lootable containers, two supply caches, and the body of Lucas Greer if you never bothered to save him. His corpse can be scanned for +10 and the team will have some reactions to it, but you will have to press onward.
Parallel to the chamber is a walkway, but it's exposed to lightning and there's nothing of value there. There's an upper level reachable from the chamber by jumping atop crates next to the easternmost lootable container, but you can backtrack to this later.
Once you reach the upper end of the ramp after the chamber, this objective concludes and switches to the next one.
Defend the Pathfinder[]
When you make it to the top, there's still some enemy resistance in the area. The bare minimum is an Unknown Heavy if Alec was left to his own devices for too long and killed everyone else before your arrival. Once they're all down, Alec walks over to a console and begins deciphering its language.
Supply caches and lootable containers in the foreground and the background
The lightning strikes have abated for the time being. Use the time to restock, replenish health, and explore the few remaining nooks and crannies of the place. Warning:  All regions beyond the walkways leading to the door are now off-limits once you meet up with Alec.
The immediate area in front of the big door has two ammo caches and one health cache. Next to the door (south side) there's a large container. The upper level reachable from the dark chamber earlier leads to three lootable containers, a health cache, and an ammo cache.
The walkways and chambers on the opposite side of the door lead to precisely nothing. There are a few large crates and zero illumination, nothing lootable.
Join the Pathfinder[]
Simply walking over to Alec will complete this objective, so you'll have to deliberately avoid him if you're still exploring.
Optional: Order Cora and Liam to defend both flanks[]
Anticipate from the left and right and don't be tempted to take the fight to the enemy
Place the squadmates in the white circle spots marked out on the ground on either side of the platform. This is a timed optional objective; it will be marked as failed if you haven't done so by the time the reinforcements arrive. Conversely, if you accomplished this ASAP, expect enemies almost immediately.
Alec starts decrypting for real when the hostiles arrive. Kill everyone you can until the decryption process is complete. Don't worry about the Pathfinder -  he's invincible - worry more about yourself dying.
Waves of enemies attack from both sides. Cloaking beasts will attempt to sneak by, in addition to regular troops and heavy weapon wielders. Help each squadmate by going back and forth between the two flanks (if you stationed them there) until Alec is done. If you have an offense-oriented playstyle, keep in mind the enemies will come to you, and you can't come to them because of mission boundaries.
Decryption only lasts for a couple of minutes. Near the end of the process, enemies start pulling back. When decryption is complete the door opens though it becomes stuck. Alec will ask you for help prying it open (+215XP) - when he walks over to the door and handles it, the defend the Pathfinder objective is marked complete. The remaining enemies do not have to be defeated. Warning:  Alec will call for you three times. If you still don't help him after the third try, the mission failure screen appears.
Open the door[]
The Pathfinder interfaces with the tower
This is the final objective. If you wish to loot from dead enemies, do so quickly before interacting with the door.
After the lifting the door open, the Ryders step inside during a cutscene. Alec uses SAM as a translator for the automated device in the chamber and shuts the tower down. The Ryders walk outside and notice that Alec has apparently succeeded; you can form one of two opinions on that. Note:  If you imported a previous playthrough, your helmet reverts to the one you were wearing the first time around.
However, both Ryders are blindsided by the fast-moving dark cloud coming from the monolith behind them. They're knocked down and off the platform. The visor in the younger Ryder's helmet is shattered, leaving them suffocating in the alien atmosphere. Alec limps over to his child and calls for the shuttle. Knowing it won't arrive in time, he makes a decision that he hopes will save Ryder Jr.'s life, likely at the cost of his own. He gives up his helmet and transfers Pathfinder authority and SAM to his child before he loses consciousness.
Harry, Liam, and Cora through a half-dead Ryder's eyes
The younger Ryder is rushed to the Hyperion med-bay by their squadmates, Dr. Carlyle, and Dr. Lexi T'Perro, then forwarded shortly to SAM Node in an attempt at resuscitation by integrating SAM further into their brain via a hardwired connection. Ryder awakes at the SAM Node and learns that not only can they privately communicate with SAM, but they've also been transferred the position of Pathfinder as their father's last act."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/H-047c:_A_New_World,"Prerequisite: Hunting the Archon
When Pathfinder Ryder returns to the Tempest after the first visit to Kadara Port during the mission above, a meeting called by Nakmor Drack is just starting. When the meeting is over this mission begins.
Travel to H-047c in the Remav system.[]
Ryder finds H-047c to be a world torn to pieces by the Scourge. H-047c was meant to be the new homeworld for the turians, but now there are only some exiles on pieces of the world. There is no protective magnetic field so the cosmic radiation is extremely high. Hardsuits won't be able to protect against radiation so the whole squad will have to stay in the ND1 Nomad.
After landing on the ruined rock, the mission completes.",
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Prologue:_Hyperion,"Since this is the very first mission, you obtain this one immediately after generating a new character or importing an existing character.","This prologue mission is mainly intended to present the events that lead to Pathfinder Ryder assuming the protagonist role. Taking place six hundred years after the events of Mass Effect 3, in an entirely different galaxy, this is a fresh start.
Upon waking up from cryostasis, Ryder will be taken to the Cryo Bay to be checked out by Dr. Lexi T'Perro. Lexi checks your SAM implant and makes sure you're ready for action. If you're playing on a fresh game, Ryder starts on the default short-sleeved casual outfit. If you're playing on a New Game Plus, Ryder starts this game wearing their last outfit, but using the default white and blue color scheme.
As Ryder begins to regain bearings with some warm coffee, a cutscene starts and something goes wrong where the ark encounters a strange celestial energy cloud. The cloud managed to damage one of the relays on the ship near the Cryo Bay causing a temporary loss of gravity and erupting chaos throughout the ark. Cora Harper then enters and fixes the gravity issue.
After the cutscene, you're given the first primary objective of the game and an optional objective to check on Ryder's twin sibling who is currently in a damaged cryopod nearby.
Report to the Hyperion bridge[]
Simply follow the navigational marker to the bridge. You can consult the map for directions. Since you'll arrive there eventually to progress the game, you can spend some time exploring the immediate surroundings.
If you get lost, you can always consult the navpoints on your HUD and map ( for main objectives and  for optionals) that also mark how far you are from them.
Optional: Check on your brother/sister[]
All the more reason to have just one active protagonist despite the existence of twins
To accomplish the optional objective, you need to talk to Dr. T'Perro (marked with). It appears that your sibling, although in stable condition, will have to remain in a low-level coma temporarily. Cora loiters here first, then walks toward the door afterwards.
After completing the objective, feel free to investigate the nearby area for datapads, interesting conversations, or learn more about the mission from the information wall located on the eastern wall of the Cryo Bay.
Hayes has a couple of opinions by the information wall. Dr. Harry Carlyle assesses Liam Kosta's health by the beds. Dusty Kirkland and David Fisher engage in idle talk near the exit. Greer by the cryo pods is recently defrosted and being coaxed into lucidity. They (and Lexi) have some dialogue snippets in and outside their conversation triggers, so if you want to hear them all simply walk a considerable distance from them then return to load their next batch of lines. Be wary of potential audio overlap though, if done incorrectly.
If you consult the game menu, one of the things you can access right after assuming control of your Ryder character is the Codex. This is a database of background information about the setting, and throughout the rest of the game it will be updated with new, rewritten, or appended entries as a result of plot progression. At the very beginning you get several bootstrap entries that can be read at your convenience. After checking on your sibling, the codex updates with an entry for either Scott or Sara Ryder.
The five datapads during this mission are only available during this mission. Read the datapads now or they will be gone.
Message from Captain Dunn

Attention Hyperion personnel:

After a 600-year voyage, the good news is we're exactly where we're supposed to be: We have arrived in the Heleus Cluster, Andromeda Galaxy, year 2819. All stasis medical personnel should report for duty immediately. Give the Pathfinder Mission team revival priority, and prep its members for field reconnaissance.

Reports of an unusual celestial phenomenon in the cluster are being investigated. Updates to follow.

Captain Dunn
Message from Jien Garson

Hello, Traveler, and welcome to your first day in Andromeda! This is the dawn of a new era for all of us. As you recover from stasis, know that you're in good hands. In a few short hours, you'll be leaving the Hyperion and joining thousands of your fellow colonists as you chase your fortunes and build the new life you've always dreamed about. It's been a long wait—but I promise you it will be worth it.

Jien Garson
Founder, Andromeda Initiative
Once you're ready, head to themarker (known as a navpoint) to use the door to exit the Cryo Bay.
Investigate the malfunction[]
Damaged Power Relay
Upon exiting the Cryo Bay, Ryder witnesses an explosion from a damaged power relay. As the crew attempts to fix the problem, they call on you to use the new scanner function to locate and repair the damaged power conduit.
Note: If you didn't check up on your twin earlier, the optional mission is marked as failed at this point since the door closes behind you during the explosion.
Scan the power conduit to locate the fault[]
Push the button that brings up the scanner, aim it at the damaged area, and you will find three items that glow dark orange until successfully scanned. Target the three items (Compensator Relay, Axial Coupling, and the Phase Coil) and push the appropriate button so the items change to a light yellow color and a description box of each item appears. Only the Compensator Relay is required to be scanned before the next objective appears.
Note: This minor objective introduces the scanner function of Ryder's omni-tool. This mechanic will be important throughout the game.
Reset the power relay[]
After scanning the correct component, a new objective and a new navpoint becomes active. Approach and interact with the Power Terminal up the stairs to avert another disaster in the Cryo Bay.
The codex entry for the scanner becomes available upon completion.
Head to the tram[]
If, for some reason, you didn't check up on your sibling earlier, Cora runs toward the tram updating you of Lexi's findings regarding your twin.
Head towards the navpoint on the tram and there is a datapad on the floor in the hallway.

Open the door to enter the tram.
Wait for Cora[]
Cora will come running up the hallway and into the tram. Note: This only appears if you got to the tram earlier than her.
Activate the tram[]
Interact with the Tram Console to take the tram to the bridge.
Once you and Cora arrive, a brief cutscene ensues where Captain Nozomi Dunn and Alec Ryder argue over the next move to make: assess and repair Hyperion, or find some solid ground to land on first. Shortly after, Captain Dunn notes Ryder Sr.'s intractability and allows you to give an opinion on that. It doesn't matter which dialogue choices you select, soon you'll be preparing for the first mission to Habitat 7, New Earth.
Dress up, lock and load
After the cutscene, you and Cora next appear in a staging room in the hangar bay. Several new codex entries are added at the end of your talk with Cora, namely about your mom and dad (and twin, if you failed the optional objective), Cora herself, golden worlds, and the yet-unnamed phenomenon plaguing Hyperion.
Note: On fresh games, you start with a basic white/blue Initiative Armor I set. On New Game +, your first combat suit is a black/red Initiative Armor X set regardless of prior level. These can be verified upon gaining access to the inventory in the next mission. Both sets require a helmet, leading to the next objective.
Get your helmet[]
Pick up your helmet on the armor rack behind Dusty Kirkland and Lucas Greer. This is an Initiative Helmet I.
Collect a sidearm[]
Alec now authorizes the use of firearms and SAM unlocks the weapons locker on the other side of the room. Pick up the firearm. This is an M-3 Predator. Unlike the helmet, the Predator is level I if on a fresh game or level X if imported from New Game Plus.
Should you draw out the gun, the game will tell you how to holster it. Should you try to fire it for whatever reason nothing happens; Cora admonishes a warning and considers it fortunate the safeties are on.
In the room are two additional datapads.
Pathfinder Team Field Manual

**First Contact Protocol**

In the event any member of the Pathfinder Team encounters intelligent alien life, it is imperative that ""first contact"" protocols be strictly observed. The Andromeda Initiative holds the principles of peace and cooperation among our highest ideals. Aggressive action against extraterrestrials is only permitted when hostile intent is clearly demonstrated and Pathfinder team members are at obvious risk of injury or death.

Introduction

As a member of the Pathfinder Team, you play a critical role in the Andromeda Initiative's efforts to establish a foothold in the new galaxy. The team faces many challenges:

- Golden world site verification
- Reconnaissance and mapping of unknown territories (planetary and celestial)
- Scientific analysis and discovery of new phenomenon
- Potential first contact with extraterrestrials
- Establishing diplomatic relations with local inhabitants
- General support of settlement outposts
All the space magic in the universe can't eradicate basic superstition
You can interact with several items and characters in the room. Alec's ""good luck rock"" is on one corner. Between that and Cora's location is a water cooler (that can't be drunk from; no bathroom breaks planetside apparently). You can also inspect your dad's and your sibling's lockers for some mood setting.
Kirkland and Greer can be talked to and the latter inquires what's going on, where you can answer in any manner. The ambient music terminal near them can be deactivated, to Kirkland's consternation, but it can be reactivated once. Pathfinder team member David Fisher will comment on your decision to side with either Captain Dunn or Alec Ryder in the previous cutscene, and after talking to him the codex entry for N7 will be unlocked.
Scanning the aforementioned items and characters yields some basic information and not much else.
Report to the hangar bay[]
Once you're ready, head out beyond the door.
On the shuttle bay Dr. Carlyle prepares some crates in anticipation of tagging along with the mission to the planet, prompting a response from you. Afterward, Alec talks about your sibling and requires another response from you. In both dialogue cases, choose whichever you feel is appropriate.
Following these, Alec assembles the team and gives a brief rousing speech. Now it's time to board the shuttle and begin exploration. The mission then completes, but not shown on screen."

This mission can only be acquired after the previous one has been completed and Eos, Voeld, Havarl, Kadara, and Elaaden have all reached 100% viability. SAM will tell you that there's an important communication at the Tempest vidcon.","Access message on Tempest vidcon[]
Oddly, there's no actual call available. Instead, SAM informs Ryder that they now have a new mission objective at Habitat 7. He's not permitted to tell Ryder what it is, but warns Ryder not to be late. Note:  There's no actual timer associated with the mission.
Return to Habitat 7 in Eriksson System[]
Immediately after the Tempest enters orbit around Habitat 7 in the Eriksson system, a cutscene begins. Kallo Jath notices Initiative terraforming equipment in place around the planet. While Habitat 7's vault is damaged and useless, the world can still be made viable, although it will take many years.
SAM opens communications channels to Initiative settlements around the Heleus Cluster, and informs Ryder that Habitat 7 has been renamed. By unanimous vote, the world will now be known as ""Ryder-I"". Cue applause from all the settlements over the comm.
Note:  The planet's name does not actually change on the Galaxy Map."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Elaaden:_A_New_World,"Prerequisite: Hunting the Archon
Upon returning to the Tempest from the first visit to Kadara Port, a meeting called by Drack starts automatically. When the meeting is over this mission is automatically acquired. An email is also sent by Drack.
This sounds bad, kid
To: Ryder
From: Drack

Thought I'd show you what Strux sent me. A transcript of an audio log that's got me worried about the colony. Sounds like Morda's cooking up something. Don't know what to think:

Morda: Stop arguing with me, Brenk! It's payback time for the Initiative.
Brenk: They don't care about us.
Morda: But they will. Soon they're gonna know that I'm Overlord. And once I execute my plan, there'll be no denying that the krogan rule Heleus. Then they'll come begging to us.
Brenk: Okay, Morda. I'll get a team together. Gather everything we need.
Morda: No krogan bows down to the Nexus again.","This mission is technically a Priority Op in that it kickstarts a chain of Heleus Assignments that may result in improving the world's viability, which is one of the requirements in the final Priority Op. However, this mission chain is independent of the main storyline, meaning it can also be done after the main threats have been dealt with, though potentially at the expense of some character interactions.
Travel to Elaaden in the Zaubray system to meet with the krogan contact[]
As stated, proceed to Zaubray. When you're in orbit above Elaaden choose a squad using the Loadout screen and move out. A cutscene then starts with Pathfinder Ryder summoning Drack to the bridge while Kallo Jath begins the landing procedures. You'll learn a few things about the area ahead, including the prominent half-buried Remnant starship.
Later, Drack disembarks from the Tempest at the same time as Ryder (even if Drack isn't chosen for the squad). If he isn't with the squad he will go ahead to the New Tuchanka colony to smooth things over and will be waiting at the New Tuchanka gate on your first approach to the colony. If he's with the squad, though, he answers Ryder's query about what sort of people live on the world.
This mission completes automatically after the first landing on Elaaden, with no rewards of any kind given. The follow-up mission Conflict in the Colony then starts afterward.

Conflict in the Colony"
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Stage_a_Rescue,"Prerequisite: Eyes on the Ground or On the Frontlines
Prerequisite: Meet the Resistance
The mission is automatically acquired when either of the identical missions above is completed by talking to the angara Skeot at Hjara Station on Voeld. Regardless of whether you'll think about it or agree to help immediately, Skeot gives you the relevant navpoint and mission.
This mission can also be obtained by simply approaching the Northern Holding Site, as soon as you exit the Angaran Resistance Base and explore the world. This normally happens if you travel to the location for Task: Clearing the Air and/or bypass the expected mission chain.
Note: The mission is either a Priority Op or a Heleus Assignment depending on its prerequisite's mission type. If it was acquired through exploration, it only shows up in the Completed Missions part of the journal afterward if you haven't done Helping Havarl's Scientists yet, using the Priority Op mission image. If you did, then this mission is classified a Heleus Assignment, and the initial pertinent objectives switch to Rescue captured angara and Speak to rescued angara upon discovery of the holding site.","Reach kett holding site[]
Just a few of the enemy forces standing between you and the objectives
The navpoint  is located at a heavily guarded kett base named the Northern Holding Site. Make use of the heaters scattered around to ensure the cold hazard doesn't sap Ryder's life support too much.
Enemy composition is standard numerous amounts of Chosen, plus a few Anointed, Destined and/or Wraiths.
Rescue Niilj and other captured angara[]
The angara are imprisoned in four cages with an orange glow. Use the console next to each cage to free the prisoners. The angara will join you in fighting the kett when released.
Four angara pens and a couple of guards rushing to prevent their liberation
Liberating them early is recommended, as unlike most NPC-NPC skirmishes they can actually deal damage while being invulnerable themselves.
Clear remaining kett[]
Once all cages are sprung the objective switches to cleanup. Two waves of single dropship reinforcements briefly replenish enemy numbers so prepare accordingly.
After the battle, there a numerous lootable containers scattered around the site and inside the building.
There is a datapad on the ground next to one of the cages. Inside the building is a terminal with multiple entries.
Speak to Niilj[]
After releasing all the prisoners, talk to Niilj. He says the angara will head back to the Angaran Resistance Base, but another angara mentions that a drive containing vital data from the kett network must be delivered. The angara ask that you take the drive to Buxil in Techiix.
Completing the conversation completes this mission. The mission Meet the Family is automatically acquired.
If this is a Priority Op, a conversation with Jaal will now begin; if Jaal is not in the squad, he will fly to the camp via shuttle. Rescuing the prisoners has been enough to gain Evfra's trust, so you will be given the options of heading to Techiix or advancing A Trail of Hope II by talking to Evfra immediately. If you choose to talk to Evfra, the squad will immediately take a shuttle to the Tempest and leave the planet."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/The_Journey_to_Meridian,"Prerequisite: Hunting the Archon
This mission is acquired immediately after completing the mission above.
Since recovering arks is part of the focus of optional side-missions, it's possible to launch this mission without the entire cohort of pathfinders, which impacts the dialogue heard.
After recovering the third and final Pathfinder, Ryder will be invited by email to a get-together of the Pathfinders at Pathfinder HQ. If ""The Journey to Meridian"" awaits triggering by entering the Pathfinder HQ, this reunion party does not occur until you re-enter Pathfinder HQ after meeting with the Pathfinders in the Tech Lab.","Speak to the leaders on the Nexus[]
Return to the Nexus and head to Jarun Tann's office/Pathfinder HQ. A cutscene begins as Pathfinder Ryder enters a meeting with the Nexus leadership. Ryder tells them that they wish to go immediately after the Meridian, but the leaders are skeptical, not wishing to provoke open war with the kett. The other Pathfinders enter the meeting and support Ryder but Tann vetoes the plan anyway.
Following the meeting, the other Pathfinders tell Ryder that they have an alternative but the conversation is interrupted by an urgent call. Ryder's sibling has suddenly awakened. The Pathfinders will meet Ryder later in the Tech Lab and Ryder is immediately transported to the Hyperion's Cryo Bay.
The conversation is a bit different depending on what you told your sibling during their earlier conversation while they were in the stasis coma but the consequences are the same. Ryder's sibling still needs to rest and isn't cleared to leave the medical facility yet.
An optional conversation with the sibling is now available.
You can now meet with the other Pathfinders at their discretion in the Tech Lab.
Ryder Family Secrets may now be completed if all memory triggers have already been found.
Discuss your options with the other Pathfinders[]
Head to the Tech Lab on the upper level of the Docking Bay. The other Pathfinders and Dr. Aridana have a plan. A new technology called Ghost Storm will confuse kett sensors with multiple fake targets, allowing the Tempest to approach Meridian and land. Once the Tempest is upgraded, the mission can proceed.
Integrate Ghost Storm Technology with Tempest to help other Pathfinders[]
Return to the Tempest. The Ghost Storm upgrade doesn't use the standard R&D console. Instead, look for a console on the side of the console room near the Tech Lab entrance. Interact with console to build the Ghost Storm Technology. Once this is activated, the Tempest is ready for the mission.
Gather the crew in the Tempest's meeting room to prepare for the mission[]
Use the vidcon in the meeting room to ""Call Crew Meeting"" to inform the crew of the upcoming mission.
Go to Khi Tasira in the Civki System[]
The Civki system now becomes available on the Galaxy Map. Fly to the system and approach Khi Tasira, what the kett call Meridian. Scans reveal that Meridian is a large Remnant space station.
Interact with the Khi Tasira drop zone to formally begin the mission. If you have a stash of Backup Life Support, reserve a Consumable slot for one as you may need it later.
This is the absolute point of no return for this particularly lengthy mission. Once you go down to the space station you are obligated to see it through to the end before you are able to wander around Heleus again. If you have any other outstanding tasks you need to accomplish, attend to them first.
Survey the drop zone[]
Note:  Manual saving will be disabled for the duration of this mission.
It proves impossible to actually land the Tempest on Meridian, so Ryder and squadmates are simply dropped onto the station, which has artificial gravity, atmosphere, and even, for some reason, rain. One of the squadmates will have something to say on that last bit.
To the left from your initial position there is an Adaptive Remnant Core Device that can be scanned for +100  and right next to it is a scannable Kett Equipment that elicits some reactions from the squad.
The only way forward ends at a chasm, but scanning the floor will reveal a power conduit leading to a nearby Remnant Console. Interact with the console to activate the bridge and SAM detects a central command hub for the station, which is currently inactive. You can then head down the ramp and a bridge will be created across the chasm as Ryder proceeds toward the door. If you scan the floor, you'll see power conduits snaking deeper to the station. Take note of this every now and then, as this will guide your path across the massive maps.
The exploration tower (left) is heavily polluted with Scourge while the research tower (right) is overgrown with vegetation.
Go through the door and to the console in the next room. Activating the console starts a cutscene where a window opens ahead with a view of the central command hub and secondary towers to the north and south. SAM informs Ryder that the two secondary towers will need to be activated before activating the hub, similar to how vault activation has worked. The Pathfinder and the squad discuss the possibility that activating the hub may start a purification field like the previous planetary vaults.
Note: The current objective is now complete and there are now two other objectives that replace it:
Access the tower in the research sector
Access the tower in the exploration sector
These aren't important for now, use the nearby gravity well first and head down to the lower level.
Take note of the telltale ripples of the cloaked Wraiths at the bottom of the image
At the bottom of the gravity well, You'll overhear kett transmissions and see enemies on your radar to the east. A Strange Remnant Device on the upper ledge to the west of Ryder can be scanned for +10 .
Proceed forward to the east towards the hub to open the door and head into Gateway: Sector 17. You will encounter a kett force consisting of a two Wraiths, two Chosen, and one Anointed. Be careful of enemies on platforms above Ryder who can shoot down over your cover.
Warning:  This mission features many areas that look like smooth floors but are actually pools of electrical ferrofluid. These pools are Level 4 Electrical Hazards and will kill Ryder very quickly. Be careful when exploring areas. These areas tend to be underneath elevated platforms or in low areas. There are small ledges on the floor that delineate what is flooring and what is a pool. This delineation is blurred in damaged areas where the fluid tends to pool in low areas or damaged spots.
Dakka vs. Beam Spam
Once you wander too far east towards the burning wreck, a squadmate then notices incoming reinforcements of Chosen and Anointed, but there are two Observers also joining the fray who will attack all organics in sight. Either fall back and let them kill each other, or wade in yourself and dispatch of them as you see fit.
When all hostiles are killed, explore the surrounding area for loot. Looking forward from where you first came in, on the elevated platform to the right is a lootable container and a datapad.
Remnant City: Kett ReportTranslated from Tonaizhet: 

Commander's Report: 

Lack of progress in Sector 16-1. Remnant defenses adapt to bypass attempts. The Archon's mandate not to use force is frustrating some senior analysts. There was one attempt to crack a door with an explosive. Those involved were subjected to disciplinary action, per the Archon's wishes. Remnant technology is sensitive and utmost care must be taken when attempting to reveal it secrets. 

Another warning has been issued to all soldiers, with a full accounting of the consequences they face if Khi Tasira is damaged in any way.
On the left elevated platform is an ammo/power cell supply cache.
By the burning wreck is a scannable Scourge Energy Pocket and another container. At the bottom of the north ramp is an ammo cache and at the bottom of the south ramp is a health cache.
When you've cleaned out the immediate area, you'll notice that the path splits left and right by the burning wreckage. The ramps leading up to the north go to Sector 17 - Exploration and the south leads to Sector 17 - Research. Which area to go through first is entirely up to you since you'll end up in the same place later, but for the purposes of this walkthrough the exploration sector is explored first. Note:  you should explore the starting area of BOTH paths to collect any RD or items as progressing far enough on either path means you'll have to drop down and won't be able to get back up by conventional means to collect those items.
Access the tower in the exploration sector[]
For this walkthrough, Sector 17 - Exploration (north) will be the path explored first. This means you should clear out the starting portion of the Sector 17 - Research area (to the south) first. One of the squadmates will have something to say upon seeing the crates of kett equipment at the bend.
Head up the ramp to the south and on the lower level is a lootable container. The squad are astounded that there are plants growing out of the grate and on the walls of the station. On the upper level, the tree-like structure is called Strange Vegetation and can be scanned for +10 . There is a uranium node near the tree. Do not drop down into the area below!
With all loot at hand, head back down to Gateway: Sector 17 and proceed to the north tower. On entering the area one of the squad will have some comments on the clouds overhead.
Behold a bad case of warped spacetime
Be careful not to walk into Scourge Energy Pockets along the way, and there are many of them here. You will see dead kett and a lootable container further along near an area with missing floor plates; don't fall through. There is another lootable container on the southern wall next to a dead kett.
Just past this damaged area you will encounter some Wraiths and Observers, fighting each other if otherwise not occupied with you. Let them fight -- Ryder will receive combat XP whoever makes the kill -- and finish off the survivors. A console here will spawn a friendly Observer; unfortunately, it won't follow you out of this area.
Further along you will find a wrecked console and a torn-up area of floor, with numerous Scourge pockets. Once you have looted the container that is present, jump down. Try not to land in the electrical ferrofluid or the Scourge tendrils, since both will wipe out Ryder's life support and then health. At the bottom, SAM tells Ryder that he believes the Scourge spread from here to the rest of Heleus. Either the Remnant builders did it or someone did it to them.
There's a scannable downed kett ship with Scourge growing out of it next to the burning wreckage. The raised platform to the right offers a way around the Scourge tendrils and electrical ferrofluid.
Ignore the cool vs. awesome fight for now and focus on raiding Remnant containers
From the western portion of the platform, you may see another kett-Remnant fight to the south. Don't get involved for now; anyone you kill will simply respawn and have to be killed again later. Proceed to the east instead. A console here extends a bridge that leads to a walkway that wraps back around to the area where the kett and Remnant were fighting - if you activate the other console on the other end, the bridge now extends to the ferrofluid below leading to a lootable container.
Just a bit further south is a small ledge with a container, and on an extrusion from that ledge is another container. One of the squadmates cautions against the gaping chasm; be careful not to overshoot your movements.
Assuming control over turrets is a common presented choice throughout the mission
For now, head north from the bridge console to another console and door, with a Remnant turret and a couple of Observers, Assemblers (and independently-spawned Breachers) standing in Ryder's way. If you can sneak past the gauntlet of bots through Tactical Cloak or just quick dashing you can take command of the turret via the console just behind it.
There is a lootable container on the left elevated walkway. There are ammo and health caches on the right.
Activate the tower in the exploration sector[]
The target console helpfully blinks red
Use the console to open the door and enter a small room. Open the second door and head into the Exploration Systems area.
Your target is the console on the far side of this room. There are a couple of hidden items here: one is a container under the right ramp from the entrance. Also make sure to scan the Adaptive Remnant Core Device +100  under the console behind a support pillar.
There are two ammo caches: one beside the target console and another on the left walkway from the entrance. There is a data pattern just east of the central cube.

You can scan one of the Remnant Security Nodes (alternatively labeled Observer Replication Control) for +10 .
Activate the Exploration Systems console. Turns out it isn't quite working yet; Ryder needs to reconnect power to restore full functionality.
Reroute power to the main console[]
Start with the near console on the right walkway and doublecheck using the energy pipe overlay below
The console helpfully projects a wiring diagram for Ryder. Activate the four consoles on the west and east balconies in the order shown to restore the power. From the console, follow the 'Z' pattern by starting from the bottom right glyph.
Activating consoles in the wrong order will spawn hostile Remnant. Once you're done, an energy field begins to block the way you came in. Definitely sounds like a fight is impending, so be ready. Return to the north balcony and activate the main console to start a cutscene.
A Destroyer says hello
Flight Controls are now online and a bunch of Remnant exploratory vessels power up. Unfortunately, kett immediately show up and start boarding the ships. The console informs Ryder that it can't receive commands from the Meridian Engine. What that actually means will have to wait because Remnant defenses are now activated. Specifically, several Assemblers and a Destroyer. Once you defeat them the entrance blocking field drops and you can now leave the area.
Access the tower in the research sector[]
As you exit Explorations Systems, Observers fly in to attack. The turret in this area has also been rebuilt if it has been destroyed before. If it wasn't commandeered earlier, it now fights on your side, apparently believing that Ryder is the new Administrator. Go back south to the bend with containers and turn right into the kett-Remnant fight mentioned earlier.
One can make the case they're both ugly, but one faction technically doesn't care about anything beyond their tech
This setup includes a Behemoth (if you saved Zevin Raeka over Drack's scouts), a turret with a control console and an ammo cache just beside it, some Chosen and Wraiths, a Nullifier, and some Observers.
The area beneath the turret is solid ground that has two containers in it. If you look to the east upon dropping down there's an Adaptive Remnant Core Device +100  in the ferrofluid underneath the platform you were just fighting on.
Further south of the main platform is a chasm with a nearby console to raise a bridge. Before crossing it, backtrack a bit and go to the raised platform opposite of the turret. There's a scannable data pattern beside the Scourge tendril:

Go back south and extend the bridge to reach Core 17 - Central (technically you can dash-jump across the chasm with little effort, but that wouldn't be very convenient). Your final destination is to the east, but until Ryder activates both towers it's blocked off by an energy barrier. Before heading south, you can go west to scan a Remnant data pattern which explains the rain.

Translated from the Remnant language:

Refrain from filing inquiries about malfunctioning climate regulator. The issue is known and will be corrected.

Cooperation appreciated.
The south tower and research area is full of trees and other plants. Keep an eye out for mineral nodes such as uranium and vanadium.
Welcome to kett country
A kett shuttle drops some troops by the big tree surrounded by mushrooms. The welcoming party consists of a Destined and a Chosen. They maybe distracted by a few Observers to the east, meaning less work for you. When they're dead, look out for a container partially hidden by a mushroom, near the visible health cache.
The layout of the catwalks here is a bit confusing, if not downright irrational. On occasion Wraiths prowl the smaller catwalks while camouflaged. The western route leads to a fight with a Fiend and some Wraiths. With a bit of effort you can use the plants to scale up the big wall and end up on the first juncture between Exploration and Research towers. On a pool of ferrofluid near some mushrooms and long containers here is a uranium node. Opposite the long containers, atop two other long containers is a lootable container.
The southern route is a little more difficult to navigate. The simplest route is to head east, and then up the catwalks, staying on the east side.
It doesn't matter which route is taken but you should systematically clear and explore the entire area as there are lots of lootable containers to find.
Set phasers to kill
South from the aforementioned Fiend and Wraiths encounter, Ryder helpfully points out there's a usable Remnant console nearby. It spawns an Observer that can help against incoming Anointed and Chosen.
On the platform beneath the Observer Replication Control, go to the ramp going eastward with a giant tree jutting out of the chasm south. Hidden below the long container at the side of the ramp is a lootable container. Go back up to the Observer Replication Control platform and head south. At the southmost edge bending to the east there's an ammo cache and a crate. The giant trees here are quite solid and they can be used to hop from one walkway to another, although care must still be taken to avoid taking a bath in the ferrofluid below. Nestled in a giant tree with mushrooms is a uranium node, and next to it by some barricades is a health cache.
A gaggle of Chosen (to die by your hand)
Further eastward by this route you should arrive at a courtyard with a Remnant turret, a bunch of kett crates and barricades, and some Chosen. The turret can be controlled from the console on the elevated walkway in front of you. It's recommended to do so, since it will see some use again later. Ryder comments on the amount of equipment in the area, figuring the kett must've set up camp.
Before proceeding through the heavy door you may want to clean the entire area out first. To the right of the door behind a barricade is a container. At the bottom of the ramp by large nonlootable containers, an ammo cache. Next to it, a datapad:
The Archon SpeaksTranslated from Tonaizhet:

The human Pathfinder will make an attempt on Khi Tasira, or ""Meridian,"" as it is known to these creatures. It is a predictable course of action. It believes itself my equal, and will attempt to steal the Remnant's power from us. We have worked long and hard to unlock these secrets. We will not be usurped by this lesser creature. I have dispatched my enforcer -- my Sword -- to the space station to handle this human. She will be my voice. Obey her as you would your Archon.

Work on the Remnant must continue in the meantime. With Khi Tasira fully under my control, Heleus, the angara, and the Pathfinder's people will all yield. Our rise is assured.  It has always been assured. Victory is inevitable, and kett are patient.

If your scanner sense is pinging, the culprit is likely to be beneath
Just north of the kett camp, over the east edge of the catwalk, you will see a doorway and a broken bridge. Jump down to this and then jump over where the bridge used to be.
This brings you to a puzzle-locked door. You're in the right place once a squadmate expresses concern against falling and when SAM notifies you of the higher encryption on the door. Solve the puzzle (needed for the Cryptographer Achievement). See below for the solution. Note:  This puzzle can't be overridden with a Remnant Decryption Key and must be solved.
You receive +270 XP for opening the door. After solving the puzzle, enter the room to find two loot containers and a pod containing an Unknown Organism which can be scanned for +10 . Return by climbing to the top of the doorway for extra height and jumping the gaps back up.
How on Khi Tasira does an Adaptive Core end up upside down, or how do trees and minerals grow here in the first place
Further north from the camp is a giant tree with a container. The pile of rubble near it also has a container, and if you haven't scanned it yet your scanner will ping but it isn't obvious where. It's because there's a very well-hidden Adaptive Remnant Core Device on the underside of the platform (+100 ). You can see and scan the device from the lower catwalk in jumping distance westward. Immediately afterward, on the ramp going up to the north there's a uranium node near a tree.
At the end of the aforementioned ramp to your left should be where you entered the research area. To your right, east, is another giant tree. On its roots hidden behind kett crates is a container.
Uranium by the ferrofluid and a container near some crates
When you return to the tree and mushroom patch beyond the bridge you've come full circle and the only area you probably haven't gone to yet is the center south route. One walkway goes down, the other goes up. The upper walkway veers right to the Observer console area and you've already picked it clean, so go down the lower walkway. Inspect the mushroom beside the nearby giant tree for an adjacent vanadium node. Veering westward, there's a uranium node by some fungi and plants while behind two kett crates is a container.
Once you're certain you've looted everything in the area (or if you wish to hurry up with the mission proper) go back to the kett camp and proceed through the two sets of doors.
Activate the tower in the research sector[]
For an easier time use the console on the left walkway to commandeer the turret
The next area will greet you with a heavy kett assault; an initial wave of Destined and Wraiths, followed by Anointed and a Behemoth. SAM tells Ryder that Remnant defenses in the area can be activated to repel the kett. Up on the left-hand catwalk (north) a console will activate a turret, and a console on the other catwalk will activate shield generators on the south side of the room.
After defeating the kett, look around the room for any lootable remains or containers. From where you came in, the west walkway has a container, an ammo cache, a uranium node in the ferrofluid pool, scannable Remnant Pods along the upper walkway (+10 ) and a lootable container hidden behind two stacks of long double containers next to the ramp going to Archives. The east walkway has another uranium node in the ferrofluid pool, a lootable container and health cache on the upper walkway, and another lootable container next to the ramp going to Archives, atop three long containers.
Bedlam but fun
Look up and you'll notice plant branches entwining what seems to be a wide beam. You can actually reach that beam through the branches at the west walkway. There's a Kett Core Encryption Tech (+100 ) there, although you can scan it from certain vantage points on the ground.
When you're done use the console on the southern end to open the door to the Archives and head inside. Don't forget the last container that is literally next to the door before going in.
The giant mushrooms you've been seeing have a name, sort of. Scan the Monstrous Fungi as you enter for +10 . The room beyond contains two alcoves blocked with energy barriers, a locked door, many storage pods, and a console. Activating the console starts a cutscene during which the console powers up the Archives and reveals exactly what is being archived. It turns out to be prototypes of the angara, who are revealed to be a synthetic race created by the builders of Meridian. The previous objective will complete and the next will be added during the cutscene.
Enter Meridian's central command[]
Jardaan experiments
With the Archives activated, the energy barriers go down and some Observers activate nearby; they're currently not hostile and will remain so if you avoid them. Scan the nearby Angaran Templates for +10 .
There is a lootable container by the western chamber, beside the Observer Replication Control. Above it, a console is visible on a platform. The tree at the back of the alcove has a uranium node. The platform with the console is accessible by first jumping up onto the nearby fungi or the narrow side ledges on the back wall. Don't forget the Adaptive Remnant Core Device (+100 ). Activate the console to open the door on the east side to find a Remnant Data Core for Task: Remnant Data Cores, a loot container, and a Data Pattern:

The southern alcove contains a Gnarled Tree which can be scanned for +10  and a vanadium node.
Pool's closed / swamp's drained
When you're done, go back the way you came from. Activating the Archives has changed something in the room with the turret and shield generators. The turret, if destroyed, is up again and the central pool of electrical ferrofluid has drained revealing Remnant equipment. Jump into now empty pool to loot its contents.
There are 2 containers here. The Remnant Pods gives +10 ; SAM says it contains a plant but the scanner text says it's an egg. The data pattern reveals something about experiments on, presumably, the angara.

Translated from the Remnant language:

Selected skill appears well-suited to the biology. The chosen(IMPRECISE: ALT. ""heirs,"" ""generation"") discovered multiple applications; a large percentage of them completely independently. 
Director considers the test a success.

A commandeered turret is always good for distractions
Proceed south into the kett camp. Be prepared for a battle featuring an Ascendant and a shuttle full of Chosen and Anointed. The shuttle group arrives together, making a convenient target for Area of Effect (AoE) abilities. If you took command of the turret earlier, this ""battle"" should become a non-issue. Defeat them and, if you're certain you don't need to sweep the area one last time for any missed loot, head back to the bridge leading to the Core 17 - Central area.
As you approach the bridge, a kett assault force consisting of a Fiend and several Chosen and Anointed will be racing for the tower, where they're confronted by Remnant defenses including a Destroyer. Let the two hostile enemy forces tear each other up before getting involved; finish off any survivors.
""(Laughs) Forgot about the Remnant, did you? Assholes!""
If you get curious, there are two kett consoles by the entrance. One of them can apparently be ""deactivated"", although nothing happens if you try. This console also has a nearby lootable container that isn't present on your first pass through the area earlier.
Further along, you will find several Nullifiers and Assemblers. The first group is best taken from the catwalk above. The two Nullifiers near the door are probably best taken out from below, where there's more cover. Assemblers will spawn continuously until the Nullifiers are destroyed. There are explosive canisters scattered about; if you can make them part of your battle plans then by all means do so.
Last-ditch backseat defenders
There are a number of lootable containers in this area and the previous one. Search the area carefully and collect them. Starting from the entrance: a highly visible ammo cache, a container on the lower left side (northeast), a health cache between 2 pillars behind the center ramp, an ammo cache on the upper right walkway (southeast), another ammo cache on the left platform before the door (northeast), and another lootable container just before the door itself.
When you're ready, go through the doors, where you'll discover a gravity well leading to Meridian's central command. Before heading up, you can scan a Remnant data pattern on the platform behind and above the well. On one of these data patterns which may or may not trigger with this one SAM reveals that the Remnant language is similar to angaran.

Opposition's (IMPRECISE; ALT. ""foe,"" defiler"") next moves learned from secrets (IMPRECISE; ALT. ""intelligence,"" news"") from Jheln (TRANSLATION NOT FOUND). Take action. Protect the work.

Individual life is nothing; the machine of life is everything.
There are lootable containers on the upper platform and below the ledge near it as well as another ammo cache beside the data pattern. When you're ready, take the gravity well.
Interface with the command hub[]
When Ryder reaches the top of the gravity well, there is a lootable container in the corner of the room (northeast) and another one by the door (southwest). Head to the doors to enter the Command Hub.
Hopefully, no jumping into the endless energy stream this time
As you enter the Command Hub, an Adaptive Remnant Core Device below the right side of the ramp up can be scanned for +100 ; the device on the left side is damaged and useless. Underneath the south ramp that leads to the console next to the beam housing is a well-hidden Adaptive Remnant Core Device (+100 ). Take time to survey the room before activating the main console and note the positions of health, ammo, and explosive objects, since there's going to be a fight here in a few minutes.
Activating the central console is somewhat anticlimactic; the console does nothing because the ""Meridian Engine"" is no longer present. SAM discovers a log revealing that the creators of Meridian, who are named the Jardaan, sent the functional part of Meridian far away from the command center to hide it from the Opposition, in hopes of returning one day to continue the ""work of renewal.""
At this point the kett have had enough of your interference and launch a major assault, both on the ground and from space. Meridian's defenses are ordered to attack the kett fleet, leaving you to fight off the ground assault.
Eliminate the Archon's Sword and the kett forces[]
Seconds into the scene and already concealing her buddies
The Archon's Sword enters with a wave of Anointed and Chosen. She is heavily shielded, has lots of health, and will cloak and evade when she takes too much damage; fortunately, she won't use cover much and isn't very mobile. When she cloaks, another wave of kett will spawn to provide cover to her.
The second wave is Wraiths and Destined, the third wave is a Fiend and more Chosen. Note:  Despite what the objective states, once you kill Archon's Sword the battle ends immediately. Collect any remains or scan any items before doing so as a cutscene will start immediately upon her death.
With the Archon's Sword dead and their ships taking heavy damage, the kett retreat. Thanks to the Scourge disrupting flight paths, there's no easy way to determine exactly where Meridian itself is now located. There's nothing left to do at the command center, so Ryder and party return to the Tempest."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/AVP_Cryo_Deployment_Perks,"Prerequisite: A Better Beginning
The mission is added to the journal after placing an outpost  on Eos.","AVP represents Andromeda Viability Points . This mission introduces Pathfinder Ryder to AVP mechanics and, upon completion, allows you to access the system from the Tempest control room.
This is a simple talk-to-people and interact-with-things mission. No need to fuss over weapon loadouts.
Speak with Addison on Nexus[]
Find and talk to Addison in Colonial Affairs at the Operations wing of the Nexus to learn about the AVP system. Each action you take to increase the viability of the Heleus Cluster will earn AVP, and at certain thresholds, Ryder will gain a Nexus Level and the opportunity to bring a new group of specialists out of cryostasis.
Speak with Addison's assistant Brecka[]
Addison, the AVP console, and Brecka
After speaking to Addison, talk to her assistant, Vladimir Brecka, standing next to the center console. He can give more information about the AVP system, and will direct you to the AVP Status Control panel nearby.
Spend AVP to gain Perks[]
Access the console to bring up the AVP interface. Notice on the left that there is at least 1 Cryo Point available. Explore the three categories and the perks within, then choose a perk to spend the point on.

Talk to Suvi[]
Dr. Suvi Anwar's plan is to map the Scourge's structure. With the Scourge analyzed, the effect it had on Meridian's path can be determined, which hopefully will lead to Meridian's current location. Cora Harper reminds everyone that the Andromeda Initiative's Heleus charts will provide a baseline, since they show the cluster 600 years in the past. The Tempest must now place probes in the Scourge to determine what's changed since the Scourge appeared.
Scourge clusters probed for data[]
There are seven systems (Civki, Eriksson, Hefena, Kindrax, Rohvir, Skeldah, and Vaalon) with Scourge targets highlighted on the Galaxy Map. Fly to a system, scan for anomalies, and probe the Scourge. Each probed Scourge target awards +270 XP. Any three systems will do. Once the third probe is in place, SAM announces that the analysis is complete. Note:  The remaining 4 systems can still be visited and probed for the XP rewards. This is easy XP and only takes a few minutes to acquire so collect them before continuing on.
Speak to crew about Scourge research[]
Even though the objective says ""Speak to crew about Scourge research"" this isn't what Ryder actually has to do. Ryder completes this objective by using a console behind Kallo Jath on the Tempest bridge with the Scourge data. This starts a cutscene conversation with Kallo, Suvi, and SAM. While they haven't been able to determine the actual position of Meridian, they do have a correction for the Remnant navigation systems. If Ryder returns to the Remnant city (Khi Tasira), gives the corrected flight plan to the Remnant ships there, the ships will fly to Meridian and the Tempest can follow them.
Return to Remnant city in Civki System[]
Note:  This is the point of no return which locks Ryder into the final main plot sequence of the game.
Warning:  Once Ryder visits Khi Tasira, any actions requiring the Tempest will be locked out until after this mission is complete (except for the AVP Status Console and the Respec Station).
Fly to Civki system and board Khi Tasira. SAM has located a tower which can override Remnant ship controls and send them on the way to Meridian. Unfortunately, this section has a separate energy grid from the rest of the complex, and may not recognize Ryder as the Administrator of the station.
Reach control center and reveal Meridian[]
After the cutscene, Ryder will be in a room that looks like a gravity well room from previous missions. There are two lootable containers on the elevated platforms to the south and the east. Once Ryder has collected the containers, head through the door to the west.
The room that Ryder enters has lower and upper sections. As Ryder heads west through the room, the squad will come under attack from a Remnant force of a couple of Nullifiers, Observers, and Assemblers. Defeat them.
After the battle, there are two lootable containers in this room. One is on the lower section nears the Remnant columns and the other container is at the top of the Remnant columns.
Proceed west to the Remnant Console. SAM will comment that the controls are ahead. SAM says that projections indicate multiple launch bays and possible links to Meridian deployment.
Hyperion's surprise guest
Activate the console and Remnant ships will fly to Meridian, which is revealed to be a ""Dyson Sphere"" but moon-sized. SAM indicates that Meridian is a self-contained seed world that once reactivated will affect all of the connected planets. The plan has worked brilliantly... until the Archon congratulates Ryder on this success via the SAM implant.
The Archon is standing in front of the SAM node on the Hyperion. Thanks to accessing Ryder's memories earlier, the Archon knows what he needs to control Meridian, and how to get it. Rather than bothering with Ryder, he'll capture Ryder's sibling, and use that implant to interface with Meridian. And through the SAM link, the Archon now has the location of Meridian too. The Archon now disconnects Ryder from SAM, leaving Ryder injured and barely able to walk.
Struggle to reach door[]
The HUD will stutter and Ryder will take increasing damage approaching the navpoint. As you attempt to return to the Tempest for assistance, enduring the Archon's taunts all the while, Ryder will collapse in front of a closing Remnant door.
The scene switches back to the Hyperion, which has been boarded by kett. Control has now switched to Ryder's twin. SAM informs the twin that Ryder will die unless the twin manually reconnects SAM node to Ryder.
Get a weapon[]
Head to the navpoint to find an Arms Locker. A terminal next to the locker reveals some details of the kett attack.

Open the locker and pick up the Phalanx. Ryder's twin will be awarded an M-5 Phalanx Rank I and an Omni-Blade Rank I.
Fight to communications[]
Head towards the new navpoint in Communications.
There will be a fight with two Chosen once the door opens. Ryder's twin only has Frag Grenade for use as a skill with one grenade. A Hyperion crewman in the room will shoot at the Chosen as well. The Chosen are content to stay behind cover, so just be patient and wait for good shots. When the Chosen are defeated, proceed forward towards the new navpoint (the crewman stays behind), grab ammo and health from the supply caches in the corridor, and continue into a new room where there are two more Chosen.
Captain Nozomi Dunn jetpacks in to help Ryder's twin fight the Chosen. Ryder's twin and Nozomi are higher up and have plenty of cover, so the Chosen will be easy enough to kill. Once the Chosen are dead, head forward with Dunn through several corridors and doors towards a maintenance shaft leading to Communications.
Reach maintenance access[]
Run for the maintenance access[]
Ryder's twin finds Hyperion crew behind a barricade, fighting off several Anointed and Destined. Dunn stays behind to hold off the kett. Joining the fight won't help. Instead, run to the navpoint in the access tunnel and follow it to Communications.
Send Signal To Restore Pathfinder's Implant[]
Inside Communications, Ryder's twin will find a terminal with details of the kett assault on the Hyperion's bridge, and the QEC controls. The QEC Relay can send a reboot command to reset Ryder's implant, which will restore functions which SAM mistakenly took over, and hopefully keep Ryder from dying. Kett arrive at Communications as the twin prepares to send the command.
The scene shifts back to Khi Tasira, where the squad is still trapped behind the closed door and Ryder's heart restarts (that makes three deaths in the game).
Interface to open door[]
When control returns to Ryder, Ryder is hanging off of a Remnant Console. Ryder then unsuccessfully tries to activate the console. Ryder tries a second time to activate the console and the door starts to open but then snaps shut again. Ryder tries for a third time to activate the console and is able to use the console to open the door even without a connection to SAM, although the process is painful and difficult.
Rally your team at the tempest[]
The door then opens and Ryder can enter the next room to find ammo and health caches. Continue towards the navpoint.
As Ryder proceeds through the complex to the Tempest, reports come in of the kett fleet heading to Meridian, including the stolen Hyperion.
Somehow recover Hyperion[]
Continue towards the next navpoint and head through the doorway. In the next room, interact with the gravity well to head down into the complex.
Somehow face the Archon's fleet[]
When Ryder lands from the gravity well, head towards another navpoint behind a closed door. Open the door and a cut scene starts. There's a lootable container on the raised ledge behind the gravity well.
Outside the Tempest the crew debates what options are left, if any. Meanwhile, Ryder walks up to a nearby console and interfaces with it. While the process is, again, draining, Ryder is able to command a Remnant fleet. There's nothing left to do but have the Remnant fleet, and everything else the Heleus cluster can bring to bear, head for Meridian and a final confrontation with the Archon.
Go to bridge to launch[]
Ryder now appears aboard the Tempest. As crew members prepare for battle and talk over comms to the various allies and contacts, Ryder has the option to briefly talk to them. The AVP Status Console and Respec Station are still available, but the crafting, strike team, merchant, email, and SAM terminals are disabled. Ryder's romantic interest, if one is on the Tempest, is on the bridge. Note:  The map may report an incorrect position.
Hyperion dragged by the kett over to Meridian
Going to the bridge triggers a new mission and a cutscene conversation with the love interest. If the romantic interest is not on the ship, or Ryder hasn't romanced one, Cora will meet Ryder on the bridge for a businesslike pep talk.
As the kett fleet approaches Meridian, the Archon is on the bridge of the captured Hyperion, with Ryder's twin and Captain Dunn. As the Archon talks about his plan -- as expected, he'll use the power of Meridian to compel everyone in Heleus to submit to exaltation or be destroyed -- Ryder arrives with the Remnant fleet.
Battle ensues. Kett forces outnumber the Remnant. However, Ryder uses the Scourge's affinity for Remnant technology against the kett, by luring Scourge tendrils using Remnant ships. Note:  How Ryder comes up with the idea differs depending on how much progress was made with the Ryder Family Secrets mission. If the mission was completed, the Pathfinder will flash back to one of Alec's philosophies; otherwise, Ryder will form an idea themselves. Either way, the outcome is the same.
An opening in the dyson sphere
With the bulk of the kett fleet immobilized, the Archon has no choice but to immediately go for Meridian Control. Overriding the twin's implant with his own device, he commands Meridian's outer wall to open and flies the Hyperion through. The Tempest pursues. Inside, the interior of Meridian is revealed to be inhabitable; it's a golden world itself, only inside-out, with artificial gravity holding everything on the inner surface of the sphere. The Archon steers the Hyperion towards the control center as other kett ships fly to intercept Ryder, who drops in with the ND1 Nomad as various allies arrive to help.
Chase the Archon in the Nomad[]
This sequence is highly variable depending on previous decisions and missions Ryder has completed.
Various allies show up to assist Ryder. How many and which allies show up during this mission depend upon Ryder's choices during previous missions.

Whichever person you side with during High Noon will show up as an ally. Note:  If High Noon isn't completed, Sloane Kelly will show up as the ally.
You  must now chase the Archon to the control center in the Nomad. Along the way, various allies can be heard over comms.
Eventually Captain Dunn radios in to tell Ryder that the Archon has left the Hyperion with Ryder's twin, leaving Dunn aboard the Hyperion to crash. Dunn attempts to control the Hyperion's descent as Ryder races on.
Continue in the Nomad until a navpoint appears to alert that the end of the chase scene will be happening soon.
Eventually some sort of EMP effect disables the Nomad near the entrance to the command center, and Ryder and squad must proceed on foot.
Defeat kett guarding the entrance[]
Proceed on foot towards a fight with some Chosen and Anointed, later reinforced by more kett including a Behemoth. Defeat them.
Up on the platform to the right is a large square orange container that can be looted.
Near the burning crashed ship is another large square orange container that can be looted. Note:  The burning fire is a Level 4 Heat Hazard. Take care to not touch the fire during the heat of battle. Remember the location of this crate, you will be coming back here in a bit.
During the fight for the entrance, if Ryder accepted the deal with the Primus during Dissension in the Ranks a new mini-mission and objective will be added. (This will not appear if Ryder rejected the deal.)
Primus: Enemy of my enemy[]
Suvi will come over the comm and inform you that a ship has lost its data shielding and that it's the Primus. Suvi says to access the ground equipment and she will upload it like SAM.
Access the kett console[]
A kett console is now present next to the large orange lootable container you had looted a little earlier. You can now interact with it start a cutscene.
You have the choice to either use the kill code or not use the code.
If Ryder decides to use the kill code
Suvi comes over the comm and lets Ryder know that the kill code was deployed. The Primus' ship thrusters are now failing. Ryder says the Primus gets to look like she was sabotaged and the squad gets an easier run.
If Ryder decides to not use the kill code
Suvi comes over the comm and lets Ryder know that the Primus' ship is pulling away. Reinforcements are now on the way. Ryder says that the Primus holds a grudge but Ryder isn't taking the deal.
Enter Meridian Control[]
After defeating the kett, proceed inside. As Ryder does so, an aerial battle erupts overhead. The other Pathfinders secure the airspace over the entrance. Ryder's allies will secure the entrance, while Ryder heads after the Archon.
Inside the door, a Remnant console activates a gravity well.
Fight to reach the Archon[]
As Ryder proceeds down, Suvi radios in with the news that there's an energy spike ahead; the Archon is up to something. After Ryder lands, there is a lootable container on the elevated platform.
Head down the corridor to the south and glowing blue rotating cubes will erupt from the floor. After two of these appear, a small skirmish with an Anointed and a couple of Chosen will take place. Defeat them.
Defeat defending enemies[]
Ryder emerges into a large open area with a balcony overlooking a catwalk, and a fight in progress between kett and allied angaran and Initiative soldiers. (Apparently they arrived by shuttle; the space is open to the sky on one side.) Melee-oriented squadmates can get themselves into trouble here by charging down to the catwalk, which is full of kett. Keep the squadmates under control or Ryder will end up being the only one alive to kill all of the enemies. Remnant enemies will also appear during the battle. The Remnant will attack the kett and if any are left over they will attack the squad.
There is a lootable container in the northwest section of the balcony area.
Push farther into Meridian Control[]
When all enemies are defeated, proceed down into the central structure.
The path inside seems to dead-end. Use a nearby Remnant console to activate a bridge to the east. Cross the bridge, head south, and use another Remnant console to head back west. To the north is a lootable container. To the south, Ryder will find ammo and health supply caches.
Fight past the kett ascendant[]
When Ryder emerges from the small room, there will be a fight with an Ascendant and several Destined and Anointed. There are multiple catwalks on multiple levels. To the east and the west are small rooms with a lootable container. These rooms are a good place to take cover from the battle. Depending upon which choice that Ryder made during Hunting the Archon, either krogan or salarian allies will intervene here to help.
Push farther into Meridian Control[]
Using the door out of this area triggers a cutscene. The damaged Hyperion is crashing. Captain Dunn reroutes power to the Cryo Bay shielding and orders all hands to go there; the bridge will have to take its chances. The Hyperion crash-lands on the surface of Meridian. If the turian and asari Pathfinders are both present, they will shield the bridge, and Dunn survives. Otherwise, Captain Dunn is killed in the crash. Either way, the Cryo Bay and the other humans aboard survive.
Defeat kett guarding gravity well[]
Head to the south and pass through a door into a large room. Ryder's squad and allies will have to engage kett Anointed, Destined, and Chosen guarding a gravity well, with a Fiend and a Destroyer further in. Unfortunately, this time the Fiend and Destroyer are probably going to fight the squad rather than each other. Try to separate them. Tip: It isn't required to defeat the Fiend and Destroyer. If the squad sticks near the entry door to the room and defeats all of the smaller kett enemies, when Ryder proceeds towards the gravity well and the Fiend and Destroyer spawn, Ryder can activate the gravity well and skip defeating the Fiend and Destroyer.
Enter gravity well[]
When all enemies are defeated, there is a lootable container on the elevated platform above the gravity well. Once you're ready, take the gravity well down.
Reach the heart of Meridian Control[]
When Ryder lands, there is a lootable container on the elevated ledge above the gravity well.
The next section is a Remnant maze full of defenses. However, the defenses are offline, and the maze itself will tell Ryder how to get through; Ryder's twin is apparently helping out.
Take time to look behind small blocks and look around carefully as there are multiple small containers hidden throughout this section.
Follow the maze until Ryder reaches a gravity well. Ryder can then take the gravity well to the side and will land on a long walkway. There are ammo and health caches on the way to a large door lit by orange colored light. Opening the door starts a cutscene.
The Archon and Ryder's twin are nearby. The Archon has hardwired himself into Meridian and is preparing to seize control with the aid of Ryder's twin's implant.
Eliminate kett protecting the Archon[]
The first fight is between the squad and an Ascendant with supporting Destined, Chosen and Anointed. Defeating these enemies triggers a cutscene. The Archon has gained access to Meridian's systems, and activates an Architect and other Remnant in the room. But Ryder's sibling is also connected, and suggests a plan. The Archon is drawing power from conduits in the room. Break those connections and the Archon's control will fail.
The following combat sequence is long. Fortunately, autosaving here is fairly frequent.  It's a step-by-step process, with Ryder's twin guiding Ryder through with navpoints. There are occasions when you will need to double back. It's either because you need to activate a bridge/pillars or wait for your twin to activate the same for you to cross the ferrofluid. The remnants are the only enemies left in the room at this point and they keep spawning all the time. So your goal should be to get to the next Navpoint. Fortunately you have plenty of cover to hide behind or activate tactical cloak if you can. Your companions are now accompanied by the 2 Krogan scouts/Salarian STGs plus more exiles join in a little later led by Sloan/Reyes. If this is the first time you're encountering the Remnant Architect, then it is suggested to review the tactics to fight the Architect here. Although there are ammo and health caches scatters all over the large room, it is hard to spot them due to the multiple obstacles and covers spread all over the place. Hence it is advisable to bring any beam based weapons or those that utilize either the bioconvertor or Vintage Heat Sink  augments.
Kill all Remnant and reach relay[]
Ryder's first target is a conduit on the northwest side of the area. Various Remnant types will intervene to stop Ryder from getting there, and the Architect will open fire occasionally as well, with an Architect's standard area of effect attacks. Kill all of the Remnant enemies to obtain the next objective. Note that you are defending your position once you get to this NavPoint. There is no console to be activated at this location. Your clue to move is when your twin comes on the comms and you get a new NavPoint.
Defend until Sara/Scott exposes interface[]
Head to the navpoint and activate the Remnant console. Unlike your last NavPoint, you have a console to activate before defending your position. Get into cover, kill Remnant until Ryder's twin finishes the hack and makes the console active, so that Ryder can use the console to deactivate the power conduit. Ryder has to stay inside the white circle for the hack to expose the power relay. Since you have to defend your position, you have limited options to save yourself from the Architect's attacks.
As for the Architect, dodge its fire as best as possible. When the Conduit (head) is available as a target -- squadmates should tell Ryder about this -- take it out if possible. (Cobra RPGs would be a good choice). Destroying the head will cause the Architect to cease fire for a little while. The Architect can be temporarily neutralized in this way, but not permanently destroyed. Ryder may end up destroying the head multiple times.
Interface to disrupt the Archon's control[]
Once the hack is complete, interface with the Power Relay console.
Kill all Remnant and reach relay[]
With the first conduit down, the next route will be around the Architect in a counter-clockwise direction -- south, east, and back north. Again, plenty of Remnant will oppose the squad, as will the Architect if it isn't currently neutralized. Eliminate all remaining Remnant enemies.
Find a way across ferrofluid[]
A chasm full of electrical fluid will block progress. Ryder's twin tells Ryder that there's a console nearby; look for it along the west wall and use it to raise a bridge.
Kill all Remnant and reach relay[]
Continuing around to the east side there will be another obstacle; this time a chasm rather than electrical ferrofluid.
Note:  Ryder can get to the navpoint but if the Remnant enemies aren't killed first nothing will happen. This also applies to any objective after this that says to ""Kill All Remnant"".
Defend while Sara/Scott bridges chasm[]
There's no console this time, so Ryder will have to wait for Ryder's twin to raise some pillars. Kill Remnant as best as possible. Cover isn't very good in this area, so Ryder will need to back off from the chasm a bit and wait for the hack. This time there is no white circle for this hack so move as needed to kill Remnant enemies and attack the Architect (if possible).
Kill all Remnant and reach relay[]
Once the pillars are up, wait for an opportunity since Ryder will be really exposed on the top of the pillars. Then cross the pillars and make for the console.
Defend until Sara/Scott exposes interface[]
Head to the navpoint and activate the Remnant console. Get into cover, the remaining squadmates will fly in by shuttle to help out, kill Remnant until Ryder's twin finishes the hack and makes the console active, so that Ryder can use the console to deactivate the power conduit. Ryder has to stay inside the white circle for the power relay to be exposed.
Interface to Disrupt the Archon's control[]
Once the console is active and Ryder uses it, Ryder's twin puts up the location of a final console and passes out.
Kill all Remnant and reach relay[]
Kill all of the remaining enemies and head to the navpoint.
Interface to take Meridian from the Archon[]
Fortunately, the final console is active already. Retrace Ryder's steps to the south and activate the console to end the battle.
With his energy reserves cut off, the Archon is killed by feedback from his own wiring. Ryder is now able to bring Meridian online, and various worlds across Heleus blooming are displayed. (This doesn't actually change viability or activate any Vaults Ryder hasn't activated already, so all those missions are still available.) Ryder, the crew, and Ryder's twin emerge on the surface of Meridian, to be greeted by the rest of the Tempest crew and various allies. A victory speech, celebration, and the end credits follow.
Congratulations, you have completed the main story arc of the game. If you had any side missions or Additional task pending, you will get a chance to get them done a little later.
After the credits, a cutscene shows that the Primus escaped the battle. She's aboard her ship, orbiting Meridian, but departs. Epilogue: Home and Away begins immediately."

This mission is automatically acquired following the closing credits.","When the game resumes after the credits a cutscene with dialogue will play of Pathfinder Ryder getting up from Alec Ryder's computer, and talking with their twin, who's been resting for a while. Your twin has been in a coma for weeks again, and asks what has happened in the meantime: how are the Hyperion sleepers, and how's your own connection to SAM. Respond how you like, as you have to deal with the Nexus leaders outside the room, and your twin goes back to sleep again.
Note:  This mission is the final time your twin is seen or referenced. When you leave and then return to Meridian later, Ryder's quarters will be empty with no sign of the sibling anywhere. If Ryder Family Secrets was not completed prior to the endgame, the story thread involving Ryder's family (particularly their mother) remains incomplete.
Talk with your squad and crew[]
Two tasks need to be completed as soon as you step out of your room on the grounded ark - now known as Port Meridian - for the next objective to be added: choosing the Nexus ambassador and speaking with ten marked  squadmates/crewmates.
Choosing An Ambassador
So deadlocked in squabbling that even leadership decisions are given to the Pathfinder
Jarun Tann, Nakmor Kesh, Foster Addison, and Tiran Kandros want to talk to you once you open the door, they all journeyed to Port Meridian from the Nexus to see Meridian for themselves. Ryder will start by interrupting Addison telling off Tann, and then Tann claims you're late. Whatever your response to this, Ryder will be told they have to nominate someone as an ambassador to the Nexus.
At this point, you can argue that this shouldn't be Pathfinder's choice, but they'll force you to choose anyway, since you are the only one who acted for everyone, Initiative or not. The four politicians can't make the choice using a people's vote, as they cannot impose a vote on the angara, Kadara, or Elaaden. Tann then suggests the salarian Pathfinder, and you will then have to choose between four options:
Moshae Sjefa, the influential angaran leader - Gives the angara a voice, but Kandros argues they have enough of a voice, and Tann recommends that it needs to be more Initiative-focused.
August Bradley, the human mayor of Prodromos outpost on Eos - A good leader and representation of the outposts, but Kesh reasons his leadership experience is on a very small scale. Kandros will approve of how well he protects the outpost (relative to being a military or scientific outpost), despite opposition.
Nakmor Morda, the krogan leader of New Tuchanka - Gives the krogan a voice. Kesh laughs at this while Tann despises the choice and Addison will say it's rather unorthodox. Note: This option is not available if you haven't created an outpost on Elaaden.
Zevin Raeka/Lumont Hayjer, the salarian Pathfinder that represents the future - Good representation of the Initiative's goals, but Addison will comment on how it's not the most inspirational choice, and Kesh just notes how bad the choice is.
Why do I get the feeling they're about to break out into dance
Choosing involves selecting your candidate twice. The first time, the Nexus leaders will give their pros and cons as per above. Selecting another candidate also makes the leaders give their opinions. The second time confirms your choice. Whatever the choice, the politicians will make their comments, then move on. Whoever you choose will later be found visiting Port Meridian the next time you're here and will comment upon being chosen.
Speak To People
A party's going on and everyone's just loafing around
You can now talk to all ten of the specified squad and crew members, in any order. There are also terminals, a few extra people, and other information to glean from the area as well. You can return later on to interact with these items and some of the people. SAM Node is presently off-limits due to integration of Hyperion systems, but will be open again on future return trips.
The ten specific people you will have to talk to are your entire Tempest crew: Gil Brodie, Dr. Lexi T'Perro, Dr. Suvi Anwar, Pelessaria B'Sayle, Kallo Jath, Nakmor Drack, Vetra Nyx, Liam Kosta, Jaal Ama Darav and Cora Harper. If you're in a romance with any of these people, there may be additional dialogue related to that.
Now here's a bunch of guys who can appreciate living a little
Other people you can directly talk to are completely optional. Some of them are permanent Port Meridian mainstays, like Specialist Rynn Gee and the trio of Iora Pillay, Hunter Kerry, and Darla vas Hyperion, and you can pester them on later visits. The rest are only present during this mission, and most are dependent on them surviving something that could have killed them early on: Sloane Kelly, Nozomi Dunn, Zevin Raeka / Lumont Hayjer, Moshae Sjefa (one of the latter two may be present on return trips if selected as ambassador).
Birtak, one of Drack's missing scouts, makes an appearance here even if you saved Raeka at the expense of the other scouts in Hunting the Archon. You can also join in on the dance floor next to Peebee if you feel up to it, though she makes no comment about it.
Next to the exit to the Tempest, you can speak to Specialist Rynn Gee, who'll let Ryder listen to a coded call from the quarian ark Keelah Si'yah, and for some unexplained reason the message is to stay away from where they are.
When you've spoken to the tenth mandatory person, the next objective will be added. You can keep exploring this small section of Meridian, or proceed to the eastern side of the main room to board the Tempest and leave Meridian.
Return to the Tempest to continue exploring[]
Your ride-or-die guys who made exploring Heleus in style possible
When you attempt to leave, Ryder will notice the squadmates conversing together, and the salarian Pathfinder (accompanied by the asari and/or turian Pathfinders if their respective stories have been resolved) holds you up to chat for a bit. Raeka/Hayjer wants to honor what you did, but there is no protocol for it. They instead declare you've defined the Pathfinder role that was invented by Alec. The squadmates converge there, a quick pan of their approving faces ensues, so respond how you will to that.
A short scene on the Tempest bridge follows, where your entire crew (minus Lexi) see the ship off to leave Meridian for other adventures. The mission then completes."
https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/On_the_Frontlines,"Prerequisite: Meet the Resistance
This mission is acquired automatically after speaking with the lookouts Beniska and Tseek as part of the mission chain about angaran trust-building on Voeld.
Note: The name of this mission depends on its type. If it's a Priority Op, this mission is called On the Frontlines. If it's a Heleus Assignment, this mission is called Eyes on the Ground.
Note: It's possible to entirely bypass this mission by immediately exploring Voeld and accomplishing Stage a Rescue directly. In this case, this mission still shows up under the Completed Missions folder in the journal and with both its objectives marked complete. If you haven't talked to the lookouts, the mission text is absent and only the objectives are shown.
Note: In another outlier case, not talking to the lookouts, going to Hjara, then talking to the relevant person there also completes this mission, although with one less objective.","At its core, this is a simple ""go to point B and talk to people"" mission. But because the majority of the Voeld map is already open for exploration, you can do this in two distinct ways: strict adherence to navpoints, or going off-script, at which point you can do anything on the world map (or even go offworld for whatever purpose) as long as you later fulfill the primary objectives below.
Note: You're continuously taking steady cold hazard damage while away from heaters or Forward Stations, whether you're in the Nomad or on foot, so be mindful of looking for those heat sources to avoid freezing to death. It's actually possible to traverse the objective on foot from the Angaran Resistance Base and still have some life support to spare, though it's far more convenient (and quicker) to just drive the vehicle provided for you.
Go to Hjara[]
If this is your first time on Voeld, you can follow the tiny yellow ground lights and navpoints through the mountain pass connecting the Angaran Resistance Base to the valley below. You'll pass the Tempest landing zone on the left, your squadmates will comment on the treacherous descent, and soon you'll encounter a squad of dropshipped kett harassing the Resistance border patrol.
Official cause of death is ""tripped on rocks and fell down the cliff""
The enemy composition is always at least one Chosen and one Anointed, plus optional Wraiths or Destined and possibly more Chosen and Anointed. You're in the Nomad; you can simply ram them if you're in a hurry, or you can go down to personally finish them off for some loot and XP.
After the fight you can talk to one of the angara before driving off again in the Nomad. She's a scout who messed up leading the kett patrol away. She's injured, though she can dispose of the corpses and return to base on her own, and she reckons the kett higher-ups would just assume their patrol got lost in the blizzard.
If you followed the navpoints down the pass, you're likely to run into a scannable mineral for Task: Hitting Rocks for Science, and farther east, a kett camp with numerous soldiers and a dropship that spawns one squad before flying off. Enemy composition always has Chosen, although Destined and/or Anointed may be thrown into the mix.
From this camp's vantage point it's easy to see why the Resistance base remains undiscovered despite its proximity to the main kett base
This camp has numerous explosive materials and dischargeable supercapacitors to play with, so you can leverage shooting them when large clumps of the enemy are nearby. It also has an ammo supply cache and a lootable container near the only available heater in the vicinity. On the large smoking ice column nearby, there's also a lithium mineral node. After this camp, it's smooth sailing towards the objective.
If you wish to go the straight-line route, from the Forward Station near Beniska and Tseek you can actually aim for the next nearest Forward Station on the map and drive the Nomad down the cliff to its general direction. This is within walking distance of Hjara Station, up north. Alternatively, aim for the prominent red blinking lights in the distance. The navpoint adjusts accordingly: instead of directing you down the winding mountain pass it locks on to the station directly. This is also a route relatively free of enemy encounters, and thus a much faster way of reaching Hjara at the expense of any XP or item gains (unless you go out of your way to pick fights).
+270 XP is received when arriving at Hjara Station. Life support replenishes within its boundaries, and your squadmates will comment on the prominent block of ice studied by Hjara's scientists.
There's an Angaran Integrated Tech Node (+100) in the small room behind Janleth, one of the scientists studying the ice, as well as a small container. In the ice alcove due northwest from the room, there's another container near an angara fixing a solar heater. Due northeast from the room next to two large crates is another container. East from the two large crates is another Angaran Integrated Tech Node (+100) and an iridium node. South of this Tech Node and next to two angara and a crate is another container.
Further south past Knoeth, the thin big hunk of metal next to another angara and near an ammo cache is an Infrared Surveillance Device (+10). Down the stairs is an iridium node. Inside the only other enclosed building in Hjara is another Angaran Integrated Tech Node (+100), Communications Equipment (+10), an ammo cache, and an Irritated Researcher who gives the mission Frequency.
Speak to Skeot[]
You find an angara named Skeot arguing with another, cautious angara. He tells Ryder that his uncle Niilj is being held in a kett labor camp, but if he is moved away he may be lost forever. Skeot will give you the navpoint to the camp, setting the next leg of the mission chain Stage a Rescue.

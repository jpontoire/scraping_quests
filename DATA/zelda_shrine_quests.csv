Under a Red Moon is a Shrine quest in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is obtained from the Rito minstrel Kass at Washa's Bluff south of Hyrule Ridge.

Once this is done, a shrine will emerge from the ground nearby."
https://zelda-archive.fandom.com/wiki/A_Fragmented_Monument,"A Fragmented Monument is a Shrine quest in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is a quest given to Link by Garini in the Palmorae Ruins. It involves finding and taking a picture of three monument fragments scattered in the nearby area and showing them to Garini who puts together the passage: ""When the two find their place and kneel in reverence, the shrine will reveal itself."" Crouching on top of one pedestal will prompt Garini to crouch on the other, revealing the shrine.
Initiating the Quest[]
On Palmorae Beach, just east of Lurelin Village in the Faron region, are the Palmorae Ruins up next to the cliff of Cape Cales. You will find two glowing orange pedestals, and a man standing next to a broken-down monument. Talk to him, and he will introduce himself as Garini, and tells you he’s trying to decipher the codes on the monument, but that there are pieces missing. He asks you to locate and document (take pictures of) the broken pieces for him.
Quest Guide[]
There are three fragments to find, and they aren’t terribly far away. If you have trouble finding them, remember that Garini tells you they glow with an eerie blue light at night. Standing on top of Cape Cales is a good vantage point for the farthest two, but the pieces are rather small.
The first fragment you can find by going south from the pedestals, and following the shoreline to the right (west) where there are some crates on the beach. You can find the fragment there, nestled between some rocks in the water.
The second fragment you can find just east of the pedestals, up against the cliff wall, behind a few palm trees.
The last and furthest away is at Soka Point, the very tip if Crepe Cresia. Follow the crescent shape to the very end, and the last fragment will be just behind the farthest palm tree.
Once you have pictures of all 3 fragments, go back to Garini and talk to him. Show him all the pictures, and he will tell you the deciphered message; “When the two find their place and kneel in reverence, the shrine will reveal itself.” However, he admits he doesn’t know what the message means. Go to either pedestal you want and crouch on top of it. Garini will follow your lead and crouch on the other pedestal. The shrine will then surface in front of the fragmented monument."

Even after Link manages to swerve and weave his way through the maze of flowers and complete this Shrine quest, the rules of the Shrine quest are still in effect: Link cannot step on or attack the flowers more than three times without being penalized with a beating from Magda for three Heart Containers.
If Link has a way to set the grass on fire and/or create an updraft, or come down from high above somehow, then Link can easily avoid the flowers and land on the Shrine's entrance point."

https://zelda-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Recital_at_Warbler%27s_Nest,"Recital at Warbler's Nest is a Shrine quest from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The quest is obtained from a young Rito girl named Kheel at Warbler's Nest, just west of Rito Village. Kheel is upset that none of her sisters showed up for singing practice and asks Link to return to the village and tell them to join her. One of the sisters is in the kitchen and refuses to practice until she has eaten some Salmon Meunière. The other three sisters are out getting the ingredients; one is in the Slippery Falcon general store getting Goat Butter, one is singing on a ridge directly above the sisters' home (visible from Akh Va'quot Shrine) with Tabantha Wheat, and one is on the small island just east of town catching Hearty Salmon. After collecting their ingredients, they can be combined in the kitchen's cooking pot to create the Salmon Meunière. After eating it, the final sister agrees to attend singing practice.
When Link returns to Warbler's Nest, the sisters are already practicing a song which proves to be a hint for revealing a hidden shrine. Using a Korok Leaf, Link must stand on the nearby pedestal and send bursts of wind through the five melodic statues surrounding it. Each statue has a number of stalagmites on top of it, indicating which tone that statue is correlated to (one being lowest, five being highest). Once Link is able to mimic the sisters' song using these statues, Voo Lota Shrine will emerge from the ground nearby."
https://zelda-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Stranded_on_Eventide,"""Upon arriving on Eventide Island, a voice spoke of a challenge and then took all of your weapons and armor away. If you offer precious orbs to each of the three altars on the island, the voice has promised to return your things.""
— Adventure Log description
Stranded on Eventide is a Shrine quest in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is automatically given once Link sets foot on Eventide Island in the southeast corner of Necluda Sea. The Sheikah Monk Korgu Chideh challenges him to offer three Ancient Orbs to corresponding platforms across the island. However, the challenge is intensified immediately as the monk removes Link's entire inventory, including all of his armor, weapons (including the Master Sword if he has obtained it), bows, arrows, shields, the ingredients, and cooked food, leaving him with only Key Items he has obtained (Sheikah Slate, Paraglider, Korok Seeds, Spirit Orbs, Saddles, Bridles, and the Champions abilities), Runes, the abilities obtained through freeing the Divine Beasts, and any extra Heart Containers, Stamina Wheel, or inventory upgrades he has obtained up to that point. He also retains upgraded runes such as Stasis+, Remote Bombs+, and Sheikah Sensor+. However the amiibo Rune becomes temporarily unusable preventing Link from using it to obtain weapons, items, armor, or from summoning Wolf Link during the Shrine Quest. Additionally the game cannot be saved while Stranded on Eventide, though the game will autosave shortly before Link sets foot on Eventide thus Link can reload a previous save if he wishes to take on the Side Quest after obtaining more Heart Containers, Stamina Vessels, inventory upgrades, Rune Upgrades, or Champion abilities. Link can also use the Cryonis Rune or the Raft located on the beach in the southwestern portion of the island to leave the island, which will cause Korgu Chideh to ask Link if he wishes to give up on the trial. If Link selects to give up his equipment and items will be returned though he will have to start the Side Quest over again by sitting foot on the island. If he chooses not to give up, Korgu Chideh will return him back to the island.
As a result, Link must rely on his runes, survival skills, and combat abilities to survive the island's dangers. Like ""The Isolated Plateau"" quest at the beginning of the game, Link can obtain items and ingredients by foraging. He can obtain weapons by defeating monsters or finding them in treasure chests. However he has to be careful as he has no armor and there are more dangerous enemies on the island such as a Hinox which guards one of the spheres. Fortunately, Link can use his runes such as Magnesis Rune and Remote Bomb to save his limited supply of weapons and bows. He can also use the Cryonis Rune to lift floating wooden treasure chests containing items. Stasis+ can be useful as it can freeze enemies, allowing Link to flee from them more easily or attack them. The Sheikah Sensor+ upgrade can help Link learn where he might find specific items and help him locate things like treasure chests and Ore Deposits as long as he has added them to the Hyrule Compendium by taking their picture with the Camera Rune. Remote Bombs+ recharge faster and are more powerful, making them more useful in combat allowing Link to save his limited supply of weapons & bows or give him an alternative means to defend himself if he runs low on these items. A Rock Octorok can be found on the southwestern portion of the island, which Link should avoid killing as he can use it to refresh ""Rusty"" equipment he finds on the island turning them into better equipment. Link can find a Rusty Broadsword, a Rusty Shield, and a Rusty Claymore which he can use the Rock Octorok to refresh. Once the challenge is completed, Link's inventory is returned to its former state and Korgu Chideh Shrine emerges from the ground at the top of a mountain on the island. On the hill near the Rock Octorok, Link can find a Bokoblin campsite where he can find a Seared Steak roasting on a spit and a Cooking Pot. The Cooking Pot is invaluable for creating food dishes which can help Link survive on the island and provide better health restoration than raw or roasted food, though Link must be careful as the island has a limited supply of ingredients. Additionally Link can use the Cooking Pot to turn lizards, rhino beetles, and monster parts into Elixirs to provide beneficial effects and health restoration depending on the elixir and ingredients used. However Link must be careful as the camp contains several large Electric Chuchu in addition to Bokoblin, how Link can use them to his advantage by killing them, which will cause them to produce a discharge of electricity that will shock any nearby Bokoblins. In addition to fruits, seafood, and fish Link can acquire on the island, Link can find various wild animals such as Water Buffalo, Woodland Boars, Blue-Winged Herons, and Seagulls which he can hunt for their meat, however Link must be careful not to spook them while hunting and must take care not to waste his limited amount of arrows and bows.
This Shrine Quest technically acts as the main trial for the Korgu Chideh Shrine, as Link receives the monk's Blessing when he enters the shrine instead of another trial thus ""Stranded on Eventide"" is one of those Shrine Quests that functions as an overworld trial where the trial is actually getting to the Shrine itself by completing its Shrine Quest.
This shrine quest also resembles the ""EX Trial of the Sword"" a DLC Side Quest that appears as part of The Master Trials DLC. Both side quests involve testing Link's survival skills by taking away his armor, weapons, and items he has come to rely on forcing him to fight with his runes and items he finds during the quest.
Stranded on Eventide with a Horse[]
Link and Epona ""Stranded on Eventide"" after traveling together there by Raft
If Link can get a Horse onto a Raft and manages make it to Eventide Island (this must be done before the Shrine Quest has been completed), Link can start the Shrine Quest stranded with his horse which remains along with his runes, Champion abilities, Heart Containers, Stamina Vessels, and Key Items. This offers a few advantages as his horse can make traveling around the island easier and can kill weaker enemies by trampling on them, allowing Link to save his limited supply of weapons. It also allows Link to attack from horseback giving him an advantage over enemies. However Link must be careful as his horse can be killed in combat or accidentally.
Master Mode[]
Playing on Master Mode, any enemy with a higher tier gets upgraded, resulting in the player adopting a more defensive manner of combat. Aside from obtaining Octorok balloons and fighting lower-tier enemies to access one of the orbs, the best option is to avoid fighting any group. The, now, Black Hinox, requires you to subtly glide on top of it to claim the orb, as its health is too high for all available weapons to be of any help, especially without an attack buff."

— Stone Tablet
The Three Giant Brothers is a Shrine quest in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is obtained once Link reads an inscription on  near three ancient dias platforms on Mount Taran over looking Taran Pass in the East Necluda region of Hyrule. There are three ancient orbs in the surrounding area, each guarded by three special variants of Hinox. Once all three of the orbs are placed in the pedestals, the quest is completed and the Tawa Jinn Shrine emerges from the ground in between them.
The Three Giants[]
""The ancient spheres guarded by the Mount Taran sentinels shall lead you to the hero's trial. Could the giants who inhabit the area hold the key to unlocking the trial?""
— Adventure Log description
The three Hinox variants are an eponymous Red Hinox called Hinox (Youngest Kin), a Blue Hinox called Hinox (Middle Kin), and a Black Hinox called Hinox (Oldest Kin). Each Hinox has Mount Taran listed as its location above its health meter though the Youngest Kin lives in Hanu Pond, the Middle Kin lives in Uten Marsh, and the Oldest Kin lives in Rabella Wetlands though these areas are all apparently considered part of Mount Taran. Link only has to acquire each sphere and place them in one of the three dias platforms. Link can steal the spheres to avoid combating the brothers altogether if he prefers a stealthy approach or fight them for them if he prefers a more aggressive direct approach. As long as he places the sphere in a platform he will no longer need to collect it though the brothers revive after being slain on a Blood Moon. Beyond their names, the ancient spheres, weapons worn on their necklaces they are no different than the specific Hinox tier they represent. Bokoblins near Hanu Pond and Rabella Wetlands can make fleeing with the spheres difficult though its really only an issue in Rabella Wetlands as the Bokoblins near Hanu Pond  far enough away from the Youngest Kin. Link can tackle the brothers in any order though its best to start with the Oldest Kin as he's the closet and strongest, then the Middle Kin as it removes it from Uten Marsh making travelling through the area with the Youngest Kin's sphere much easier. Its based to save the Youngest Kin for last as its the weakest and Link can simply steal its sphere if necessary after eliminating the other two. The brothers drop food which Link can use to restore his health. There is also a Cooking Pot near a small pond on nearby Firly Plateau where Link can cook food to prepare to confront the brothers."

When Link first arrives at the shrine, he finds Pokki collapsed over its Sheikah Slate terminal in a state of exhaustion from having crossed the desert to find it herself. She despairs that if only she had a refreshing drink, she would be able to complete the shrine's challenge and claim its treasure.
Furosa who runs the Noble Canteen in Gerudo Town, upon hearing that her best customer is in need, informs Link that she can make a very refreshing drink called a Noble Pursuit if he were to bring her some ice from the Northern Icehouse, noting that Anche (the guard) is only active while the sun is out.
Anche, upon hearing that Furosa is in need, willingly supplies Link with a large block of ice which he must then carry south through the ruins leading back to Gerudo Town. This proves challenging as, in addition to the block of ice slowly melting in direct sunlight, the ruins are also infested with Bokoblins and Lizalfos. Once the ice is safely delivered to Furosa (who is graciously waiting at the southern edge of the ruins), she tells Link that he should let Pokki know there is a Noble Pursuit waiting for her at the Noble Canteen.

Navigating through Typhlo Ruins[]
After the unknown voice has issued the challenge of finding the Ketoh Wawai Shrine in the darkness, the entire area is shrouded by a jet-black fog, so dark that not even the Sun is able to shine through this darkness. If Link does not already have a torch before coming to this area, there will be one next to a bird-shaped lantern. Link has two options to work with at this point: he can either navigate the area using the ambient light of Daruk's Protection or pick up the torch nearby and light the bird-shaped lanterns.
Enemies in the Ruins[]
Link is definitely not alone in this area. There are Wolves, Stalkoblins, Fire Keese, Keese Swarms that will come in from the darkness and attempt to hinder Link's progress in finding the Shrine shrouded in the blackness.

Later that night, starting at 22:00, Link would notice that Dorian, one of the gatekeepers of Impa, is walking away from his post and is talking to himself about something relating to the incident. Link keeps a low profile and stealthily follows Dorian to what appears to be a pedestal for an orb. Dorian stops, looking for someone, when he arrives there... While Link moves closer, a Yiga Blademaster reveals himself, and it turns out this is the culprit who had stolen the Heirloom. The Blademaster also reveals that Dorian had joined the Yiga Clan sometime in the past, and he had surrendered his life the moment he left them. The Blademaster is then poised to be rid of Dorian as his usefulness had come to an end, until he notices Link watching from nearby and decides to get rid of Link.
After the defeat of the Blademaster, Dorian then confesses to Link about everything that had taken place before he had become the gatekeeper. Dorian was formerly a Yiga clansman until he had met his wife. Because of this, Dorian had turned his back on the Yiga, married the woman, and had two children with her. All was well until his past had come back to haunt him: the Yiga had ambushed his wife and killed her and they threatened to do the same to Dorian's children, so Dorian was being blackmailed into being a spy for the Yiga Dorian told them everything: Link's presence, info about Kakariko, and likely more. When Dorian felt strong enough in that he was sure he could protect his young ones, he no longer feared them until they threatened the lives of Impa and Paya if he did not do what they said.
Dorian then explains that the Heirloom was the key to the Shrine and recommends that Link use it. When Link does, the Shrine of Lakna Rokee rises from the ground. After this, Dorian then asks Link to keep what had just transpired on this night a secret as he does not want his children, Koko and Cottla, to have to pay the price of his actions. From there on, Dorian pledges loyalty to Kakariko Village and leaves the scene."

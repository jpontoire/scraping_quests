https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Kaer_Morhen_(quest),Prologue,"The game begins in the guest room of the witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen. After being rudely interrupted during bath time by Yennefer's conjuring of a small, insectoid-like monster, Geralt rises from the tub and gets dressed.
The first order of business is to find the key to open the door so that we can leave and go down below. To do this, the game has us activate Witcher Senses. In this augmented vision mode, quest-related items which can be looted or inspected are highlighted in red, whilst other objects which can be looted or interacted with are highlighted in yellow. Activate Witcher Senses and explore the room. You'll be able to inspect the following:
Clothes on the bed
Box of silver jewelry on a bookshelf
Pitcher of juice on the small table
Perfume bottle on a bookshelf near the door
Key to the door on the table by the door
Inspecting those four items will each result in a short conversation with Yennefer. You can talk to Yennefer directly as well, but regardless of what dialogue options you choose she'll tell you to hurry up and go see Ciri for her training.
Collect the key. The locked doors to the west can now be unlocked with this new key, and you may leave when ready.
Walking to the balcony offers an exceptional view of the castle and surrounding countryside. Geralt will also comment on the view.
Lower level[]
As you head down the stairs and approach the bottom landing a cut scene will start. You'll find out that Vesemir has fallen asleep while giving Ciri her lessons on ""Ghouls and Alghouls"" while Ciri has run off to practice her sword work instead of working on her lessons.
Vesemir will awaken and some dialogue will begin with him, Ciri can be seen practicing in the courtyard down below. Afterward, Geralt will go down and speak with Ciri as Vesemir watches.
Dialogue with Ciri begins and at one point Geralt has the option to race Ciri to the courtyard, which will activate the ""Movement Mechanics Tutorial"" if you select the option to ""run the walls"" with Ciri as they talk.
Running the walls with Ciri[]
If you choose to run the walls, you'll need to climb the ladder ahead, practice climbing up a series of ledges and then traverse the platforms and ledges down to the courtyard below. (Be careful to not jump off the ledges - you don't want to die in the tutorial!)
Follow Ciri through a course of ladders jumps and vaults along the ramparts to reach the practice yard. If she wins she will taunt you, however, if you win she'll blame her shorter legs.
Courtyard training[]
The Wild Hunt appears in Geralt's dream
Upon reaching the practice yard Ciri will reveal that she had in fact completed the lesson Vesemir had been teaching before he fell asleep. At this point, Vesemir proposes combat training that you may choose to play through, which will take you through all the basic combat maneuvers including casting witcher signs. Geralt can also choose to skip if you choose ""Let's go straight to free training.""
Following your training regardless if you skipped it, a final cutscene plays where Ciri knocks off the dummy's helmet outside from the castle walls and goes to retrieve it. After a moment, Geralt sensing something was wrong, examines the dummy as suddenly the weather changes and the Wild Hunt appears. The murder of Ciri occurs followed immediately by Geralt awaking from what apparently was all only just a dream.","Use your Witcher Senses to find the key to the bedroom door.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Lilac_and_Gooseberries,Prologue,"Upon waking from his dream of Yennefer and Ciri at Kaer Morhen, Geralt has a short conversation with Vesemir about the dream and on how to proceed searching for Yennefer. When Geralt and Vesemir break camp they are immediately attacked by a pack of ghouls, so take care of them with the silver sword. (250)
Note: at this point you are free to explore an open world. You may follow the quest markers to complete the main quest or go your own way. To unlock other areas you will have to progress the story. The lands are full of side quests and contracts which you may take up at various times. The area is also full of plant life that is able to be harvested for alchemy.
Follow Vesemir[]
Once the area has been cleared of enemies, inspect the area close to the path with a glittering light to obtain the crystal skull seen in the opening cinematic, then saddle up to travel along the main road with Vesemir. Note: You can let your horse steer automatically when you are following a road or path.
A merchant cowers beneath his horse cart while a nearby griffin feeds on his mare
As Geralt crosses the bridge on the opposite side of the Ransacked Village, a cutscene occurs where the witchers encounter a merchant trapped by a griffin. In a short fight, Vesemir is lightly wounded before the griffin grabs the dead horse and flies off. Now free to come out from hiding, the merchant thanks the two before asking if they seek a reward. Geralt may either accept the 50 reward or refuse, in which case the innkeeper at White Orchard will provide him with some free roasted chicken legs.
Mount up again and follow the road into White Orchard, a village that was once formerly part of Temeria but is now under Nilfgaardian control. Enter the inn and talk with the owner, but she'll reveal she doesn't know anything about the woman Geralt is seeking and will suggest asking other travelers instead. At this point Vesemir will take a backseat to tend to his wound, leaving Geralt to handle this on his own.
Ask travelers about Yennefer[]
There are three possible conversations in the tavern marked as objectives. Geralt actually only needs to talk to Gaunter O'Dimm to complete the objective and the conversations may be had in any order.
Mikah and Dromle are the two peasants sitting nearest to Vesemir's table. Selecting the Axii option confers additional details and a bonus 25.
Aldert Geert is a scholar who won't provide any useful information regarding Yennefer but tells an interesting tale and will introduce Geralt to gwent, a trading card game. Talking to Aldert starts the secondary quest Collect 'Em All.
Gaunter O'Dimm - a merchant turned vagrant recognizes Yennefer by the description and tells Geralt that she spoke with the local Nilfgaardian captain before riding off again. During the conversation, Geralt will receive an alchemy item, nilfgaardian lemon. O'Dimm then suggests heading to the Nilfgaardian garrison to seek more information.
Head out to the Nilfgaardian Garrison[]
Note: for achievement hunters, this is an early opportunity to get the Fist of the South Star achievement, so you might want to make a save here. The next fight is one of the easier ones to earn the achievement on.
After exiting the inn, 3 men from a former cutscene will corner Geralt. Using the Axii option would yield a bonus 25 and incapacitates one of the three opponents. Selecting the option to take on just one person will cause the other two to not join the fight until after the first is defeated. Regardless of choice, Geralt will receive the same 350 at the fight's conclusion.
After the fight go to the Nilfgaardian Garrison, located north of the village, and talk to Captain Peter Saar Gwynleve. Note: that on this route (along the river) you can come across the secondary quest, A Frying Pan, Spick and Span which is easy to complete.
On learning Geralt is a witcher, the captain will ask him to take care of the griffin in the area in exchange for information about Yennefer. He will then recommend talking to the hunter, Mislav, about the patrol that was attacked recently, and asking the local herbalist, Tomira, for help finding the bait that is needed to set a trap. Note: Tomira is not available prior to this conversation. Her door will be locked if you try to visit her first. The bait required is buckthorn. A number of these plants are available just off shore next to the A Frying Pan quest location; if Geralt already possesses some, the captain will still direct him to Tomira, but she no longer appears on the map as an objective.
Following this conversation your quest objective will be changed to ""Complete the griffin contract."" and a new quest will be added called The Beast of White Orchard. You must complete this new quest before continuing on with this one.
Prepare to leave White Orchard[]
Once the griffin contract quest is done, meet with Vesemir at White Orchard's inn. In the inn the usual crowd has been replaced by bandits itching for a fight.
Note: once you begin your conversation with Vesemir a sequence of events will activate which takes you away from White Orchard. There are some secondary quests in the area that will fail if you have not completed them before you leave. Also the innkeeper, Elsa, will become unavailable, though the gwent cards she had for sale may still be obtained from Bram if you have not already bought them.
By talking to Vesemir, a cutscene will lead to a group of bandits ambushing Geralt and Vesemir inside the inn. This launches the minor main quest, The Incident at White Orchard, which requires that Geralt kill the bandits.
After the fighting is over, the locals are so terrified that they demand the witchers leave at once. When they do, they're greeted by a Nilfgaardian patrol just outside the inn, who are led by none other than Yennefer, who insists that Geralt follow her to Vizima as the emperor has requested a personal audience with him. However Vesemir, knowing it's better to not mingle with political powers, decides to make his way to Kaer Morhen. (150)
A cutscene will unfold where Geralt and Yennefer talk as they make their way to Vizima, only for their party to be attacked by the Wild Hunt. Yennefer will then destroy a bridge to prevent the Wild Hunt from following her and Geralt to Vizima. The quest will then end, ending the prologue.","Kill the ghouls. (250)
Follow Vesemir.
Go to the tavern in White Orchard.
Ask travelers about Yennefer.
Ask the Nilfgaardians about Yennefer.
Complete the griffin contract.
Prepare to leave White Orchard with Vesemir. (150)"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Beast_of_White_Orchard,Prologue,"While the quest objectives indicate that you must ask the relevant individuals for help locating Geralt's intended goal this is not actually the case. If you happen to know the locations or happen upon the patrol that was attacked or where the buckthorn is growing, you can simply go to those locations. This bypasses some interesting story parts and may affect some side quests so it is not recommended. Note that already possessing buckthorn either in inventory or stash before speaking to Peter Saar Gwynleve skips the objective of speaking to Tomira, while a prior visit to the griffin's nest, or inspection of its site of attack skips dialogue with Mislav.
The hunter[]
Note: If you happened to find Griffin's nest earlier, it is possible to bypass this subquest and continue to the following immediately.
Head to the hunter's hut as marked on the map. Turns out he went out hunting so you'll have to go find him.
Look around near the hunter's front door to find and examine the tracks he left. Follow the tracks in the woods and talk to Mislav, the hunter, when you reach him. You can either tell him you're in a hurry and he'll take you straight to the site of the attack on the patrol or you can help him put down some wild dogs.
If you choose to help take down the dogs you can follow Mislav to a pack. You'll receive typically 9 XP for your troubles in helping to eliminate the wild dogs.
Note: You don't have to actually help kill the dogs. If you stay at a distance and let Mislav shoot arrows at the dogs he will eventually kill them all. It can take a while though as his aim isn't great.
Once the dogs are defeated talk to him again and he can be coaxed into revealing a sad tale of his love life and the fall into ruin of the local lord's house. 350 is received after the conversation, regardless of whether Mislav told his story.
Moving on, Mislav will take Geralt to the site of the griffin attack. Once you're at the site you'll need to examine a few clues which can be revealed to you using your Witcher Senses:
Bottles on the ground indicating a celebration
Camp fire indicating the Nilfgaardians were staying the night in the area
Blood soaked ground indicating there was substantial carnage
Nilfgaardian tracks leading away from the camp

Once you've found the tracks they're pretty easy to follow across the broken bridge and up the hill until you come upon the griffin's nest. Examine the mutilated human body, the bones on the ground, and the griffin's corpse to complete this section of the quest and receive 500 . You learn that a group of Nilfgaardian soldiers killed the female griffin in her nest while she was sleeping. This explains the surviving male griffin's hostility and aggressiveness towards people in the nearby town.
The herbalist[]
Go to Tomira and talk to her. You can also unlock a secondary quest, On Death's Bed, by asking about Lena, the dying girl on the bed that she's trying to treat. The quest requires that you choose whether to give a Swallow potion to possibly save Lena (you should already have one if you are playing on the top 2 difficulties, if not you will have to brew one). Tomira will direct you to the riverbed where the river is the widest to find the buckthorn you seek.
Go to the quest marker and dive below the water. Use your Witcher Senses to find some of the buckthorn that grows on the river bed and collect it to complete this objective.
Note: On the river's edge near where you find the buckthorn is a short side quest, A Frying Pan, Spick and Span, which is convenient to complete at this time. Talk to the old lady standing outside an abandoned hut to start the quest.
Talk to Vesemir[]
Return to White Orchard inn to find Vesemir outside speaking to a peasant about the habits of a local farmer named Boyan. If you haven't spoken to Vesemir since receiving the griffin contract you will have to tell him you accepted a contract to kill the griffin before you can tell him about your findings to setup the trap. He's already picked out a spot to spring the trap, a farmer's field presumably owned by the man named Boyan. After the conversation, meet Vesemir at the objective location to start the ambush cut scene.
Kill the griffin[]
Have a short conversation with Vesemir in which he gives you a crossbow while you wait for the griffin.
Note: Difficulty varies substantially with difficulty level set. If you do the side quest to get the Viper school swords, the fight can be much easier. Make sure to get Swallow and Thunderbolt potions ready. The griffin is vulnerable to grapeshot bombs, hybrid oil, and Aard.
After the cutscene the battle begins. You can use the cross bow to shoot the griffin with a bolt that will make it stop flying and land. Don't hit the griffin directly from the front because it can cause some major damage. Use signs when needed.
After it is down to half health, it will fly to a nearby ridge by the windmill. You can follow it on foot or on horse back. The same strategies apply to the second half of the fight, Vesemir might need some time to catch up if you chase on horseback, however, so be prepared to fight on your own. After the creature is dead, loot it to chop the head off for a trophy.
Collect your reward[]
Go to the Nilfgaardian garrison to turn in the mission. The captain will tell you that Yennefer has gone to Vizima and offers you some coin as compensation for your help. Accept the money (300 +150) or turn down the money (500 ). This completes the quest and continues the main story quest, Lilac and Gooseberries.","If you don't have buckthorn already:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Incident_at_White_Orchard,Prologue,"After finishing The Beast of White Orchard, head back to the White Orchard inn to talk to Vesemir. Note that once you do, this will start a sequence of events where you will leave White Orchard and will fail many of the secondary quests in the area if you haven't finished them yet.
Once you talk to Vesemir, a cutscene occurs as the older witcher notes there are several bandits there itching for a fight, so it's time to go. However, despite trying to avoid an altercation, events play out that causes both witchers to get drawn into a fight. Kill the bandits and soon another cutscene plays out where Geralt and Vesemir are kicked out of the inn, only to be greeted by a Nilfgaardian patrol being led by the very person you've been seeking, Yennefer.",Kill the bandits.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Audience,Prologue,"This quest begins nice enough as you are bathed by several lovely ladies with the wealth and luxury of the Nilfgaardian Empire surrounding you in the capital city of Vizima. Your bath is soon interrupted by Emhyr's chamberlain, Mererid, and his assistant Cledwyn. The chamberlain's exacting standards and distaste for facial hair requires that you have your beard shaved off.
In the middle of being shaven Voorhis walks in and begins to question you and, depending on if you chose to import a save or not, the dialogue will be different here.
If you import a save or chose NOT to simulate one:
Voorhis will simply ask a bit about what happened to his men and you can tell him whatever you wish.
If you chose to simulate a save, the conversation is much longer, where Voorhis will ask a number of questions:
Did you kill Aryan La Valette, during the siege of La Valette Castle? The only effect this has is a slightly different interaction with Maria Louisa La Valette and Molly's status during Broken Flowers.
Did you go with Roche or Iorveth? This has a small effect on a conversation choice during Get Junior, when you visit Roche's camp for the first time.
Did you save Triss Merigold or Anaïs La Valette? (If chose Roche Path)
Did you save Triss Merigold or Saskia? (If chose Iorveth Path)
Note: Triss lives no matter whether you saved her or not. By choosing Roche's path, Saskia will not be cursed but Geralt will not know Saskia's true form, Triss is then saved by Letho. By choosing Iorveth's path the ""optimal"" choice is straight forward, saving Saskia, because Triss lives anyway.
Did you spare Sile de Tansarville? If she survived she'll have a small appearance in The Great Escape.
Did you kill or spare the witcher Letho? If you mention that Letho is dead, Ghosts of the Past cannot be accessed nor will he be available to help during The Battle of Kaer Morhen.
After your interrogation you will be allowed to choose your outfit for the audience from among three not very distinct choices. Loot various bookshelves and chests nearby and pick your favorite outfit to wear. Prepare to learn how to bow (left leg forward, right hand on chest) and greet the emperor.
Meeting Emhyr[]
Once you've demonstrated that you are capable of following directions, follow the chamberlain through the castle to meet the emperor.
Note: There are many containers that may be looted throughout the castle as you see fit, most contain books but there are some manuscripts and useful alchemy ingredients.
Once in front of Emhyr var Emreis you can choose whether to bow or not, resulting in a slight change in the beginning of the conversation. In your private audience with the emperor he proposes a contract for you to find Ciri, his daughter who has recently returned to the area and is being pursued by the Wild Hunt. With the promise of a substantial payment he sends you on your way.
After the meeting you'll continue to follow Mererid through the castle as he comments on whether you choose to bow or not. Feel free to chat with Voorhis in the throne room before you are directed to Yennefer's quarters.
Talk to Yennefer[]
Inside the quarters, ignore ambassador var Attre for now and go speak with Yennefer in the nearby room. She confirms Emperor Emhyr's story and fills you in on her own attempts to locate Ciri thus far. Together you devise a plan to split forces where you'll start your search in Velen by asking for a merchant named Hendrick while she investigates a magical explosion in Skellige. Yennefer also recommends you link up with your mutual acquaintance Triss in Novigrad.
Once Yennefer leaves you can pickup any loot you might have missed, speak to ambassador var Attre for an update on current events, and then depart to get your gear back from the Mererid and finish the quest.","Get dressed and talk to the chamberlain.
Follow the chamberlain.
Talk to Yennefer.
Retrieve your equipment from the chamberlain."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Nilfgaardian_Connection,Act_I,"After collecting Geralt's possessions, walk to the front door of the palace in Vizima in order to fast travel to Velen at the Hanged Man's Tree. If you're up for some gwent, you can play the nobleman in the gardens, though he's tougher to beat than your first opponent in White Orchard.
Go to the Inn at the Crossroads[]
As Geralt rides up to the Hanged Man's Tree, several quests will have been initiated in the journal including: In Ciri's Footsteps, Pyres of Novigrad, and Destination: Skellige. These are all main quests in Act I and thus one can take their time getting to them. For now, follow the marker to proceed through Mulbrydale and across the river to the Inn at the Crossroads.
Note: Along the default route from Mulbrydale to the Crossroads, you will pass the start of two secondary quests: Funeral Pyres and At the Mercy of Strangers. Both quests are fairly quick to complete so this would be a good time to do them.
Ask about Hendrik[]
When Geralt enters the inn he can either go straight into conversation with the Innkeeper to progress the quest or speak with the couple at a table nearby to learn a tidbit about the current ruler of this land he's arrived in. The innkeeper isn't too forthcoming with information about Hendrik and as soon as Geralt sits down to enjoy a drink the inn clears out and some of the Baron's thugs enter. Choose any of the following three options with the associated result:
Back off or die: Causes the baron's men to become hostile and Geralt will be given the objective to defeat the baron's men. Additionally, more thugs will await outside but can be avoided by sneaking out the back door. The innkeeper will be upset that Geralt has caused trouble and possibly brought the baron's attention to their village but he will tell Geralt what he knows about Hendrik. Afterwards, either sneak out the back door to avoid more confrontation with the baron's men or go ahead and kill them all.
I'm a witcher: Causes the baron's men to fear Geralt and they will leave him alone to finish his drink. The innkeeper will thank Geralt for not starting trouble with the baron's men and give up the information needed to find Hendrik. Afterwards Geralt can continue to question the innkeeper to learn some more tales about the bloody baron. However, if players repeatedly attempt to interact with the Baron's men at the Inn immediately afterwards or do any offensive maneuver in front of them, they will turn hostile and the game will proceed as if the player had chosen the first option.
Care for a drink?: This will lead to a second choice and third choice where Geralt can choose to either pick a fight with the same result as option 1 or Geralt can defuse the tense situation leading to the same result as option 2. If Geralt does buy them a drink he won't actually pay any  but some details about this land's current ruler, the bloody baron, can be gleaned from the conversation.
Note: Your actions with the baron's men here will affect how easy it is to gain entry to the Baron's fort at Crow's Perch during the main quest, Bloody Baron. None of your actions will make things impossible later on, but the nicer you are the easier it will be to gain access to the fort. It will also complicate matters at The Pellar's hut during Family Matters if Geralt reveals that he's a witcher to the soldiers outside as they will deduce that he was the one who killed their friends.
Look for Hendrik in Heatherton[]
Not far away from the inn is a town called Heatherton, which has recently been raided by the Wild Hunt. After fending off some rabid dogs attacking a man in the village, the man will tell Geralt what happened to the village and that Hendrik was singled out by the Wild Hunt and tortured for information before being killed.
Go into Hendrik's hut and search his body (particularly his boots) to find a key to the cellar. The cellar door is hidden under an animal skin rug which can be blown off using the Aard sign or by examining it. Once inside the cellar, activate the candle stick on a nearby wall to reveal a hidden trunk with Hendrik's notes which gives Geralt two possible leads on Ciri: the Bloody Baron at Crow's Perch and a witch near Midcopse. The quest will then complete and you can choose which of the two new quests you want to do first.","Travel to Velen.
Go to the Inn at the Crossroads.
Unless you go straight to Heatherton:
Ask about the agent called Hendrik at the Inn at the Crossroads.
If hostile to the Baron's men:
Defeat the baron's men.
Finish talking to the innkeep about the agent called Hendrik.
Look for the agent called Hendrik in the village of Heatherton.
Talk to the survivor and learn what happened in the village.
Find the agent called Hendrik.
Search the agent's hut using your Witcher Senses."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Bloody_Baron_(quest),Act_I,"Arriving at Crow's Perch, Geralt's greeting will vary depending on how he treated the Baron's men in the quest The Nilfgaardian Connection. If he killed them, the townsfolk here will be afraid of his coming and the guards will be hostile and will not let Geralt pass the gate. If Geralt did not kill the Baron's men he should have little trouble convincing the gate guards to allow him to see the Baron. A third option exists where Geralt avoided the Baron's men entirely by not going to the Inn at the Crossroads. In this case, the guards will not trust Geralt but will not attack him, so he will have to either pay 15  or use the alternate entry below.
Forceful Path[]
Head back down the hill into the village near the castle. When Geralt enters the area marked on the map he will spot an old peasant sitting on some wood. Geralt can choose to talk to the man or continue searching for another entrance without his help. Even after starting to talk to the old man Geralt can decide to find the entrance on his own.
I'm too old to scuttle away
Ask the old man if he knows the area well to find out if there is another way into the castle besides the main gate. The man reveals that the innkeep at the crossroads where you fought the Baron's men is actually his sister's husband. In addition, the old man suggests Geralt make a monetary donation in exchange for information about sneaking into the castle. Either pay the man 15  or refuse to pay and find the entrance yourself. If Geralt chooses to pay, the old man will tell a story of a boy found drowned in the moat near the castle. Later his missing hat was found beside the well inside the castle walls which meant it was likely the boy fell into the well meaning there might be a passage between the well and the river. He will explain how to get to a shrine that was made for the dead boy on the northwest side of the castle.
Follow the old man's directions, the objective marker, or simply go to the location marked on the map in the gallery to reach the shrine and search the area on the opposite side of the moat from the shrine to locate the hidden cave entrance.
Note: The cave is very dark inside and you will have to defend yourself. It is recommended that you use a Cat potion to help see better. Additionally there are several containers with good loot in the cave, be sure to check below the water's surface for some loot containers. One of the chests in this cave is associated with the quest Scavenger Hunt: Wolf School Gear.
Dive under the water to enter the cave and explore it to find the entrance to the well, making sure to watch out for the water hag that spawns here. Immediately upon exiting the well a cut scene will occur that will introduce Geralt to the Baron and start a conversation.
Peaceful Path[]
If Geralt is able to enter peacefully, follow the sergeant as he leads through the castle grounds. Geralt may choose to ask about his service in the war and how his men are faring thus far. He will lead Geralt to the garden where the Baron is speaking to Havart var Moehoen.
Talk to the Baron[]
Whether Geralt entered peacefully or forcefully, the Baron greets him joyfully enough, asking Geralt to join him in his chambers. Inside, choose whichever dialogue you want and eventually the Baron will reveal how he met Ciri, who appeared exhausted, wounded, and soaking wet. The quest concludes here and Ciri's Story: The King of the Wolves begins....","Go to the baron's castle.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Ciri%27s_Story:_The_King_of_the_Wolves,Act_I,"With the banks of the river being too steep to climb, there is no choice but to follow the river bed. Soon, Ciri comes across a pack of three wolves below a tree branch on which sits a petrified little girl named Gretka.
Note: Gather whatever alchemy ingredients you can find, you will need some of them later in the quest.
Dispatch the wolves and Gretka will join Ciri on the ground. When questioned on why she's out there, Gretka tells a story of how she got lost following the trail of treats which seems to be a nice way of saying that she was sent away from her family because they could not afford to feed her. Gretka will also mention that she cannot return home because the Wolf King will not let her, foreshadowing a coming fight. Feel free to comfort the girl and then move along, following Gretka as she leads the way home.
Further down the path another pack of wolves are spotted, which will cause Gretka to go hide in some nearby shrubs while Ciri fights no less than six wolves that had been feeding on a cow carcass. Thankfully the wolves won't attack Gretka, so you can focus on just taking out the pack. When they're defeated, Ciri will call Gretka out of hiding and continue down the riverbed.
The pair soon encounters half of a small boat and the remains of a mangled corpse from a recent attack by an unknown monster. Ciri will order Gretka to stay back while she conducts a closer inspection of the body.
The eyes - bloodshot and moist, he died recently
The head - his lips are parted and bloated; he bit through his tongue
The chest - crushed, with ribs piercing the fellow's lungs
The leg - something gnawed off one of his legs
The belly - the liver is missing
It is important to inspect the chest, legs, and belly to conclude that these wounds were made by a werewolf. If not, then Ciri will incorrectly conclude that it was a fiend that caused the wounds. Depending on the conclusion Ciri will either prepare the correct or incorrect sword oil for the coming fight, making the fight less or more difficult.
1 × Dog tallow
1 × Wolf's liver
2 × Fool's parsley leaves
3 × Wolfsbane (will be 3 × Mistletoe if wrong oil is being made)
Gather these ingredients and follow Gretka where you encounter a third set of wolves. Once all the ingredients have been gathered Ciri will make a small camp fire near the mangled corpse to prepare the oil. Once all is ready, follow Gretka into an ominous looking cave and a cut scene will start, showing the King of the Wolves: a werewolf about to attack its next victim.
Kill the Werewolf[]
This is a minor boss fight where you fight the King of the Wolves, but fortunately Ciri may have come prepared. If Ciri did not gather all the ingredients before entering the cave the fight will be slightly more difficult. If Ciri mistakenly gathered the wrong ingredients and created the wrong oil, when struck the werewolf will use a skill called Full Moon, causing it to increase in size and become a stronger enemy.
At the conclusion of the fight, Ciri can speak with the unidentified man she saved from the werewolf, who will identify the body previously examined as being that of Yaren, a local villager who was returning from Midcopse. This man will then take Ciri to the Baron's keep in Crow's Perch in hopes of a reward but will be flatly rejected.
The flash back ends here and returns to Geralt and the Baron. The Baron informs Geralt he let Gretka stay and help out in the kitchen as it'd have done no good to send her back home to a starving family. However, when it comes to information on Ciri's whereabouts, the Baron refuses to reveal more until Geralt can help him track down his own wife and daughter. No matter the choices in dialogue the results will be the same. The quest ends here and the next main quest, Family Matters, begins along with the secondary quest, Ciri's Room.","Follow the riverbed and find help.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Family_Matters,Act_I,"The Baron is a tough negotiator and won't give Geralt any more information about Ciri until his wife and daughter are located. Geralt's first stop is the bedrooms as they went missing in the middle of the night. When the Baron agrees to let you search the two rooms (his own and his daughter's) follow him upstairs while listening to his joke about his daughter.
Search the Rooms[]
Use your witcher senses to find items of interest in the rooms. To progress, you just need to search the Baron's chamber, but searching Tamara's can provide more details and background story.
Baron's room


Wooden Candlestick
Fresh Flowers
Wall Off-Colored
Picture of Baron and Wife
Wardrobe Behind Painting
Wooden Pillar near desk
Return to the Candlestick


Tamara's room (optional)


Ugly Doll
Letter to Tamara
Incense and an Old Key
Once all the clues have been found, follow the scent of the wine down to the first landing to find a talisman hidden under a floorboard.
After locating the incense, follow the scent of saffron down to the bottom floor of the castle into a locked back room where there is a secret altar to the Eternal Fire. Examine the coals and read a small prayer that appears to be written by Tamara.
Talk to the Baron[]
Take the talisman back to the Baron and question him about all that has been found. He'll tell Geralt that he made the doll with his own hands, he was drunk the night his wife and child disappeared so he doesn't know anything about a fight, and he may have spilled the wine on the landing himself. When asked about the talisman he will respond that he doesn't know where it came from, but if there's anyone his wife would seek for something like that, it would be a Pellar living near Blackbough. (150)
Find the Pellar[]
Head to Blackbough and find the Pellar's hut nearby the village at the point marked on the map. As you near his home, some of the Baron's men will be outside, angry about a treatment gone bad that the Pellar handed out to one of their friends named Edric. There are a few options for dealing with the men:
Use Axii (requires Delusion Level 2) gives 35 
Geralt can inquire what they want and can choose to offer a cure to their friend's ailments (Note: If you chose to kill the Baron's men at the Inn at the Crossroads the men will ask who you are and will attack when you tell them you are a Witcher.)
Try to bribe them, but they will not accept payment
Fight or die
Once Geralt has dealt with the men outside the hut, knock on the door to start a cut scene. The Pellar will claim to have known the witcher was coming to save him and he'll recognize the talisman he made for Anna Strenger. He'll claim to be able to help locate Anna but, to do it, he needs his goat back. Guess who has to go and find a goat now? That's right, Geralt. This triggers the quest, A Princess in Distress.
Note: If you refuse to help find the goat you will be given an objective to ""Agree to help find the missing goat..."" There's apparently no getting around this one.
Once Princess has been returned to the Pellar he will perform the ritual augur and informs Geralt that Anna was pregnant and had miscarried, owing to the abuse she'd suffered at the hands of the Baron. The ""dead"" baby was then buried and became a botchling. The Pellar tells Geralt that he has two options:
Remove the curse from the botchling by burying it under the family's threshold and giving it a name using the ritual of Aymm Rhoin, an elven ritual of naming
Find and kill the botchling and bring its blood back to the Pellar, who will then be able to use the blood of kin to locate the missing women
Before heading out, read the new bestiary entry about botchlings to learn more.
Head back to the Baron[]
The stables are alight!
Head back to Crow's Perch to confront the Baron. As Geralt approaches the castle he'll notice there's a huge fire raging near it. When you get close to the area of the fire, the witcher will be told that there are horses and a stablehand (Oswin) trapped in the stables.
Note: It is purely optional for you to rescue the stablehand. If you do choose to save him, you will be rewarded later with 20 .
If you wish to save the stablehand, race over to the stables and climb the exterior ladder to reach the hay loft. Have Aard ready to cast in order to remove debris that blocks the path. Climb down the ladder into the barn proper to find the scared stablehand and the horses. He'll say that the roof has caved in and he can't open the stable door. Head to the main stables door and open it to save the man and his horses.
When approaching the baron (or after a cut scene if you rescued the stablehand), Geralt will have to defend himself from the aggravated and obviously drunk lord in a fistfight. Quickly put him down (50) and afterwards you'll get the real story about his wife's miscarriage, his constant domestic abuse, and anger management issues.
Inside the baron's chambers respond in whatever way feels right as it will only affect the baron's verbal responses. The baron will reveal how he found the stillborn and guess that it was his drunken abuse that led to his wife's miscarriage. Offer him the two choices on how to deal with the botchling and he will plead for Geralt to lift the curse instead of killing it. You can then choose to start the next portion or wait and come back here.
Once you agree to start the next part, the two will wait for midnight, then the baron will lead Geralt out to where he buried the fetus. However, the grave is empty and the botchling appears. You have a timed reaction here to make your choice: lift the curse by making it a lubberkin or kill the botchling.
Note: Your choice here will affect how you complete this quest but will have minimal impact on the Baron's storyline overall.
Lift the Curse[]

If Geralt chooses to lift the curse, the Baron will pick up the botchling and the witcher will be tasked with protecting him all the way back to the manor. While walking back, in two spots the botchling will start to wriggle and a collection of wraiths will attack. They're easy enough to deal with, but make sure as soon as they've been dispatched to cast Axii on the botchling, otherwise it will become enraged, thus forcing the witcher to kill it and go the opposite path.
Upon reaching the threshold, another cutscene will play out as the Baron names the child Dea and Geralt takes him through the incantation to lift the curse. With the curse lifted Geralt may choose to continue on elsewhere until a day and night have passed, or may sit and wait until the time when the lubberkin will appear. (150) When the time has come, a lubberkin will rise as a spirit from the grave and will fly off, showing Geralt the trail of Anna and Tamara.
Don't worry about it getting too far away as it will wait for Geralt to follow. You will have to deal with a couple of drowners before reaching its first stop - a smokehouse just outside of Crow's perch. Search the area for a few clues: clothing, a bracelet, and a horseshoe. When you're done examining, the lubberkin continues on, and you may encounter a couple of endrega workers on the way to the next location.
It will then lead you to an eviscerated and decapitated horse carcass - Anna's horse - but it is guarded by multiple rotfiends. After getting rid of them, examine the corpse and listen to the grim conclusion about what could have done this. The clues include: bones, the saddle, ribs, head, and a missing horseshoe.
Note: This horse corpse will be here even if you haven't started the Family Matters quest yet. You won't be able to search it though, unless you chose to lift the curse.
The lubberkin will then lead Geralt to the final location: a fisherman's hut.
Kill the Botchling[]
This sequence of this quest is triggered by either deciding to kill the botchling outright or taking too long to pacify the creature when it begins to squirm in the Baron's hands. Geralt will have a decent amount of time to calm the botchling so it usually isn't a surprise when it becomes enraged and he is forced to kill it. Once enraged it cannot be pacified and must be killed. At some point wraiths will appear as well, take care of them before focusing on the botchling, even if it regenerates to full health in the meantime. Tip: The botchling is vulnerable to cursed oil and Axii sign. When it drops below half health the spikes on its back will protrude further and it will begin regenerating health. Hit it with Axii to stop the health regeneration and retract the spikes.
With the botchling dead, the Baron will admonish the witcher for killing his child. Geralt will then gather a vial of blood from which he hopes the pellar can use to help find Anna and Tamara.
See the Pellar[]
Head to the pellar's hut and give him the botchling blood. Luckily, he has all the ingredients necessary to perform the ritual and you can start immediately if you wish. When ready, follow him into the woods and fight off wolves on the way to the destination. He will lead Geralt to a location known as the Wolven Glade where he will conduct the ritual. Once at the correct spot, the pellar will explain a bit about the ritual to be performed which will require a bit of work from Geralt.

Light the three braziers when ready to begin the ordeal and time will fast forward to midnight. Ensure Geralt has full health and is ready to face several wraiths. During the ritual a wind will whip up a flock of black birds that will snuff out the fires in the braziers, thus breaking the circle of protection. When this happens wraiths will enter the circle and Geralt will have to fight them off. Relight the brazier as quickly as possible to keep more wraiths from entering the circle. You don't have to actually kill the wraiths, but if a couple break into the circle it's even harder to keep the rest out. Expect to relight the fires three times.
Tip:​ Position yourself close to the fires so that they can be re-lit quickly. Use Igni as an interaction rather than a sign to light the fires, this will not consume any stamina thus making the fight a bit easier.
After the ritual is complete, ask the pellar about the visions he had, some of which appear to reference Geralt's own quest to find Ciri and the destruction the Wild Hunt has wrought upon the land. He will tell the witcher of a fisherman named Voytek, who Geralt suspects may have provided shelter to the missing women. You can then choose to walk the pellar home (100) or leave him to find his own way. Now follow the objective marker to the fisherman's hut to learn what happened to Anna and Tamara.
The fisherman's hut[]
Note: this is where the two routes merge.
Regardless of which method led you here, you just have to enter the hut and talk to the people inside. They'll tell Geralt how Anna was carried off by a beast, having been attacked on the journey, but Tamara is safe and well in Oxenfurt. (300)
Talk to the Baron[]
Return to Crow's Perch to speak with the Baron regarding what Geralt has found, or optionally go to Oxenfurt to locate Tamara.
Note: If you talk to the Baron first before searching for Tamara, he will run after you with a doll to give to her, making for an emotional conversation when you find her. But more imporantly, he'll give you a border pass for an easier entry into Oxenfurt.
If you've already completed A Towerful of Mice by this point, the pellar will talk to you as you near the armorers to give you the side quest, Forefathers' Eve. Then, if you saved the stable hand earlier, he will stop you to give a bit of coin as thanks right after the archway.
You'll notice that the marker is directing you to the garden area, where the sergeant will stop to ask Geralt what happened on the night he and the baron dealt with the botchling, but Geralt won't reveal it. Now head into the garden to talk to the baron. He'll eventually lead Geralt to his office and start the next part of Ciri's story, The Race. If you haven't found Tamara yet, he will then ask you to do that before he reveals anymore information.
Find Tamara in Oxenfurt[]
Note: this objective can be skipped, in which case Geralt won't be able to learn Tamara's side of the story. If that's the case, one won't meet her unless they do Return to Crookback Bog.
Head to Oxenfurt to speak with Tamara. Using the most straightforward route, you'll likely trigger the Thou Shalt Not Pass side quest and will need a pass to enter. If you don't have one, just swim across the river.
Geralt meets Tamara and Graden
Once in the city, follow the marker on the map to find the house Tamara is hiding in. She will come out and be very curt initially, but once Geralt explains he just wants to make sure she's fine, she'll open up about her life at the hands of her father. She is adamant that she won't go back to him and instead, thanks to the help of the leader of the Eternal Flame, has organized a band of witch hunters to go and find her mother and save her. Note: it has little bearing on the conversation if you found Anna already.
A witch hunter named Graden will eventually interrupt, who you can converse with for a bit before ending the conversation. If you talked to the baron beforehand, this is when Geralt will bring up the doll, but Tamara doesn't care. Graden and Tamara will then leave, finishing this part of the quest for 150.
Talk to the Baron[]
Return to Crow's Perch yet again. The Baron will be disappointed that Tamara will not return home but he demands that Geralt find his wife in order to get more information about Ciri. This quest cannot be progressed any further until Ladies of the Wood is completed, which has several prerequisite quests of its own.
Note: This will be the last time that Geralt will be able to obtain the Baron's gwent card. At the conclusion of the conversation below, the Baron will no longer be available to play gwent. However, as of Patch 1.20, his unique card can be retrieved from a box in his office when this quest is completed.
Note: If you talked to Tamara and found Anna before returning to the baron, you must tell him about Tamara first, otherwise, when you tell him where Anna is, a series of conversations happen, preventing you from telling him about Tamara.
Alternate main quest cutoff point: Once you ask the Baron about his last Ciri story (Ciri's Story: Out of the Shadows), the small quest A Mysterious Passenger will no longer be available. This happens after you tell him that you've found his wife, but (at least with recent patches) there's a separate conversation option to trigger it.
After completing the Ladies of the Wood, Geralt must travel back to Crow's Perch to tell the baron of the news regarding his wife Anna. If inquired, the baron will tell the downward spiral of their relationship: how he was constantly away as a soldier and started to drink too much even when he was home with Anna, his wife's infidelity, how the Baron killed Anna's lover when he discovered their relationship, and Anna trying to kill him for it, which marked the point in their relationship where things turned abusive. This will give 300.
When the witcher tells the baron of the pact that Anna made with the Crones he will immediately decide to march on the bog and retrieve his wife from the crones' clutches. At this point you can exit the conversation if you wish to put the quest on pause, but the next step is to remind the baron that he must still tell you about where Ciri went after leaving Crow's Perch. This starts the quest, Ciri's Story: Out of the Shadows, and will point Geralt where to search next.
The Baron then makes one final request of the witcher: help him save his wife from the Crones in Crookback Bog, giving the secondary quest, Return to Crookback Bog. Before the witcher can depart however, a small and incredibly ugly creature bursts into the room babbling on in a nonsensical language. When asked, the baron explains that this creature is named Uma. Afterwards, the quest will complete. (200) Note: If Geralt has completed the main quests in Novigrad and Skellige already, the main quest Ugly Baby will begin before the baron leaves.","Follow the baron.

Follow the marker into the wooded area behind the pellar's house and, as you reach the center of the yellow area, wolves may appear and attack. Once taken care of, look for the goat's tracks or use Witcher Senses to hear the goat's bleating. When you see the goat, approach slowly, ringing the bell when you're within about ten feet or so.
Bring the goat to the pellar[]
Princess will follow Geralt for a time until she becomes distracted by something yummy to eat. When she does this, ring the bell again to call her.
Alternatively, Axii can be used on the goat and, provided that the sign is re-applied immediately after it wears off each time, Princess will not wander off. This would prevent the encounter with the bear that would otherwise occur. However, this method is rather time-consuming since the goat will move extremely slow while under the effect of Axii.
""Bear! Bear! Run you stupid piece of shit!""
As you start to get close to the pellar's hut, Princess will suddenly run off in the other direction, provided you aren't trying the above method. Follow her to find a bear that thinks the goat would be a good snack. Defeat it to continue on. Note: you can take out the bear beforehand, thus keeping Princess free from harm.
With the bear defeated, all that is left is some walking and a bit of bell ringing to bring Princess safely home to her master. Speaking to the pellar with Princess nearby will end the quest and return to Family Matters.","Find the pellar's goat using the bell and your Witcher Senses.

Respond to questions however desired. After a bit of joking around Ciri challenges the baron to a horse race and the baron accepts, declaring that the race shall begin the following morning. The scene ends and the next morning the two are mounted and ready to begin a simple horse race.
Race along the path indicated on the map; it is fairly easy to win although the race's outcome has no effect. Once Ciri reaches the finish line, the two riders exchange congratulations when a loud scream is heard and a basilisk swoops down.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Hunting_a_Witch,Act_I,"Find the witch on your own or ask about her[]
Geralt can either learn the location of the witch by listening to the villagers of Midcopse or going directly to the witch's home. There are a few specific villagers that Geralt can speak to, and this is best accomplished during the day as most people are asleep and unresponsive to questioning at night. There are 3 ways to find the witch's location:
Two peasant women near the village well are gossiping outside a house in front of a small fire. Geralt can eavesdrop on their conversation, but if he gets too close they will quiet each other until he walks further away.
An old man smoking a pipe near the western entrance of the village will quickly offer up the witch's location.
One peasant woman who can usually be found outside her home sweeping near the village well mentions a witch. If asked, she will direct Geralt to speak with her husband who recently went to visit the witch to cure a bad back injury. Approach the husband near the rear of the house, but he won't give up the information easily, so either pay 50  or use Axii (requires Delusion level 1, 25) to loosen his tongue and he will describe the trail to follow. If you do neither and exit the conversation while moving a short distance away (outside the back fence at least), he'll eventually leave the village and you can follow, then rescue him when he is attacked by a pack of 5 nekkers and he will offer directions to the witch out of gratitude. While it can be hard to trigger him leaving the village, like with the other residents, it is recommended to do this early in the day so that he has time to walk there before nightfall.
You can even do all 3 if you wish, being successful in one method doesn't prevent the others from triggering.
Find the trail[]
Map to Witch's Hut
Search just north of the village for the pond and the road that runs along it lengthwise. After reaching the northwestern tip of the pond, a large rock should be visible, standing tall just a bit further to the northwest. This boulder marks the start of a path off the main road to the right which Geralt should follow to an abandoned cart that's usually guarded over by a pack of 5 nekkers. The witch's hut is straight on down the path.
Talk to the witch in her hut[]
As Geralt approaches the witch's hut, he sees a large group of villagers asking for her help. After giving them instructions, she then tells them all to leave as she is done helping people for the day. Obviously the rules don't apply to Geralt so go ahead and barge right into her home. Inside, the witch appears to be missing. Search about the place to figure out where she's disappeared to. Some things Geralt can come across include:
Ordinary ointment
Normal candles
Quite a collection of books
Valuable looking bauble
Witches robes
Chalk pentagram
Skull with inscribed symbols
Mystical underground cavern
Reaching for the skull, it will glow with power and open up a portal to an unknown location. So that's where she disappeared to. Walk into the portal and Geralt will be transported to an underground cavern complete with grass, shrubs, trees, and a large rabbit population. Approach the building in the center of the cavern and Keira Metz, the witch, will call out to Geralt to ascend the stairs to come see her. Hurry up the steps to be greeted by a ""pleasant view.""
Talk to Keira about Ciri[]
Speak with Keira to learn about her dealings in Velen and other sorceresses of the lodge. Keira will tell the witcher that a masked, elven mage had been asking about Ciri and that if Keira met her, to lead her to him. Keira offers to bring you to meet this mage, who is hiding in some elven ruins in the southwestern wilderness just northwest of Byways. You can choose to go straight away with her or agree to meet her there. Note that the meeting place is quite far away, with no safe fast travel points nearby, and possibly nasty enemies on the way, but you also shouldn't go unprepared.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Wandering_in_the_Dark,Act_I,"If you didn't head out immediately with Keira, make your way to the elven ruins, otherwise you'll arrive at them with Keira. There's a chest above the entrance that you may want to loot for random diagrams before going in. Follow her into the ruins where, just after you pass the second archway, Geralt will see members of the Wild Hunt on the other side of the cavern. Needing to catch up to them quickly, he asked Keira to open a portal to the other side, but it goes wrong and the two are separated.
Note: If Geralt ignores the portal he will remain in the main chamber and will begin his search for Keira from there. This may be preferable to going through the portal as you will otherwise be teleported to a cavern far from the main chamber and you will have to fight drowners and foglets to get back to it to find Keira.
Find Keira[]
If you did go through the portal, take out the drowners then make your way through the underwater tunnel (a chest here has a random diagram). The path will eventually split: the left will take you out to the main chamber where some drowners are and the right will as well, but you'll have to fight a foglet prior to the main chamber.
Rats Nest
Once back at the area before you took the portal, head to the right, then right again to find Keira calling for help while casting spells. Apparently she's not a big fan of rats. Destroy the rat nests with either bombs or Igni to receive 100 for each destroyed nest. Keira will explain that there is something distorting her teleportation and demand that they leave the caverns. Use any dialogue option to convince her to stay and pursue the Wild Hunt.
Explore the Elven Ruins[]
Continue the search to find a morphotic projection from the elf. Geralt's knowledge of Ciri's sword name, Zireael (elven for ""Swallow"") allows him to figure out they need to follow images of a swallow. Continue onwards to enter a cavern that appears to have once been a port, where you'll have to fight 4 wraiths among poisonous clouds.
Note: You can disperse the toxic clouds made by the mushrooms native to this cave using either Aard or Igni, the latter causing a large explosion of fire. However, before the wraiths are dead, it is safer to stay near the stairs and let Keira attract them there.
If you're looking for diagrams, go into the underwater tunnel to the left of where you entered (marked with an octopus/kayran). There are 2 separate chests in the tunnel that each spawn a random diagram, and the chest on the other side of the tunnel spawns 2 more (just beware 4 wraiths will spawn once you interact with this one). There is also a chest in the dead end tunnel across from where you entered the cavern with a random diagram.
Once you've explored and looted everything, head to the right tunnel to find a swallow painting and follow the path to eventually find another projection. (100) This projection makes a reference to Kelpie, a sea monster and the name of Ciri's horse. There are two symbols nearby, one of a dog and the other of a kayran. The dog symbol will cause an explosion when activated that will damage Geralt and the kayran symbol will summon a pair of wraiths disguised as clones of Geralt and Keira. The kelpie symbol is below, in the octagonal pool, so Geralt will have to jump down into the pool to investigate. Bug: Sometimes the player will not be able to dive in, requiring a reload. Follow the clue and find another horse symbol after passing through a flooded passageway. The second symbol activates a door in the main chamber where Geralt left Keira.
Rejoin the sorceress and head through the new passage to find an inactive portal that was the reason Keira's portal didn't work. Activate the swallow painting and head through the portal to a new area where a golem awaits.
Keira does a decent job of stunning the golem, keeping him at bay if Geralt needs time to heal or regenerate stamina. Elementa oil or dimeritium bombs are most effective against the beast. Once the golem is defeated, continue up the stairs and the down the passage. Once done, be sure to loot the chest to the left of where you entered and the chest right after you climb up the scaffolding.
Eventually the path will split: the first doorway on the left will lead to another portal which will teleport Geralt and Keira to the other side of the bridge, while the right will eventually lead to a cavern with a gargoyle. Note that just before this room is a chest that will have an oil recipe, that is often for elementa oil and up to 2 other random diagrams. If Geralt goes here, the door will close behind him and a gargoyle will appear that must be defeated to escape the room. There is some loot in this room, so it might be worth fighting it, even though it is optional.
Note: The gargoyle is weak to the same things as other elementa, like elementa oil and dimeritium bombs, as well as Quen sign.

Rush to catch up to the Wild Hunt to find the cave guardians frozen by the riders. The duo catch up to the Wild Hunt, only to have their navigator open three portals to the White Frost, causing a blizzard.
Keira will shield Geralt as the two walk through the room. Geralt must protect Keira from Wild Hunt Hounds as she closes the portals. Up to 15 hounds (depending on difficulty setting) in groups of two to five will spawn from each portal as the pair work through the room closing them. Stay close to Keira, as the white frost is very damaging and Keira can easily be swarmed with hounds if left alone for too long. To close the portals, another solution is to throw dimeritium bombs, or cast Yrden close enough to the spots as you walk - doing either will prevent the hounds from spawning and the portals will be closed directly after Keira Metz' spell. Once the last of the portals is closed, Keira lowers the shield and nearly faints in Geralt's arms. You receive 100 at the completion of this objective. Geralt will then have two timed dialogue choices:
Just don't faint on me - will increase Keira's romance level with Geralt
If you can't go on - will not increase Keira's romance level with Geralt
The way ahead is blocked, but Keira will open the way into the next room. Head through, where you can find a partially blocked side passage ahead. Use Aard, then go inside to find a couple of loot chests and a foglet (the second chest tends to have a random diagram). Now go back to the main tunnel where ahead waits a single Wild Hunt warrior, Nithral.
Note: You may wish to meditate and prepare potions and oils before jumping down on the platform with the enemy warrior. Swallow and Thunderbolt (+30 % attack) potions may come particularly handy. Once this battle is joined there is no escaping until Nithral is defeated.
Fight Nithral[]
Nithral
Nithral is a rather slow attacker, using a two handed weapon, so attack him quickly and as often as possible before ducking out of the way of his much more damaging swings.
He appears to be relatively resistant to staggering from attacks and he parries frequently, plus he is highly resistant to Axii, Aard, and Yrden. Quen is your best Sign option against him; turn it on, let rip through his first attack then roll away when he starts winding up a follow-up. An effective strategy is, when his first Freeze Bubble expires, quickly use Thunderbolt potion (+30 % attack), and then pummel him only with strong attacks, using Swallow potion when his (or your) health reaches one third. With bit of a luck he will go down before your health gets entirely depleted, and before he can deploy 2nd wave of hounds.
At around three-quarters and half Nithral will summon a rift that brings hounds to his aid and will attempt to heal inside of a magic bubble, do not attack him directly, instead kill his summoned minions as fast as you can. When all of his minions are gone he will stop healing and again be susceptible to damage. If attacked while healing, Geralt will be dealt a large amount of damage. Nithral heals about 3% every two seconds while in his magic bubble so be quick about defeating his summoned creatures. Attacks that pierce his armor are most effective.
Note: You will receive 250 for defeating Nithral as well as a Wild Hunt warrior's sword, Diagram: Angrenian cuirass, and some crafting components off his body.
Look for Information[]
After Nithral is defeated, Geralt will find yet another projection for Ciri, saying that the place isn't safe and that she should avoid the witches of Crookback Bog. Keira tells Geralt of the legend of the witches, and Geralt realizes if he is to find Ciri's path, he will need to find these powerful witches. Searching this area will find the following clues about the mysterious elven mage:
Herbs - Mysterious mage herbalist
Empty Potion Bottle - Potion that Keira gave him, must have drank it
Half burned notes - Must have burned these notes himself, must have known the Hunt was looking for him
After the White Frost - Book of interest to the Hunt
Geralt notices a wall blocking a doorway that makes his amulet vibrate and Keira remarks it's an illusion before giving Geralt an item called The Eye of Nehaleni, which can be used to dispel illusions.
Note: At the end of the chamber where you fight Nithral, opposite the side where the elven laboratory is set up, is a chest containing a random diagram, and to the left, a blocked up doorway which can be cleared with Aard. Inside is an illusion that can be dispersed with The Eye of Nehaleni. Beyond the illusion is a flooded area with loot and a chest with Maugrim guarded by a foglet appearing after you open it.
At the first junction past the illusion, Keira asks Geralt to continue in the opposite direction so she can find the Magic Lamp the elf promised her. Geralt can either choose to leave or go with her, ending the quest (350) and starting the new quest, Magic Lamp. Even if you said you're leaving though, you can still just follow her to start the quest.","Meet Keira at the entrance to the mage's hideout.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Ladies_of_the_Wood,Act_I,"Open Geralt's inventory and read the book The Ladies of the Wood which Keira gave to him at the end of the last quest. This book tells a fairy tale of witches, presumably the ""Ladies"", that will take in children and in exchange hear the pleas of those that supplicate at their shrine.
The Orphans[]
Travel to the marker however you see fit to find a shrine along the trail. Examine it for a short cutscene, then follow the path. You don't need to use Witcher Senses here as the marker will continuously update as you travel along it, eventually reaching some buildings. Approaching close enough will go into another cutscene, this time of children singing a strange rhyme. Talk to them to learn they're a group of orphans being taken care of by a woman named ""Gran"", who doesn't appear completely there mentally. No matter what you say, she'll refuse to talk to you and orders one of the children, Travik, inside while the rest will wander around but not say anything.
Talk to the Boy[]
You need to learn where Johnny is, but the one you need to talk to, Travik, is inside. Go in and try to talk with him, but Gran will keep telling you to go away while Travik suddenly appears to have a change of heart, saying Johnny isn't real. So now go talk to the other orphans to enlist their help. They'll ask you to play hide and seek with them, but you can then ask if there's something else they want, and they'll ask for treats. Note: Geralt appears to always have treats on hand, making this step very easy to do.

If you do play hide and seek, Geralt will count and they'll all hide. Simply use your Witcher Senses to follow their tracks:
Mikula: a trail of footprints leads into the northwestern hut where she's hidden just behind the door
Genny: a trail of footprints that go to the northeastern side of the chapel building, onto the roof, and in a haystack on the other side.
Aynara: her footprints lead through the eastern hut and out the back window to a spot behind some bushes close to the rear corner.
Yagna: her trail goes along the eastern side of the chapel building where she's hiding just around the corner of it, in the foliage.
Once you find the last child, or if you gave them treats instead, a cutscene shows the children distracting Gran, pulling her away from the hut, and Geralt going in and talking to Travik. You can choose to learn some about him before asking about Johnny if you wish. Once you ask about Johnny, he'll tell you the approximate location where his burrow can be found, just to the east.
Find and Help Johnny[]
Head out to the quest marker where you'll have to fight some drowners and a water hag before locating Johnny's trail nearby. Follow it north through the bog, where you will encounter more drowners before reaching the burrow. Interact with it to get Johnny to come out. (150) Talking with him won't yield much, as, you might have guessed, he can't talk. He'll then motion for you to follow him. Go with him through the swamp, where he'll unwisely get too close to yet more drowners. Watch out for the beehives nearby and once clear, follow the godling once more.

If you already got the bottle, Geralt will give it to him here when he realizes Johnny wants him to retrieve something from the nest on the cliff. Otherwise, you need to make your way up there, possibly dealing with some harpies, and retrieve the bottle.
Once Johnny has the bottle, he'll uncork it and his voice will return and he'll start jabbering away. You can ask him about the Crones and Gran if you wish, and he'll eventually point out that he saw Ciri running towards the orphanage and Gran might have seen something, but she won't talk to strangers. However, she will talk to Johnny who decides to help you, so follow him back to the orphanage where he'll once again try to run straight through some drowners and a water hag again. Kill them off and continue to the orphanage, where it'll go to a cutscene. Talk however you like to the ""Ladies"" and they'll eventually task you with seeing Downwarren's ealdorman before they'll tell you what they know of Ciri. Gran will then give you a special dagger that you must present to the ealdorman, so he knows the Crones sent you. (150)
Helping Downwarren[]
Follow the map marker to Downwarren and start a conversation with the ealdorman and show him the blade which signals you were sent by the Crones. The ealdorman will immediately offer the information needed to remove an evil surrounding a nearby tree. Note: If you already completed The Whispering Hillock, you'll automatically skip to letting the ealdorman know you dealt with the spirit.
Head south to the Ancient Oak, where a voice will ask you to leave. If necessary, kill the wolves in the area, then head to the western side to find a cave entrance guarded by a werewolf who must also be killed to get inside. Follow the partially flooded path until you reach the source of all the noise: a beating ""heart"" trapped in the roots of the tree, which will start the quest The Whispering Hillock.
Learn What Happened to Ciri[]
Once the other quest is complete, talk to the ealdorman again to let him know the task has been taken care of (if you already did it, you'll automatically go to this portion of the conversation). He'll ask what you did and you can choose whatever answers you wish, though naturally he'll react more to releasing the spirit than if you killed it. Geralt will then mention payment and the ealdorman will ask for the dagger and proceed to cut off his own left ear with it before giving it to Geralt. (250)

It'll then switch to a cutscene where Geralt is back at the orphanage, placing the ear on the rock. The Crones appear, though in a polymorphisized form, along with Gran, who they order to bring them the ear. Taking too long, one of the Crones makes a mark on Gran's hand burn and Geralt recognizes it and realizes it's the Bloody Baron's missing wife, Anna Strenger. Asking about her, the Crones reveal she made a deal with them to prevent her own unborn child from coming to term in exchange for a year of servitude. They then put her in charge of the orphans and fattening them up for the Crones, who would then eat them. Geralt will then go back to asking about Ciri, which will lead into the short quest, Fleeing the Bog.
After they finish the tale, you can react however you wish and the Crones will give a foreboding message before disappearing in a haze. The quest will then complete (200) and Family Matters will pick back up.","Find the Crones of Crookback Bog.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Whispering_Hillock,Act_I,"Regardless how you start this quest, make your way to the Ancient Oak where a voice will start telling Geralt to stay away. If you approached the tree from the east, nearby wolves will attack and have to be killed. Head to the western side, at the base of the tree to find a werewolf guarding the entrance to a cave and an Igni Place of Power. If you're having trouble finding this entrance, follow the white dotted path marked on on your map.
The werewolf can either be left alone or killed before heading into the cave entrance, although the werewolf will try to attack Geralt if he comes too close to it. Upon entering the cave, you'll follow a small, partially flooded path (with a couple of worthwhile chests underwater), finally reaching the beating heart in the roots of the tree.
Once the heart is reached, you can talk to the spirit, whose dialogue choices will depend on how you started the quest. If you were sent as part of the main quest, there will be some interesting choices to talk to the spirit about the Crones as well as the orphans at Crookback Bog. Otherwise, you'll just have some basic dialogue about why the tree was killing those who got too close. But ultimately, you must then decide the fate of the spirit: release them or kill them. Only directly saying that you don't trust the spirit is irreversible, as you can still decide to kill it later if you change your mind. Note: Your choice here will have a major impact on Downwarren's villagers, the orphans in Crookback Bog, and the Bloody Baron's family.
Release the Spirit[]
If you agree to release it, the spirit will tell Geralt to gather 3 things: a raven feather, the spirit's bones, and lastly, a wild, black horse.
You may already have the raven feather, particularly if you already met Johnny. But if you don't, head west of Downwarren along the path until you reach a small broken bridge and you'll see some harpies and birds circling near the cliff over a nest. Once you've killed off the harpies, loot the nest for the feather and a sealed bottle.
For the remains, head out into the swamps between the Ancient Oak and The Orphans of Crookback Bog signposts, where a water hag is nearby and possibly some drowners as well. Go to the southern edge of the yellow search area and, using Witcher Senses, find the spirit's grave and interact to get the remains, to which Geralt will remark they don't appear human.
For the final part, the black horse, head out to where the objective marker is to find several of them. They'll naturally run if you get too close, but you just need to get close enough to use Axii on one of them. If you're having trouble and all the horses run out of the marked area, new ones will appear. Once you successfully subdued one, mount the horse and ride back to the cave where the spirit is and through the new opening that appeared when you left earlier. Once close enough to the spirit, a cutscene will trigger.
Geralt will then have 3 different choices: release the spirit, trick it to let it die, or kill it.
If you go through with releasing it, Geralt will then begin the ritual and the spirit will then transfer to the horse, becoming Black Beauty. If you are doing this as part of the main quest and asked it to save the orphans, Geralt can then ask about them to which the spirit promises to keep their end of the deal and will then run off. Otherwise, the spirit will simply remark they're free again and run off, finishing the quest.
If you choose to trick it, Geralt will start the ritual but then refuse to stab the heart, letting the spirit die without a fight, finishing the quest.
If you changed your mind completely and wish to kill it, a fight will break out like if you had chosen to kill it before gathering all the required items.
Fight the Spirit[]
If Geralt outright refused to help free the spirit, either after the first conversation or after they gathered all the items to initially release it, the spirit will summon endrega workers to protect it. They appear in waves and, as soon as one wave is finished, concentrate on attacking the branches around the heart, which will eventually give way so you can attack the heart directly. Once the spirit is dead, the quest will complete and, if you were doing it as part of the main quest, Ladies of the Wood will resume.","Find where the voice is coming from using your Witcher Senses.

Drowners and hounds of the Wild Hunt will occupy the escape path, with the latter constantly appearing from portals all the way to the marker. However, it is not necessary to fight them. Simply running all the way to the marker on the other side of the bog will cause a cutscene to unfold in which Ciri successfully hides from Imlerith by climbing a tree and waiting out the danger. She then drops down and flees but eventually trips and falls down some rocks, before the quest abruptly ends. The quest Ciri's Story: The King of the Wolves picks up Ciri's story directly from the end of this quest.",Escape from Crookback Bog.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Pyres_of_Novigrad,Act_I,"Head to Hierarch Square where you'll be treated to a cutscene that introduces Caleb Menge, the commander of the Temple Guard and leader of the witch hunters, as he proceeds to burn Felicia Cori and the doppler Chappelle at the stake.
Afterwards, head south from the square and through the wooden doors into a courtyard to find a couple looters at what was once Triss' home. As no matter what you say will just lead to a small conversation, just ask to talk (telling them to leave will cause a fistfight but nothing is gained from it by doing so). They'll reveal that if Triss escaped, she likely went to Putrid Grove to get help from the King of Beggars, but neither knows where the grove is. You're then interrupted by Caleb, who has the looters arrested for trying to take confiscated Temple Guard property. Respond how ever you like here but Caleb makes it clear: witchers aren't welcome in his ""righteous"" city and he can't wait for Geralt to slip up so he can have the witcher arrested and executed like the mages.
Once he's gone, if you want to look around some first, head inside the home where you can examine some herbs and a hairbrush on the first floor, then head up to the second to examine some amulets on the counter. On the third and final floor, you'll find some of Triss' clothes that can be examined. Note on the bedside table you can also loot the Rose of Remembrance. Also, one of the chests outside can contain random diagrams. Once done, leave and head back into the square for a small cutscene.
Finding the Grove[]
There are several ways to find Putrid Grove, some more time consuming than others.
Find a thief in one of the 3 radius search areas and follow them
Find a beggar to ask for the location
Find the sewer entrance near Glory Gate
Thief[]
You'll need to look out for a pickpocket in one of the search areas, then keep a safe distance and follow him as he makes his way to The Butcher's Yard theater. A beggar will try to get money from you here, but any option will get him to leave. Continue following and as he nears the bridge, he'll pass the coin pouch off to another thief.
If you continue to follow the same guy, he'll lead you to a group of thugs and you'll have to have a fistfight with them, but they'll just surrender if you draw your sword, and eventually tell you the location and password to get through.
Following the new guy, he'll eventually lead you to the entrance. If you interact with the door but don't know the password, you'll eventually have 2 choices:
Pay 50  (earns 5  but will have to hand over your weapons before you can enter)
Use Axii (requires Delusion level 2, earns 35  and get to keep your weapons)
Regardless of which one is chosen, you'll earn 100  for entering the grove.
Beggar[]
Don't bother with any of the others except the one on the wooden scaffolding near Vimme Vivaldi, as even if the others are given money, they'll refuse to tell you where the grove is. The one on the scaffolding will want to converse but even if you push early about the grove, you can re-enter a conversation with him and he'll eventually reveal it and the password. Head to the entrance and use the correct one (""Old sow..."") and the guard will let you in, earning 100 .
Sewers[]
Head to the archway into the city from Glory Gate and jump into the water, then turn to face back towards the city. The entrance area will be the furthest right archway under the bridge, just under the gate itself. Follow this path until you find a couple drowners around a body. Once the threats are killed, loot the body for a key and use it to unlock the nearby grate and head in and climb up the ladder. The thieves aren't too thrilled about you finding the backdoor though and will attack. For this, you just need to weaken the lead thief near death and he'll call for mercy, letting you into the grove to continue as normal. However, you won't earn any  for using this way into the grove.
Note: Even though the looters mention it, in recent versions of the game this option doesn't seem to appear as an objective unless you go through with it and reach the thieves.
Help Triss[]
However you got into the grove, make your way to where the King of Beggars, Francis Bedlam, is to find none other than Triss discussing business with him. Francis will go into a bit of a political discussion, mentioning how he has grand plans for the city, before eventually letting you and Triss head off. Follow her and Geralt will eventually reveal he's looking for Ciri. Triss will agree to help, but first needs you to help her with an errand and takes you to Kluhg, a smuggler.
Unfortunately, Kluhg reveals he got scared by approaching guards and dropped Triss' package into the canal so you'll have to fish it out yourselves but, with Temple Guards just outside, you'll have to take the cellar. Head down and kill the lone drowner here, then use your Witcher Senses on the central pillar to find a brick to open the secret passage. Follow Triss along the canal and eventually you'll reach a spot you have to jump into to get the leather sack. Swim all the way to the last bridge before the harbor area and you should be able to spot the sack below, near the bridge's support column. Head back to Triss and follow her a short ways to her contract: a warehouse just off of the Fish Market.
It's soon revealed the man, Brandon, knows Triss is a sorceress, as with job competition so high, it was the only way to secure the job. When the price is asked about, you can choose to go ahead with the job without anything upfront, demand all of it upfront, or half of it. No matter what is chosen Brandon will relent, including giving the full amount beforehand.
Whatever you chose, follow Triss inside to set the incense at the 3 locations along the walls (easily found using your Witcher Senses). Once all 3 are placed, Triss will activate the incense. After the spell has been cast, approach and talk to her to have a conversation, answering however you like. Eventually after asking about Yennefer, the rats will flee and Brandon will appear, but with witch hunters in tow. The dialogue is slightly different depending on how much money you demanded in advance, but ultimately he'll leave the warehouse for the witch hunters to kill you and Triss. Kill them off, then confront Brandon outside.
Afterwards, Triss will point you to an oneiromancer, Corinne Tilly, who is working a job a few houses away along the canal and might be of some aid in finding Ciri. The quest will then conclude for 200  with Triss heading off to take care of other jobs.","Visit Triss in her house.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Novigrad_Dreaming,Act_I,"Head to the house where, before you can enter, the new owner, Rudolf de Jonkheer, will greet you. You can ask him more about the house but ultimately he'll let you go in seeing as you're a witcher and might help with whatever is haunting the house.
Upon entering you'll hear laughter and the sound of footsteps and, as you start to head upstairs, you'll hear Corinne in distress. Head up and you'll see a godling, Sarah, standing over the sleeping oneiromancer. After a short cutscene, it's clear Corinne is under a sleeping spell and won't wake up normally. However, she does gives you 2 clues: the doll and the attic. With that, head up to the attic (the door opposite the bed) and climb up the ladder. Use Aard on the blocked doorway, then enter to find the rag doll and the drawing of a crib here. If you already explored the house, Geralt will comment he knows where the cradle is, but regardless, just head back down to the room Corinne is in and, in the only other room off of the bedroom, you'll find the cradle.
After you place the doll here, the door will close, with a drawing on the back of it. After interacting with it, go find the oven, which is all the way down in the cellar (the trapdoor is on the first floor right next to the stairs). Note that while there's a weakened wall here, you don't need to go past it for this quest. Interacting with the oven will cause another cutscene, this time formally meeting Sarah, who'll reveal she was just having fun and sees the place as her home and was just trying to get the banker to leave. You can answer however you like in the first part, but in the second choice, you have to decide to either make a deal with her (allowing her to stay) or force her to leave.
Let Sarah Stay[]
If you wish to let the godling stay, agree to make a deal with her, and she'll let the dreamer wake up so you can talk to her. Doing this will eventually see Rudolf sell the house to some ""poor fool"" and will give access to the secondary quest, Haunted House.
Banish Sarah[]
If you wish to make the godling leave, you'll need burdock. If you haven't already bought it, head to the herbalist across the canal (you can talk to Rudolf as you head off to get it, but the conversation doesn't yield much). When ready, place the herb on the oven, stand back, then use Igni. Sarah will throw some insults at you but relents and leaves.
Talk to Corinne[]
Regardless how you dealt with Sarah, head back upstairs to Corinne. After talking with her, she'll agree to help you and asks that you meet her at her room at the Golden Sturgeon. With that, leave the house only for Rudolf to stop you to ask about the haunting, as Corinne didn't tell him what happened. No matter how you dealt with Sarah and if you tell the banker the truth or not, Rudolf will ultimately decide to sell the house and asks that you visit in a week or so as he'll give you a percentage of the commission when he sells the place.
Enter the Golden Sturgeon and head upstairs to talk with Corinne. She'll ask that you answer some questions truthfully to better help you. While there are a lot of options to give, you only need to answer one; the rest will just give background on the relationship between Geralt and Ciri. She'll then ask about Ciri's abilities, and you can again answer however you wish, before Corinne finally asks who you think Ciri would have gone to. Either choice will then go to a cutscene showing Dandelion, a swallow, and an explosion. Afterwards, Corinne will mention that the bard had inherited a brothel, The Rosemary and Thyme. The quest will then conclude for 100 .","Find the dreamer in the old house.

After the fight, talk with Zoltan where Geralt eventually reveals Ciri might still be in the area. Zoltan unfortunately has some bad news: he has no idea where Dandelion is, having disappeared while Zoltan was away. With that, you'll need to look around the first floor for clues. While the one you need is the planner near the door the vagrants came in, you can choose to look around and examine some other items and letters first if you wish.
Once you pick up the planner, Zoltan will note Dandelion had been meeting a lot of women lately and, with nothing better to go on, decides to split the list in half for each of them to track down. Once you read the planner, you'll earn 500 . Important: make sure to talk to Zoltan about the women, particularly Rosa var Attre. Otherwise, you might run into a bug later and have to find another workaround.
Note that it doesn't matter what order you talk to the women, just that after the first one you'll also earn 300  on top of the normal amount after talking to the individual.
Talk to Vespula[]
When you find Vespula, a washerwoman, you quickly learn she is being harassed by Whoreson Junior's thugs. You can choose a few things:

convince them Vespula is under the King of Beggars' protection (if you say under your protection, you'll have to fight them)
Once done, she's free to talk to, only she turns unpleasant when Dandelion is mentioned because after he made promises of them being together, she saw him at the harbor with some woman after a week of questioning her about the washer women at the bathhouse, so she threw him out. After you finish talking to her, you'll earn 150 .

Elihal, located in the Farcorners district just outside of Novigrad, is an elven tailor. They turn out to be a bit surprising, but unfortunately do not know where Dandelion is, commenting that they last saw the bard when he came in to have some tailoring done, but appeared more interested in asking Elihal about Kalkstein and how he desperately wanted to meet the alchemist. Unfortunately for Geralt, the alchemist was killed recently in one of the pyres. After you finish the conversation, you'll earn 150 .
Talk to Molly[]
This part can go slightly different in conversation depending if Aryan was killed or not. Head to the Gildorf district, where Maria Louisa La Valette has an estate and where Molly works.
If Aryan lived, Maria welcomes Geralt and the two, along with Morvran Voorhis, head to the Vegelbud Residence, where Molly currently is.
If Aryan was killed, Maria shows disdain towards her son's killer and heads back inside. Morvran will then inform Geralt that Molly no longer works there as, when Maria's nephew came to pay his respects for Aryan, he met Molly and they soon wed, making her Lady la Attard, and she now spends her days at the horse races near Vegelbud Residence.
At Vegelbud Residence you can race Morvran if you wish before Molly shows up where, if you win, you'll get the superior racing saddle. Once Molly appears, you can then question her about Dandelion, but she hasn't seen him in a while and the last time they met, he'd come by to borrow coin for a barge. She also notes that she's seen him with his sister, a blonde-haired woman. Once you're done talking, you'll earn 150 . You can then go and talk to Morvran if you wish to fast travel/ride back to Novigrad with him, or go on your own.
Talk to Marabella[]
In The Bits, near the la Valette estate, is a school where Marabella is teaching some children. You can choose to wait for class to finish or, if you say you can't wait, must then answer the students' questions. Afterward, she mentions how Dandelion spent their last visit pouring over a book about mold before he pointed one out, clearly not noticing her lack of interest. After the conversation ends, you'll earn 150 .
Rosa var Attre[]
In the Gildorf district is the var Attre estate. Say you're the new swordplay instructor and the guard will lead you in.
If you didn't ask Zoltan earlier about her, instead head around the left side of the estate (facing towards the front door) so you're going through the Passiflora's garden area. Keep following the estate walls to your right until you reach an angel statue with stone benches next to it, sometimes a vomiting nobleman is standing around here. That's where you drop through the break in the fence and follow the path (making sure to jump across the gap), then climb up the ledges. You'll know you're on the right spot to climb when you find a corpse with a love letter on him. Head around to the right of the building as you hear voices. However, on learning you're Geralt, ""Rosa"" will tell the guard you're her new training instructor and to show you in to the training room, where she'll be with you shortly.
Grab one of the wooden swords, then once downstairs Rosa will duel you to test your skills. After getting her health down to half or letting Rosa beat you up, you can then discuss Dandelion with her before she demands a rematch. This time you have to empty her health (or again, let Rosa beat you up), then another conversation starts up. If you want to do the quest Fencing Lessons later, agree to give her private lessons, then the conversation will turn back to Dandelion. Rosa's identical twin sister, Edna, joins the conversation and you'll learn that Dandelion took them on a weird rhetoric lesson in a graveyard where he questioned them about a Margrave Henckel. They then reveal that Dandelion spoke highly of a Koviri trobairitz whom he referred to as ""Callonetta."" Afterwards, if you have won both fights against Rosa, she will ask if you can give her a private lesson later. Ask for the time and place if you want to do Fencing Lessons, then leave, earning 150 .
Consult with Zoltan[]
After speaking to everyone on the list, head back to the Rosemary and Thyme to speak with Zoltan, who has acquired an owl and is trying to teach it how to talk. Having not learned much on his end, he asks what Geralt learned, who reveals Dandelion's odd behavior and the various descriptions of the woman. Zoltan is able to conclude that they're talking about Priscilla, a woman not on the list, and explains that Dandelion favors her more than any other woman. Better yet, she is currently in Novigrad and is performing at The Kingfisher Inn.
Head to the inn after sundown to watch a small performance by Priscilla as she sings a song that describes Yennefer and Geralt's relationship, captivating the entire audience. Afterward, Elsa, on seeing Geralt, will accuse him of being a murderer, but the rest of the patrons brush her off and Priscilla steps in. After introductions are made, she'll take Zoltan and Geralt to her room so they can talk in private. There, she reveals that Dandelion was planning a heist on one of Novigrad's big crime lords, Sigi Reuven, and the last thing she heard, Dandelion was being pursued by Whoreson Junior's men. Naturally, this means you'll need to talk to Whoreson Junior to find out more about Dandelion, but to do that, you must seek out Sigi Reuven to learn where Whoreson Junior is. The quest will then conclude here for 720 .","Go to the Rosemary and Thyme.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Get_Junior,Act_I,"Head to Sigismund's Bathhouse further north in the city and you'll be greeted by a voice telling you to leave. No matter how you answer, a short time later Happen will open the doors for you as Sigi Reuven has agreed to meet you.
You'll need to change first, so choose any of the wardrobes which will leave you in just a towel. With that, follow Happen through the bathhouse to the private room in the back and open the doors to greet none other than Dijkstra and the other 2 Big Four members: Francis Bedlam and Carlo Varese (Cleaver). Clearly they're not happy with Whoreson Junior. Before you can talk much, a number of Whoreson's henchmen attack, so kill them off before you can continue your talk.
After a bit of a long discussion, answering how ever you want, you'll be able to talk to Dijkstra in private where the past is brought up for a bit before you can talk about Junior. Dijkstra will eventually point you to 3 locations: a casino, arena, and Junior's house. The conversation will then turn to the current events if you wish to discuss that with him, but otherwise you can exit out of the discussion. Note that you'll need to eventually ask about Dandelion to start the other main quest, Count Reuven's Treasure. Regardless, once you have the information you need on Junior and exit out of the conversation, you'll earn 150 .
Visiting the three locations can be completed in any order, and if you want to do the secondary quest The Gangs of Novigrad, you can go and talk to Cleaver.
Important: if you attack or ask about Whoreson Junior at any time while visiting the arena and casino, you will not be able to use a secret passage later. The same applies if you get Cleaver's help, although a workaround is possible for that in the casino.
Junior's house[]
When you arrive at Junior's house, you will find that Cleaver's men have already raided it. You only have to examine 3 ""clues"" for Geralt to conclude that the place has been scrubbed clean and there's nothing to be learned here.
Arena[]
Head to the arena, where just south of the entrance you may run into Zdenek being killed by Junior's thugs. You can loot his corpse to find a certificate, and doing so unlocks the option to enter by impersonating him. However, don't do that if you wish to enter by other means as it will fail an objective.
At the entrance itself, there are two guards with whom you have the following options:
If you have the certificate, impersonate Zdenek
Pay them 100  (earning 10)
Use Axii (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35)
Threaten them (start a fight)
Note that even if you enter peacefully, the location culminates with a fight. A peaceful start allows you to do The Gangs of Novigrad here, however, using Axii and fighting in arena gives more XP and loot with more options later.
Option 1 (Use Cleaver's Help): Enter the arena peacefully and convince Igor you are looking for work as a bodyguard. Say you need time to prepare. Use this opportunity to go back outside and signal Cleaver's men to attack. Doing so will complete a required objective for The Gangs of Novigrad.
Option 2 (Fight in the Arena): Enter the arena peacefully and convince Igor you are looking for work as a bodyguard. He will want to test your skills in the arena and after you agree, it's time to fight for the crowd's entertainment. Your first opponent will be Gustav Roene, who will plead for mercy when beaten. If you spare him he will help you in the remaining fights, but you'll have to face an additional 3 dogs first. Your next opponents will be the ""Hairy Brothers"" (Skellige warriors), followed by a Wyvern, 2 Endregas (drone and warrior, though identically labeled) and finally a bear named Boris. Once the bear is defeated Whoreson will finally appear, but Cleaver's dwarves storm the arena before you can talk much and Junior orders you killed.
Regardless of how you played it until now, the rest is the same and you have to kill every last one of Whoreson's men, only your starting position differs. During this, you kill Igor as well, and you have to loot his body for a key, which opens a box next to his ""throne."" Reading the note you find inside, you now have to search for a stash using your Witcher Senses. You will find it on the bottom level, near the arena, where Geralt will notice dragging marks on the floor. Interact with the torch on the wall there (don't just ignite it) to open the hidden door with the stash inside. Loot the chest to find a mysterious letter and with that, your job at the arena is done.
Reading the letter reveals that Junior has been working for Radovid and directs you to Dijkstra. (150) Note: pursuing this lead to its end will fail the objectives for the other two locations, if not already completed.
Casino[]
When you get to the casino, you will have several choices to deal with the guards:
Propose to make a deal (this will lock out the bribing option when you speak to them again)
Threaten (this will initiate a fight)
Pay 200  (earns 20 )
Use Axii (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35)
Similarly to the Arena, the location will culminate with a fight even when starting with the peaceful route, but starting with the peaceful route can unlock a secret passage later and you can earn more XP and  from both Axii, fights, loot, and by playing Gwent in the meantime.
If you wish to go the peaceful route, make your way to the second floor and approach the gwent players. You have to beat 2 of them (two with a selectable bet up to 100  and one with a fixed bet of 50 ) before a cutscene triggers and the dealer invites you to a ""high stake room"" upstairs. If you refuse his invitation twice, he calls the guards and the fight starts then and there. If you accept, you'll find yourself in an interrogation room and regardless of what you say, the fight just starts there instead.
Note: Leave at least one enemy alive if you want to be able to also use Cleaver's help. Once you call the Cleaver's support, enemies inside will respawn and have to be killed all over again, but you get to complete The Gangs of Novigrad.
As with the arena, the rest plays out the same - you have to kill everybody and only your starting position changes. When all of Junior's men are dead, go to the interrogation room on the top floor, where a tied-up halfling is. Talk to him to learn that Whoreson is working for the Redanians and this directs you to Dijkstra. Note: pursuing this lead to its end will fail the objectives for the other two locations, if not already completed.
Free the halfling to complete your objective (150) and he'll promise you a reward from the King of Beggars, starting the secondary quest Honor Among Thieves.
Completing the objectives at the arena and the casino yields a bonus 150.
The Redanian contact[]
Regardless of how you learn of Whoreson Junior's connection to the Redanians, you will be redirected to speak to Dijkstra about it. He will in turn direct you to Vernon Roche, who apparently has contacts with the Redanians.
If you haven't met Roche yet, a small cutscene will play where Hortensio will stop you from entering the hideout. Regardless of your choice here, Roche will walk out and give his permission for Geralt to head inside. After a brief greeting, Ves will also make an appearance before your can talk about Whoreson Junior. Roche will say that he is on his way to meet his contact at Oxenfurt Chess Club, and will have to meet him there. (150)
Note: If you haven't yet explored Junior's house, casino or arena, this is your last chance to do so. Once you meet the Redanian contact, these objectives and the The Gangs of Novigrad quest will all fail if not already completed.
If you leave immediately you can ride along with Roche, but it's easier to just fast travel to Novigrad Gate. Once there, talk to Roche and head for the chess club. As you approach, a cutscene follows and the contact is nowhere to be found, but you meet Radovid instead. After some talk, he will reveal where and how to find Whoreson. Upon leaving, Vernon will ask Geralt for help regarding Ves which starts An Eye for an Eye. (150)
Find Whoreson Junior[]
When you go to Whoreson's hiding place, there are two guards in front and what happens when you talk to them depends on your choices so far.
If you haven't asked about Junior or provoked a fight yourself so far, say you're a new guy bringing girls and they'll tell you about the secret passage. With that, go to the marked location and then through a short underground tunnel, which leads you into the cellar of Whoreson's house.
In any other case, the guards will recognize and attack you. Kill them off and loot a key from one of them to unlock the front door and make your way to the big house right ahead.
Regardless of how you got in, everyone inside the estate is hostile and you have to slay multiple of Whoreson's men before reaching the second floor of his house. There you will find a gruesome scene and at last, Whoreson Junior inside the room. Geralt can't help but rough him up before ""kindly"" asking to what happened to Ciri, which starts Ciri's Story: Visiting Junior.
Once Ciri's story is finished, you can kill or spare Junior before the quest ends and you get 500 regardless of choice. What you do here only changes a little flashback later in the game, but note that you MUST kill him in order to complete all objectives, as you get the ""Kill Whoreson Junior."" just as you reach the second floor.
This will also update The Play's the Thing, or start it if you haven't already. While the quest is complete here though, you still have to leave the estate. Even if you did use the secret passage, the grate door back there is locked now, so you have to leave through the front door and still deal with enemies you've avoided before.
As you exit, several Redanian soldiers approach and take you to Radovid, who wants Geralt to return the favor. This sequence will start and complete A Favor for Radovid, and subsequently start Redania's Most Wanted too.","Go to the bathhouse and talk to Sigi Reuven.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Ciri%27s_Story:_Visiting_Junior,Act_I,"The mission starts during the final phase of Get Junior when Geralt finally does just as the title says and has him tell everything he knows about Ciri: Ciri and Dandelion have a conversation about busting out Dudu, apparently he is held in the room on the final floor which has a window with a balcony. Now, as soon as you are controlling Ciri, climb the ladder you see in front of you and keep climbing until you reach the roof. Move along the rooftops until you reach said balcony and jump down on it. Move toward the window and open it. Now you will see the cutscene of Whoreson Junior torturing Dudu and exchanging insults until Ciri interupts them. After that you will be fighting Whoreson Jr, Ciri now has a new skill ""Blink"" which allows her to attack multiple foes in the back, you can activate it in the same way Geralt uses alternate modes for his signs i.e. hold down the key which casts signs then release when ready. The new skill is useful, especially against foes with shields, but it has one flaw - Ciri returns to her original position once it's over so if her foe was about to hit her when activated she will be back in position for the strike, so it's best to activated it while all foes are at a distance. Defeat him and another cutscene will play where Ciri free's Dudu and Whoreson calls for backup. Now fight the backup and make your way downstairs while fighting off the thugs. Once you go though the exit door the mission will be over and you will be returned to the conversation between Whoreson and Geralt.","Get on the roof

Escape from Whoreson Junior's hideout"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Count_Reuven%27s_Treasure,Act_I,"After the fight in the bathhouse, meet with Sigismund Dijkstra and ask him about Dandelion. He will eventually ask Geralt for a favor before leading you into a hidden underground area with a friendly troll named Bart. Dijkstra explains that the empty area is his vault and, until recently, was filled with tons of gold and valuables. Now all that remains is a huge hole in the brick wall that his vault shared with the sewers behind it, obviously caused by some sort of explosion. He'll then point out he thought the vault was safe from the sewers as they are filled with a highly toxic gas from pops' mold before giving Geralt 3 bottles of the antidote so he can investigate the sewers safely. One bottle alone lasts a long time so the 3 he gives should be plenty, but the formula is also given just in case.
Explore the sewers[]
Dijkstra will then leave and you can begin investigating the mess Dandelion got himself into. If you want, you can talk to Bart, but he doesn't have much to say other than he heard what sounded like hissing rocks. Take the antidote and use your Witcher Senses to view notable items. As you make your way in the sewers, several drowners will appear and attack. Eventually you'll discover 2 bodies and if you examine them, Geralt will note they need to be burned to get rid of the drowners.
Do so, and the drowners ahead will despawn (you may have to backtrack a bit to despawn all if you wish), otherwise you'll have to kill a few more in the next room. Carry on your investigation and once you've noted everything and found a fragment of a silver cylinder, the objectives will update, but if you continue through the other gate just a bit further to the end, Geralt will comment on this, noting Dandelion must have had a boat ready to take the gold at the end on the tunnel. You should also have found two rings by now that can be sold for a nice profit, but either way head back to Dijkstra.
Geralt will inform Dijkstra of all the evidence he found and his deduction: the robbers blew the hole in the wall by dropping the bomb through one of the drain pipes in one of the pools. (200) Dijkstra will then go with you to investigate the pools. The nearest one for Geralt is intact so move to the second. Examine the water to note there's oil on the surface, then move to the back of the pool to find a silver lid similar to the bomb. Dijkstra will then have Happen check the logs on who used the pool on the day of the break-in and a name stands out: Margrave Henckel. Turns out Henckel died a few months back so whoever used their name obviously had some hand in the robbery. The former spy will then task you to head to Henckel's house to check for any clues. After the conversation, you'll receive 50 .
Henckel's house[]
At Henckel's house there are a few clues to examine, but just follow the footsteps upstairs to find the mysterious note and wine bottle on a table there. Take the bottle and interact with the wine rack in the other room to unlock the hidden area. Head inside and read the letter on the chest near the bed, which mentions that Ciri took part in the heist, a doppler named Dudu helped her, and Dandelion was caught by Caleb Menge. After picking up the note you'll receive 50  as Geralt hears footsteps downstairs. There's a few other notable items in the room you can examine, like the bomb on the table and the notes on how to make it. Once done, head downstairs to find Dijkstra along with Triss.
The conversation that follows has a few romantic options if you wish to flirt with Triss, but otherwise it boils down to Dijkstra forcing Geralt and the sorceress to come up with something to get information about his gold from Menge. Triss will then ask you to meet her at the Eternal Fire shrine at midnight.
The Witch hunter's outpost[]
At midnight, go to the shrine and Triss explains that the witch hunter's outpost is a fortress and thus impossible to sneak in or use brute force before showing you her plan: a pair of fake dimeritium shackles. You are to bring her, a highly sought after sorceress, to the witch hunters, which should grant Geralt an audience with Menge but, to really make it work, Geralt will also need to persuade them that he has information on Philippa Eilhart.
What happens next depends on the actions the player takes. There are multiple branches in conversation, and many can lead to a fight.
Important: if you do not ask about the treasure, Dijkstra will not be pleased and will refuse to give anything during Brothers In Arms (as he only gives 1,000  if helped though, this isn't that big of a deal).
If the player insults the guards or says anything threatening to try and protect Triss the guards will attack, losing the chance to talk to Menge about Dandelion or the treasure. You will then have to look for a note that mentions a spy and use that to find out about Dandelion but you won't know the location of the treasure.
This is one of those moments where using Axii will NOT work due to it being a group and the witch hunters will attack instead.
The quick path if one wants to talk to Menge:
In the first conversation: ""Wanna talk..."" > ""Got something to offer..."" > ""I'll tell your boss...""
Second conversation: ""Take her""
Third conversation: ""Why not"" > ""Haven't been paid"" or ""silver sword"" or ""no other way?"" > ""Do anything for gold"" or ""Triss betrayed me"" > ""Dandelion""
Do NOT mention the treasure unless you want to help Dijkstra as it will cause Menge to attack when you next ask about Dandelion. However, if you do mention it, you can find out about Dandelion another way.
If the player sat through the conversation and the torturing next door peacefully, Menge will take you to the torture room to see why it went quiet, only for Triss to attack and kill him and she will apologize for acting prematurely. Regardless of what you say, Triss searches his body and finds a key for Dijkstra's treasure, as well as one that unlocks the nearby door. After the conversation, you receive 300 and have the option to quietly sneak out.
If Menge attacks you though, you'll have to kill the witch hunters as if you outright attacked from the start. In this case though, you can get away with only the ones upstairs as not all may get attracted. After the threats are dealt with, Triss will scold Geralt before telling him to search Menge's desk. (200) Inside you'll find a spy's letter and Menge's Holy Tome. Read the letter to trigger another talk with Triss, during which she finds the same keys as in the other scenario and you can leave.
Regardless of what happened, head through the locked door in Menge's office and downstairs to the courtyard. Triss will set the place on fire and teleport out, while you have to climb onto the middle structure's roof and over to the other side. Use Aard on the north wall and as you exit, you are approached by one of Dijkstra's men who will lead you to him.
Dijkstra and the spy[]
What happens now depends on your choices so far. Dijkstra will naturally be pleased or not depending on if you asked Menge about his treasure. But more importantly, if you had to search the desk and found the spy's letter, he'll give you directions on how to follow that lead. Regardless of choices, he also reveals that he found out Geralt knew who stole his treasure, but still pays you 90  and 100 is earned at the end of the conversaion.
If the player didn't learn where Dandelion is from Menge:
Head to the location of the dropbox. The spot is on one of the pillars on the side facing the house wall. Now head to the location in Farcorners and wait for midnight. If you show up early and get the option to hide, go behind the door and meditate until midnight. Triss then appears, having learned from Dijkstra of the meeting place. Shortly after, the spy appears and Triss grips him in a spell. You can either ask her to stop or let her continue. If you don't stop her, he will reveal who he works for. Ask about Dandelion and he'll reveal his location and how one can free him. After you finish questioning him, a timed reaction appears where you can decide to kill the man or wipe his memory. You can then ask how Triss is feeling before she mentions needing help with something and leaves. After the conversation, you'll receive 50 .
Afterwards, you'll be directed to go talk to Priscilla. Head there to complete the quest.","Question Reuven about Dandelion's disappearance without raising any suspicions.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Play%27s_the_Thing,Act_I,"Go to the Kingfisher Inn and talk to Priscilla. Note: if Now or Never is in progress, the front door will be locked, but you can still get in through the back.
After different dialogues depending on how much you've talked with her already, the two of you come up with the idea to stage an entirely new play in order to lure Dudu out of hiding. Priscilla is ecstatic and starts writing the script right away, while Geralt's creative input only goes as far as the name and genre. Choose whichever name you like, but the genre predetermines outcomes later.
If you pick drama, a riot will break out after the play and you'll have to kill people, while comedy will keep the crowd happy and will earn you extra 30 . After the decisions are made, Priscilla instructs Geralt to take the script to Irina Renarde at the nearby theatre and the conversation ends. (300)
The door to the theatre is locked though and an annoying ticket seller leaves you no choice but to buy a ticket for 50  (5), even though there's no play to attend.

The two strongmen will agree to usher regardless, but if you pick the challenge and win, you get your coin back.
Recruit the Puffins[]
Head to the Puffins' place at The Bits where you'll get treated to a cutscene as you enter. After clearing up a misunderstanding, they inform Geralt that they can't currently work because Fatso's gang has been troubling them. If you solve the problem for them, they'll be happy to publicize the play.
To find Fatso, follow the marker just a tiny distance nearby and you'll see three bandits bothering someone. Talk to them and after they trash talk Geralt, you'll have 3 options aside from backing out:
Fight them
Pay 50  (5)
Use Axii (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35)
No matter what you choose though, the issue won't be resolved unless you fight them, as they'll swindle Geralt if paid and Axii doesn't work on the whole group. Note: to earn more  you can pay them first, then back out and talk to them a second time using Axii to start the fight.
Once the fight starts, you only have to knock one out (it's a sword fight, but they don't die) before the other two are scared off. The Puffins then appear, praising Geralt and happy to do the job for free. At this point, 150 is earned and there are further 25 and 30  awarded when the quest completes.
Note: You can also deal with Fatso's gang before meeting the Puffins and they'll agree to help then too.
The Cast[]
Go back and talk to Irina Renarde, with whom you will now choose the cast members. Geralt will play the witcher regardless of what you say, but the choices you make for the princess and doppler can affect the play itself and the rewards at the end of the quest:
Princess
Priscilla (25 / 20 )
Irina Renarde (25 / 10 )
Doppler
Abelard Rizza (110 / 30 )
Maxim Boliere (no rewards; will be drunk for the performance)
Once you've made your choices, you can start the play immediately or delay so you can learn your lines.
The Play[]
The Doppler's Salvation script
Talk to Irina again to start the play and you'll now be on stage with timed dialogue choices for your lines in between multiple cutscenes. The more lines you get right, the bigger the reward you get later; here are the correct picks:
To slay beasts most foul...
Perhaps 'midst the guests...
Seems men's hearts...
But a base heart...
No monster is he...
Note: Getting all the lines correct awards a hidden bonus - 10% discount on prices from all merchants in Novigrad.
During the play, Geralt recognizes Dudu in the crowd and pulls him on stage without blowing his cover, so even if you performed misarably for the play, the mission is a success.
However, if you chose to write a drama script, there's one more obstacle before you can talk to Dudu, as one of Fatso's thugs screams ""Dopplers to the stake!"" at the end and starts a riot. You then have to help Zoltan and the ushers in defeating the bandits and other outraged patrons. Unlike the fight to recruit the Puffins, the deaths here are very real. If you chose comedy instead, the thug's mate will calm him down instead.
Regardless of how it played out, you get 500 here and go backstage to finally reunite with Dudu. During the dialogue, you have the option to make the doppler transform into Ciri for a moment, then Geralt reveals the plan to rescue Dandelion and with some convincing from Zoltan, Dudu reluctantly agrees to impresonate the late Caleb Menge. If you helped Dijkstra recover his treasure, you can then directly agree to meet at the ambush spot or say that you'll ask him for support, but you'll have that option later anyway.
Afterwards, Irina Renarde will have varying commentary depending on your acting performance and other choices during the quest, then pay you accordingly as well. In addition to all previously mentioned choice rewards, you get 50 (technically for having ushers) and:
All correct lines: 150 / 50 
3+ correct lines: 125 / 20 
At least 1 correct line: 110
If you did everything right (comedy, recruit the Puffins, cast Priscilla and Abelard, all correct lines), the sum of all extra rewards here will be 360 / 160 , whereas the least possible is 75 / 10 . The quest then completes, starting A Poet Under Pressure.","Tell Priscilla what you've learned about Dudu.
If exited conversation:
Write the play's script with Priscilla. (300)

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Poet_Under_Pressure,Act_I,"If you helped Dijkstra with his treasure hunt during Count Reuven's Treasure, you can meet him back in his bathhouse office, and he agrees to send a small band of his men to help you with the ambush. He'll give you 3 initially, but push for more and he'll agree to 4 if you keep your mission secret or 6 if you reveal it.
For the ambush itself, go east of the Seven Cats Inn and, as you approach the objective, head up the grassy embankment to the north of the road, as the target location is up on a hill where Zoltan Chivay is waiting. He and some of his fellows have set the ambush for the convoy transporting Dandelion from his prison on Temple Isle to Oxenfurt.
Talk a bit with Zoltan before Priscilla arrives bringing news from Dudu that the convoy leaves at dawn. She stays whether you ask her to leave or not and will challenges you to a game of Gwent while you wait. There's nothing to win from the game, so it's truly only a time killer until you hear the sounds of horses approaching.
You don't have to fight during the ambush and Zoltan even tells Geralt to follow Dandelion instead, but stay for the action and loot if you wish. Follow the running horse's tracks using your witcher senses, preferably on Roach. Eventually you'll pass by a lake where a few drowners will appear. They aren't part of the quest and if you're doing it at the recommended level a couple of drowned dead may be way above you anyway.
Spot where Dandelion's ring is
If you wish to find and return Dandelion's ring later, get off Roach just after the drowners and use your witcher senses to follow along the lakeside to find hidden amongst the red horseshoe prints the Pegasus signet that Dandelion dropped. The ring lays on a rock just by the water, but can be hard to find at first and has the same red coloring as the horseshoe prints.
Keep pursuing the horse, and lying on the road north of Honeyfill Meadworks, you'll see three red pages with some poetry notes that Dandelion dropped on the way. Follow the horseshoe prints to the camp where it is unclear which direction Dandelion took as there are horseprints that lead both left and right at a fork in the road. You can ask for help from the blacksmith in the camp but he may only confuse you by saying the horse ""turned left there"", as he means left further in the woods and not the left fork just next to him. If you do go immediately left, the tracks lead to horses just outside Yantra and Geralt will declare that he has taken the wrong path. Instead, take the right fork in the road following the horseshoe prints where you will find Dandelion's hat lying on the road. Examine the hat to get scent of Dandelion's perfume and follow the scent trail. As you follow that, eventually the horseshoe prints disappear and the search marker stops updating, with only the scent trail remaining.
Follow the scent trail to the Isolated Hut in the woods where you'll see a collapsed horse. Talk to the distressed halflings about the intruder into their home. They will give you the key to a secret tunnel behind the house. Go down the ladder and at the opposite end of the room you will find another ladder leading into the house. Climb it up and behind a door you will find the Witch Hunter and Dandelion tied to an chair. Kill the Witch Hunter and free Dandelion to start a series of conversations, during which he tells Geralt about Ciri and you play as her again during Ciri's Story: Breakneck Speed. Completing the flashback quest will also update In Ciri's Footsteps as this is the end of her story in Novigrad.
While the quest is already complete here, when the scene returns to present time, there's a lot more talking and you get 1000 after you're done with all of it. If you then talk to the halflings again, they will give you a Painting of Hierarch Hemmelfart, which can later be given to Dandelion for his Cabaret.","If helped Dijkstra find his treasure:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Ciri%27s_Story:_Breakneck_Speed,Act_I,"Upon stepping outside from Whoreson Junior's hideout, Ciri must find a way to flee towards Temple Isle. You do not have to fight anyone right away if you don't want to. Run out of the alley and turn right towards the large gate with Dandelion on the other side. The gate will raise and beyond the gate are two horses, one of which Dandelion jumps onto while Ciri can use the other. After fleeing some distance, it becomes necessary to dismount in order to enter a door that leads to the Great Temple of the Eternal Fire.
There are a lot of Junior's henchmen in front of the door though, and these have to be killed. This can be a tough fight if you don't have much practice playing as Ciri. Be mindful that you're near a cliff edge and can fall to death by mistake if you teleport a lot. After the enemies are dealt with, simply walk through the door for another cutscene to trigger.
In front of the temple, Ciri and Dandelion knock over Nathaniel Pastodi, who calls the guards. Ciri manages to deftly defeat a number of Whoreson's henchmen, before a Temple Guard aims a crossbow at her. As the bolt is loosed at Ciri, Dandelion rushes to save her, before she uses the Elder Blood to teleport away.","Flee towards Temple Isle.
Mount another horse."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Destination:_Skellige,Act_I,"Go to the harbor, you will have 3 ships marked on your map. One will be run a by a female captain, she will refuse to take you to Skellige. Another one will have no captain on-board and the marker will disappear once you board it and try to talk to the crew. On the last one you will find Captain Liglad looking out at the sea with a spyglass, He will also refuse to take you but will direct you to The Golden Sturgeon to find Wolverstone the Captain of Atropos.
You will find the Captain in front of the innkeeper, obviously hammered. Talk to him and he will agree to take you to Skellige for a paltry 1000. Pay him (earning 100 ) and he will ask if you are ready to go. When you tell him you are ready, the Captain will take ""One for the road"" then you'll set sail with him. (500)
A cutscene will play where Geralt goes to sleep in his cabin, and soon gets a rough awakening from Skellige pirates. Fight the Pirates along with the crew. Once most of them are dead, another cutscene will play where the ship crashes and Geralt gets hit with a falling mast.
A few hours later, Geralt will wash up on Ard Skellig along with the rest of the crew and get a less rough awakening from Steingrim who will attempt to rob his ""corpse"". After a conversation on his current location, Geralt will ask Steingrim about Yennefer, who will express his dislike towards the sorceress. You have the option to fight him in a brawl for it but won't get anything if you win, or just tell him that Yennefer gains a lot once you get to know her. Regardless, he will tell you the way to Kaer Trolde and part with you there.
Before you start exploring Skellige, head south of where you landed. You will find the remains of the Atropos and Wolverstone's body behind her wreck. Thankfully he has not drank away any of the money you gave him, so feel free to take it back from his body. Also, make sure to loot the containers around the wreckage for loot and some random diagrams.
Once you reach Kaer Trolde Harbor go to the crowd that is performing the funeral of their King. You will now be conversing with Yennefer and have a chance to flirt with her. Eventually, you will have 3 options on your opinion on going to the ""wake"", although you will have to attend it regardless of your choice here. Afterward, you will have a conversation about Ciri where you can tell Yennefer what you know so far or just ask her what she has found out on Skellige. Finally, you will have a short conversation with Crach an Craite, who will demand you attend the wake and the quest is over. (250)","Find a boat headed to Skellige.

Now go meet Yennefer who is speaking with Birna; after a short conversation Birna leaves and Yennefer will now praise Geralt's appearance or berate him if he is not wearing proper clothes.
Note: unfortunately Yennefer may berate Geralt even if he is wearing the clothes you find in the chest, this happens if they are removed and then put back on, or if he is wearing gloves. However, if Geralt is wearing other clothes, you can wear the formal courtier's clothes, which he gets during the Imperial Audience, and then he will always be praised even if the optional objective is not completed.
Walk with Yennefer to Kaer Trolde, if you decide to do some ""exploring"" along the way Yennefer will berate Geralt, then say she'll be waiting at the entrance (note that this fails an objective). Once you reach the party, you will be sharing a table with Cerys an Craite and other Jarl's sons. She will propose a foot race, you can agree or refuse, if you agree you will race her to the top of the mountain, first to pull out Hjalmar's axe out of the tree stump wins (150).
Now back at the wake you can have a toast or not, regardless Yennefer will pull Geralt away from the table to speak in private, along the way they will meet two quarreling Jarls. After a short conversation, Madman Lugos will insult Yennefer and Geralt can beat him up for it. Warning: Lugos is level 30, so be sure you know what you are doing before you decide to challenge him as this can be a tough fight but still doable (150 ).
You may speak with other named guests, gaining character entries and information about Skellige and its people. The guests will invite you to toast to King Bran; if you do Yennefer will warn you she needs you sober but there is no effect other than dialogue changes. After the initial interactions you may speak with some of these guests again for further information. Geralt and Yennefer also overhear a pair of widows speaking. After interacting with them Yennefer mentions Lytta Neyd (Coral).
After the whole ordeal, keep following Yennefer and she will tell you her plan - break into Ermion's laboratory to steal the Mask of Uroboros, agree or not it's irrelevant as Yennefer never listens to Geralt. Keep going and eventually you will reach a door, Yennefer will propose going through a window as the door is guarded by Ermion's ravens.
Through the window, you will reach a trophy room with life-like stuffed animals and use your witcher senses to search the place. When you interact with the door Geralt will cut himself causing him to hallucinate, and the animals will come to life and attack so you have to kill all them all. When they're all killed, Yennefer will bring Geralt back to his senses and laugh at him. Note: while the animals are level 99 and have a skull item, they deal very low damage and die quickly. However, if they ""kill"" Geralt, the death will be very much real and result in a game over, so there is no way to avoid this, like by choosing not to fight.
The door to the laboratory is now open, enter and search it with your witcher senses where you will find a statue holding it's hand out. There are 3 items you can find in the room which you can try to put into the hand: a skull, giant pinecone, and cup of mead. The cup is the correct one, however there is no punishment for picking the wrong item, so you can try all 3 if you like. Once you pick the right item, a secret door will open, so your path forward is set. The mask is at the end of the path, but it's guarded by an earth elemental, which must be defeated. Note: Yennefer is capable of taking care of it on her own with her lightning strikes, so you can just stand idle and watch, but this will take significantly longer.
After the elemental is dead, poisonous gas will fill the room and your only means of escape is teleporting out of there. Yennefer will ask you to think about something real quick. If you choose the first option, Geralt and Yennefer make a crash landing back at the wake, however no one seems to mind. If you choose the second option they end up in Yennefer's room where she has ripped her dress and goes to repair it before returning to the wake. If you choose the ""watch"" option, Geralt and Yennefer have sex on the stuffed unicorn in her room.
After the celebration, you will be talking to Crach an Craite, who will agree to help you with Ermion and ask for help concerning his children. After agreeing to help the quest concludes (600 ) and you also get the Possession and The Lord of Undvik quests.
While the quest has ended at this point, the feast is still going on until you leave the area. If not spoken to previously, you talk to all the jarls around (Crach, Lugos, Donar and Holger Blackhand) while still there, you get an extra 100 .","Go to Yennefer's rooms and put on formal attire.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Echoes_of_the_Past,Act_I,"Once you reach your destination you will see Yennefer and Ermion arguing. Ermion will call Yennefer a thief and explain that the Mask of Uroboros will lose it's power once it's used and may bring calamity on everyone. After inquiring the matter further and reasoning with Ermion it turns out Yennefer went ahead and used the mask, which causes a magic storm to appear in the area. Ermion rallies his fellow druids to try to calm it down, while Geralt goes ahead to find Yennefer.
Once you reach Yen she will be fighting a Foglet, kill it and Geralt will start talking with her. The mask only works in specific locations where magic is exceptionally strong, now she will pass it to Geralt and tell him to use it while she will use a spell to see through his eyes. The mask works pretty much just like the Magic lamp so if you did the A Towerful of Mice quest you pretty much have an idea what to expect. Now follow Yen to the first location, once there you will see some lime green sparks floating around, you should have the Mask already equipped, so just stand in those sparks and activate it. You will see 2 people coming out of a portal and Geralt will recognize the female person to be Ciri as ""she moves like a witcher."" Now move to the next location and do the same. Kill the Foglet that appears then use the Mask again. Repeat the process 2 more times and then Geralt will start conversing with Yen, soon Ermion joins too. It is decided that you have to find the body of one of the people you saw in one of the visions. This time Ermion joins the search so get going to the location and find the right corpse, once you find the body it turns out it belongs to one of the riders of the Wild Hunt. Ermion will inform you that a few weeks later after the explosion the Wild Hunt has also been seen on Hindarsfjall - your next destination.

If you already haven't, you may want to buy The Lonesome World Guide to Hindarsfjall to save a boat trip. Once there, go to Lofoten with Yennefer.
The Wild Hunt clearly weren't there for a social visit as you will find a mass of graves. Just past the entrance to the village there's a fisherman who can be talked to, but he turns out to be quite useless. Eventually you will find priestesses performing a ritual honoring the fallen, Geralt suggests waiting, however Yennefer is not kind enough to wait and interrupts them. Like it or not you will inquire on what happened. Eventually the conversation will move on to Skjall and how he went to fight Morkvarg to regain his honor. If the quest In Wolf's Clothing was started but not completed, it will be updated now with info about the monster. If it was completed, Geralt will just mention the results of their meeting. Regardless it's time to go to Freya's Garden. Once you reach the garden the quest ends.","If you didn't teleport:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Nameless,Act_I,"Enter Freya's garden through the steps on whichever side and once you reach the tree in the middle, some dialogue follows and it is decided that Geralt should handle the tracking on his own.
Using witcher senses you will find blood trails and footsteps. Following the footsteps to the right leads to the bottom level, where you have to fight off multiple wolves and in a roundabout way ends at a locked door, very close to where you started. You will also find other clues here, which are part of In Wolf's Clothing. If you've already completed that quest, the door will be unlocked, so push ahead through and you'll see a well that you have to jump into. However, if you haven't dealt with Morkvarg yet, in order to avoid complicating matters it's best to just follow the blood trail instead.
Following the blood to the left, you'll have to deal with a lone wolf near a dead body. If you inspect the corpse, Geralt will remark it's not Craven and will yell out his findings to Yennefer. She'll say you need to return to her, because she can't hear you, but upon doing that you just get berated for wasting her time, so don't bother. Push ahead and cross the small wooden bridge, after which climb the ladder and you will find two levers there.
The one on your right selects the gate you wish to open while the other opens or closes it. Between the two levers, a wooden stick indicates which of the three gates is selected. The one you need to open is the one in front of you when facing the levers. Use the right lever to open the gate matched to the middle stick. The quest will update when you open the correct one. Note: The lever that selects the door you wish to open works only when all gates are closed, so don't expect to open all three at the same time.
Once the gate is open, jump in the water, go through the opened gate, climb the ledge and then find a ladder that will take you to the remaining part of the garden. Head left and you will reach the other side of the locked door, with Skjall's footsteps and blood leading from it into a well. Jump down, and Geralt will get to spook Yennefer once he starts yelling. After a short conversation, push forward and you will find the Craven/Skjall's body. Note: Examining the body will trigger a cutscene with Yennefer at the top, back outside the well, so it's best to explore a little ahead in the cave, pick up the key from the skeleton and open the exit in front of it. Else you will have to run all the way back again if you wish to visit it again.
Now examine the body and Geralt will tell Yen that Craven/Skjall is dead, she will be unhappy but tell him to bring his corpse to her. Once Geralt does that Yen will explain her plan - she will use the garden's energy to revive the poor fellow using necromancy. Once she does and forces him to talk, the quest ends (200) and you're put into Ciri's shoes for The Calm Before the Storm.
After the scene returns to Yennefer and Geralt, the garden has died during the whole process and the priestesses show up furious about this. Yennefer will admit she is to blame for it all, keeping Geralt somewhat still in favor with them.

If Ciri asks how long was she out, the conversation can take a turn where Ciri asks Skjall if he stripped her, which he admits doing but declines being the one to rub blubber on her breasts stating that it was his mother and sister who did that. After asking for help with standing up Astrid will join in and ask Ciri to join her in the sauna. Ciri will prefer to leave as soon as possible, however Skjall will tell her she will need a horse to reach Drowned Dead Rock so he will get one ready while she accepts the offer.
Follow Astrid and after reaching the sauna she will ask Ciri to strip, so enter the room and interact with the mirror inside to do just that. If you are worried about nudity, note that Ciri will still have her chest in bandages and she will be wearing her underwear. You can choose to wear a towel, however that will only result in Ciri explaining why she is such a shy Nordling girl. If however she goes ""naked"" she will be asked about her tattoo. Regardless what you prefer now choose the option to go to the sauna. After more chit-chat you will have the option to go take a short dip if you want to. Doing so will regenerate Ciri's health bar, and you can also drink a shot of Freya's Firewater which will do the same; if both are done her health bar will become full.

Unfortunately, Donar doesn't have much else to tell you other than the fact that he sold the creature to a merchant, who wanted to sell him off as a court jester, and thus headed off to Novigrad.

After taking Uma from him (125), Geralt heads for Kaer Morhen, but will be stopped on the road by Nilfgaardian Soldiers and taken to Vizima to see the Emperor. Once there, Yennefer will appear too. Emhyr will be displeased with Geralt at first, but then awards Geralt half of the promised money (4000) when all details around Uma are revealed.
After the audience, Geralt will give the Phylactery to Yennefer and continue with Uma to Kaer Morhen. Once there, he will be greeted by Vesemir, who will update him on what's been going on while he was gone. After the conversation, you are free to explore the Kaer Morhen region and the first three subquests will start.
Kaer Morhen[]
One of your tasks is to find Lambert in the keep and you'll likely see him first, but go see Yennefer in the northern wing before that, as she will better set up the scene and will initiate the first step for Disturbance.
Note: If you decided to romance Triss, you can ask Yen about the bed and annoy her. If you push it too far, she will teleport Geralt away up in the sky and have him fall into the lake to the north. After returning you can annoy her again by saying you had a ""nice view"" from there, to which she will reply she should have teleported him a few miles higher, but Geralt tells her it's enough arguing.
Refer to the separate pages for Disturbance, To Bait a Forktail... and The Final Trial before the story can progress further. Each of them completes a task that Yennefer needs before she can attempt to lift Uma's curse.
Important: While in the progress of all this, note that there are two items to be found within Kaer Morhen's walls, which have limited time to be used:
Triss' earring can be found on the broken bed Vesemir mentions. The earring itself is hard to spot, but you'll manage once you find the bed, in the northeastern part of the fortress. While you can find it at any time, it should be done so early enough that you don't miss the chance to give it back to Triss, after Blindingly Obvious and before the main story completes.
Berengar's notes can be found in the ruins of a cell-like room, near the western wall and inside the middle courtyard. Reading them will start the secondary quest Berengar's Blade, for which you need to talk to Vesemir before setting off for The Isle of Mists.
When you're done with the first three subquests, it's time for everyone to gather together and Vesemir will decide to take Uma for 1 day to try to remove the curse himself. While they are away, you get to have fun during the No Place Like Home quest. Yen will eventually leave you with the boys for it, but not before revealing that in order to lift the curse, she will have to perform the Trial of the Grasses on Uma.
When Vesemir returns in the morning, he'll share he learned a little bit, but ultimately couldn't lift the curse himself, so you're moving with Yennefer's plan in the final subquest Va Fail, Elaine. The ritual ultimately succeeds and the curse is lifted, revealing that Uma is Avallac'h who will tell you how to find Ciri.
The quest then finally completes (1,500) and The Isle of Mists starts, with its own sub-quests:
Brothers In Arms: Nilfgaard
Brothers In Arms: Novigrad
Brothers In Arms: Skellige
Brothers In Arms: Velen (may auto-complete if finished Keira Metz' questline)

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Disturbance,Act_II,"Begin by heading up to the guest room. Just as you reach the floor, you will see and hear a magical explosion, followed by Yennefer cursing. Approach and you will enter a cutscene, where she will explain that ""this was the third crystal"" and that she has an urgent call to make. She tells you she suspects there is a disturbance causing the megascope crystals to malfunction, and entrusts you to find it. As the conversation ends, she will give Geralt a potestaquisitor - an equippable quest item, which will hum when near a magical disturbance.
Note: if Geralt rejected Yennefer during the secondary quest The Last Wish and you choose to argue with Yennefer about the bed, she will teleport Geralt to the lake north of the fortress.
Then go to the main hall and use it, following the sound as it gets louder and stronger. The disturbance is near Uma so you may think he is the problem but he is not, nor is it in the cage or wall (there's an interaction showing there, but that's just to look at the mural on the wall). It is the crates right next to the cage, that contain dimeritium bombs made by Lambert. Once you interact with them, Vesemir will take them away while Geralt keeps on eye on Uma.
When Vesemir returns, head back up to the guest room and talk to Yennefer to let her know you found the disturbance and what it was. She will assume Lambert did that on purpose, and you have the choice to quip that he knew what he was doing, or that he knows nothing about megascopes. Regardless of your answer, after this, Yennefer will prepare to make her call and tell Geralt to behave himself. Now, Yennefer and Geralt will converse with Ida Emean aep Sivney about Uma's curse and the White Frost. You will be given a few different dialogue options, which can be 'right', earning straight answers and no consequences, or, picking any of the wrong ones will earn you immediate disdain followed by a reprimand after Ida's call.
The correct conversation options are as follows:
Caed'mil, Aen Saevherne.
(Optional) Know the dialect?
Heard the words before, haven't you?
What's the problem?
After the conversation with Ida, if you picked the wrong conversation options, Yennefer will ask Geralt to apologize for his behaviour to which he can agree or not. If you got them all right, it goes right into the standard dialogue. Needing to apologize or not, you can ask Yennefer if she understood all that, and if you chose the optional ""Know the dialect"" prompt, about the great Migration that was mentioned, then the progressive ""What now?"", which will lead you into the end of the conversation and onward to complete the other tasks if you haven't already of the umbrella quest Ugly Baby.","Find and help Yennefer.
Return to Yennefer.
Find the source of the magical disturbance using the potestaquisitor.
Let Yennefer know you removed the source of the disturbance."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/To_Bait_a_Forktail...,Act_II,"The quest starts exactly at the Kaer Morhen fast travel point, so if you use another point to teleport there, the quest will immediately update. Use your witcher senses to find horse tracks and follow them. Eventually you will reach Eskel's horse Scorpion.
Search the area there and if you need enhanced draconid oil, make sure to examine the dish there so you can pick it up, as it will be gone later. Then look for Eskel's and a goat's tracks and follow them a short distance until they disappear due to the rocky path. Geralt will then decide to use the smell of the goat instead and you can examine the nearby tree to pick up its scent. Follow that, maybe having to kill a few wolves attracted by the wildlife. You will soon find new footprints and hoofprints to follow, and you can probably already hear the goat. The tracks eventually split, and you'll find Eskel there anyway, but the introduction differs if you go for the goat first instead of him just around the tree.
After a short conversation, the forktail will appear and you have to fight it. Once its health goes down by around 50%, it will fly away and you will have to chase it, but that's pointless. Use witcher senses to find a trail of blood, which will lead you to a cave. Inside you will find the Forktail again and this time it can't run away. After you finish it off, as you exit the cave, Eskel will propose a race back to the keep. You can refuse if you wish, but even then you'd still have to go on horseback. If you agree and beat Eskel, you'll be awarded 200 and he will offer you a prize, which again you can kindly refuse or accept.
If you accept, he'll give you Mountain Folk boots and Manuscript page: Hanged Man's Venom. If you refuse, Geralt will just ask Eskel to buy him a round next time they meet, but nothing like that happens further in the game.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Final_Trial,Act_II,"Talk to Lambert he will tell you about heading out to fill the Phylactery with energy using a Circle of Elements. You may go with him immediately or tell him you still have something to do. Now follow Lambert. On the way, you will come across some Harpies. You can technically avoid them and run towards the lake, but Lambert has some rare compliments for Geralt during the fight, especially if you use the crossbow.
After the harpies are dealt with, keep following Lambert to the hut near the lake. Lambert's boat will be gone and you will have to search for it. You'll find it northwest from your location, but you'll first have to fight some drowners followed by a bilge hag. After disposing of them hop on the boat and sit on the other end. After reaching your destination, you will hear a boy screaming and you can choose to investigate, in which case you will be forced to kill some foglets, or do as Lambert suggests and ignore it. It is entirely optional.
Old Speartip[]
While traversing the cave you will find walls that can be broken with Aard, however that would wake Old Speartip, so instead you can climb nearby ledges to avoid that. If you reach Old Speartip without waking him up Lambert will suggest making sure he ""never wakes up."" You don't have to fight him, if you didn't wake him up already, but if you try to sneak up on him, he will wake up when you get too close and Lambert will be overjoyed for once. If you intend to fight then get your Ogroid oil ready and anything else you need. Causing burning with Igni is also very effective. Once he is dead Lambert will spit on his remains and you can go, but note that there are a few treasure chests around, including in a neighbouring cave chamber.
The Circle of Elements[]
After leaving the cave, Lambert will tell Geralt about Trolls. You will have two ways to respond: if you pick the first option, Lambert will mention what Vesemir told him about Geralt saving a girl from Nilfgaardian soldiers. If you choose the second option, Geralt will mention the events leading to his ""death."" Regardless, nearby you will find a Place of Power, so feel free to use it. Move forward and you will see a troll running away. Once you get close enough, a conversation will start, and Lambert will suggest Geralt does the honors. Unfortunately, even if you try to play nice, Lambert's big mouth will ruin it, and the trolls will start throwing rocks, so you have to run into the nearby cave. Inside you will find a wall you can destroy with Aard. Once you pass the small cave, you will be conversing with the trolls again. If you try to resolve the situation in a diplomatic way, the trolls will agree to let you pass if you leave your swords there. If you agree Lambert won't be happy, but otherwise you will have to fight the trolls.
Important: If you decide to attack the trolls, Geralt will draw his steel sword, so make sure to manually draw silver.
Note: If you give up your swords by taking the peaceful option, but then follow 2 of the trolls up the hill opposite of the objective, you will find the cave they are living in with some loot. They will warn you not to go inside, but if you do anyway, they all become hostile. This becomes a harder fight since you have no weapons on you. They will also attack if you take back your weapons from the tree stump. The trolls will not object to you looting the cave once the quest is finished, however.
If you are worried you will need your swords for when you reach the Circle then fear not, there will be no fighting involved. Now move forward and you will reach the circle and start conversing with Lambert, who will tell Geralt to light up the torches and place the Phylactery on the altar. After that you will be conversing with Lambert again while the Phylactery is getting charged. When you're done talking, it's time to go back and you can choose to go immediately or stay there to explore. Regardless, the quest ends here. (500)","Find Lambert.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/No_Place_Like_Home,Act_II,"After Geralt and Yennefer figure out how to release Uma from the curse, they team up with Lambert, Eskel and Vesemir to talk about Uma. Vesemir states that he will try a method to release Uma, and will be away in the woods around Kaer Morhen. While he is away, Geralt, Yennefer, Lambert and Eskel start talking about various subjects. In the dialogues, answer the way you want, as it changes the reaction of the characters. At the end of the conversation, Yennefer will call Geralt to talk alone.
Depending on your actions on The Last Wish quest, there may be two consequences: If the player replied that he loves Yennefer during this quest, she will ask Geralt to have an intimate moment, which you can accept or not; If you have said that you no longer want to be with her, this dialog does not trigger. Regardless, the two return to talk a little more with Lambert and Eskel. Yennefer says she's tired and goes to bed, while Geralt accompanies her to the bedroom if they are still a couple, or otherwise just raids the kitchen.
Upon returning, the witcher encounters his two friends talking about a Samovila contract Eskel got some time ago. Time goes on while talking and drinking, and eventually you can choose to go to bed or stay a bit more. Important: This choice may be presented multiple times, but if you do opt to go to sleep at any point, the quest will end, skipping all remaining activities and the optional  reward.
Asking about the samovila will only result in more dialogue and banter. You can also play gwent, which will count as playing Lambert as part of Gwent: Old Pals if you haven't challenged him already (it doesn't matter if you bet money). However, the choice you really don't want to miss is ""Let's have some fun."" Note that, when you choose that option, all other remaining ones will be skipped, so leave it for last if you're not in a hurry.
If you decided to have fun, the three witchers will first play ""never have I ever"" while getting even more drunk, before their booze runs out and Eskel goes to fetch more. After another small conversation, Geralt and Lambert notice him missing and now you have to find Eskel. It's not hard to find his tracks with spilled alcohol around them, and they will lead you just outside the keep, where you find Eskel drunk asleep on the floor with his Lil' Bleater beside him. (500)
As you wake him up, Lambert will propose using Yennefer's megascope to invite her sorceress friends to the party. At this point, you can safely decline to end the quest without missing on rewards. However, if you do agree with Lambert, the trio will go upstairs to use the megascope and depending on your choice, can even dress up as women in order to ""blend in"". Aside from the obvious fun, this choice only affects if the person you contact recognizes you as witchers, or thinks the Lodge is out to get him. Either way, Yennefer will eventually appear and send you all to bed, completing the quest.","Proceed to Kaer Morhen's main hall.

"https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Va_Fail,_Elaine",Act_II,"As Geralt wakes up, everybody else is already gathered and it's time to lift Uma's curse. Yennefer will ask you to brew The Decoctions of the Grasses. For that, Geralt needs Mandrake, Ribleaf, Bryonia, Albino bruxa tongue, Manticore poison gland and Forktail spinal fluid which you acquired during To Bait a Forktail... The first 3 you may already have, but regardless you will find all 6 in a small chest nearby, so no need to worry if you are missing any of the common ingredients.
Just brew the potions from your alchemy tab and bring them to Yennefer. The rest is entirely scripted and the few dialogue choices make no difference. After the curse is lifted, Uma is revealed to be Avallac'h, who gives Geralt a Magic firefly to follow into the Isle of Mists. The witchers and Yennefer then quickly plan their next move before Geralt sets off to recruit allies and find Ciri. When the conversation ends, this quest and Ugly Baby will complete.
Note: A lot of quest notifications follow the completion of this one, simply because Ugly Baby completes and The Isle of Mists starts. Refer to those two pages for further info.","Gather the necessary ingredients and brew the Decoctions of the Grasses.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Brothers_In_Arms:_Velen,Act_II,"Note: this quest will fail if you do not send Keira Metz to Kaer Morhen at the end of her storyline (see below).
This quest, along with the three other Brothers in Arms quests for each region, is received after learning where Ciri is. It takes Geralt to Velen where he must find allies for the impending battle against the Wild Hunt.
The one ally to ask for help in Velen is Keira Metz, whom you would have already met before. If you have already completed the secondary quests An Invitation from Keira Metz, A Towerful of Mice, A Favor for a Friend, and For the Advancement of Learning, this quest is trivial as it auto-completes because Keira's fate has already been decided. Otherwise, you must first complete the four aforementioned quests in order to finish Keira's storyline.
Whether or not you gain her as an ally, however, depends on the outcome of the fourth quest, For the Advancement of Learning. In order to have Keira as an ally, in that quest you must be friendly to her and convince her to go to Kaer Morhen.
Note: Letho may also be recruited as an ally by completing Ghosts of the Past, provided that he was not killed in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. However, he is not part of this quest and recruiting him isn't required for the Full Crew achievement/trophy either.","Talk to Keira Metz.

However, she will want your help with Now or Never and it's recommended that you do that. If you already completed her questline, she will already be checked on the list, otherwise you get red marks and at Kaer Morhen she will say that Geralt has Yennefer to thank for recruiting her.
Zoltan Chivay will similarly always agree and only needs to be asked. He will provide services as an armorer at Kaer Morhen, though only at an Amateur skill level and thus probably only useful for repairs. Important: if A Dangerous Game isn't completed before you ask Zoltan for help, it will fail as soon as you do - he departs immediately and will not ask for optional help.
Sigismund Dijkstra will not join for the battle. However, if you managed to get information about his treasure from Caleb Menge during Count Reuven's Treasure, he will agree to give you a ""fat purse"" and you will receive 50 / 1,000 , Greater Devana runestone, Greater Stribog runestone and Diagram: Tracker's gauntlets.
Vernon Roche will join only if you do (or already have completed) An Eye for an Eye and only if Ves survives the quest. She will follow Roche on his way to Kaer Morhen and also joins the battle. If you already did the quest, just talk to him.

For the rest, you have to start by completing Possession and The Lord of Undvik, which makes Crach available since in doing so Geralt helped his children. He can't actually help with recruits, but will give the Winter's Blade sword instead.
Cerys or Hjalmar are ... stubborn in their pursuit of the Skellige throne, and won't commit to help before that matter is settled, meaning that you have to complete the entire questline ending with the Coronation quest. This does also mean that one of them has to be crowned as the new ruler - if King's Gambit is completed by leaving them both to investigate on their own, Coronation can't start and this quest will be stuck on the objective to help resolve the throne succession matter, which can only fail after that.
Cerys is a peculiar one, in that she actually promises to help as soon as the new ruler is chosen, appearing as if she might join the battle herself. After the coronation however, she is too busy with the islands regardless of who was crowned. If she becomes queen though, at least she says she is giving you her best warrior, her brother Hjalmar, though what she says doesn't really matter for him.
Hjalmar, regardless of whether he became king or not, feels indebted to Geralt and agrees to join. Note: If you also saved Folan and/or Vigi the Loon during The Lord of Undvik they will tag along too.

He promises to pledge soldiers to fight as long as they are led by Morvran Voorhis, which Geralt does not agree to and leaves the room, ending the quest.",Talk to Emhyr var Emreis.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Isle_of_Mists_(quest),Act_II,"While the thick of it doesn't start until you travel to the Isle of Mists, this quest actually begins immediately after Uma's curse is lifted, and it has four subquests that also start at that point:
Brothers In Arms: Nilfgaard
Brothers In Arms: Novigrad
Brothers In Arms: Skellige
Brothers In Arms: Velen (may auto-complete if finished Keira Metz' questline)
Before sailing to the island, make sure to gather as many allies as possible through those, but now is also the time to complete any remaining secondary quests below your current level (see Cutoff Point section). Recruiting all possible allies (except Letho) will award 50 as part of this quest, but later an extra 1,000 is given at the start of The Battle of Kaer Morhen as well (because of all the cutscenes, this can be mistaken as part of this quest, but it isn't). In addition, travelling to the island will lock you into an uninterruptible sequence of main quests that will award a total of 10,000. Thus, you may want to complete a few more quests above level 22 as well, as you may only get 5% from them afterwards.
Packing slightly higher level equipment and a few weapon, armor repair kits (whether on you or in the stash) is also a good idea, as gear maintenance will become limited for a while.
When certain that you are ready to go, travel to Skellige and take one of the three marked boats on your minimap (others won't work). Once you do you can fast travel with your boat to Undvik to make the trip shorter (there are a number of smuggler caches and other treasure locations en route if you take the long way, but this increases the chances of the boat being destroyed and at this point you might not want to be weighed down with discovered weapons).
When near your destination, the game will ask if you wish to save it as this is a vital moment in the story. Do so if you wish, and right after it will ask you if you are certain you wish to go (with the recommendation of being no lower than Level 22). After you agree, Geralt will release the Magic firefly and you are moved to the Isle of Mists.
Follow the firefly[]
The firefly's movement can be a bit erratic and take you very close to rocks, so just make sure you don't crash your boat, but keep following it. Eventually you will encounter a couple of Ekhidnae, so use the Hornwall horn or your crossbow to get rid of them (you can do so while still moving the boat), though you could ignore them and just take some damage to the boat. Shortly after, you will reach the shore and now you have to follow the firefly on foot. Along the way you may encounter some tangalores (strong foglets), so deal with them however you like. Soon you will reach a hut and the firefly will stop there. Knock on the door.
Ciri and the 7 dwarves[]
Chests around the isle
Inside the hut are a few scared dwarves, who won't let Geralt in before he finds their friends Ivo, Gaspard and Ferenc. Off you go to search for them, but feel free to explore the island as well - you're only here for the duration of this quest and there are some treasures sprinkled around, mostly around the landing and northeastern shores, though a lot of them only contain runestones.
Ferenc you can find on the southwestern peninsula, already dead. A Fiend will have its lair there, so you have to avenge him before examining his body to complete the objective. It's possible to avoid the monster, either if you're really quick in examining the body or if you lure the fiend away, but that isn't easy to do and requires very precise timings.
Ivo is sitting high on a rock arch north of the hut, with a couple of Bilge hags below him. There are also harpies on the pathway between him and the hut, though they can be avoided if you went to explore and approach from the north. He will yell out to you once you're close enough and a short cutscene will start, with him falling to his death while talking to Geralt.
Gaspard is the only one you save. He's at the lighthouse northwest from Ivo. Climb the ladders to the top to find him sleeping there. Wake him up and converse a bit, and you can choose to explore some more before coming back for him if you want. When you agree to escort him to the hut, you will have to kill a few more tangalores on the way, as well as wake him up from his narcolepsy attacks a couple of times. If you haven't found the other two dwarves yet, he'll wait by the hut once you reach it.
Note: If you wish to explore the island, then it's best to do it either before escorting Gaspard, or to leave one to find after him. You won't get another chance when you're in front of the hut and all three are found.
After you're all done and in front of the door, the dwarves will come out. However, they tell Geralt that Ciri is laying cold inside and the spirit has left her. A cutscene starts as they head for the boat and Geralt goes in to find her lifeless body. Devastated, he hugs her one last time, but as he does this, the firefly comes in and into Ciri, waking her and she embraces him back. You can then have a long conversation with her, recapping most of her story so far plus some tales of her travels between worlds. Feel free to talk about everything, despite being pushed for time by the Wild Hunt, everything is scripted.
When done, the two head to join the dwarves at the beach, only to see them sailing away in your boat. The Wild Hunt then appears and Geralt urges Ciri to teleport them home. Another long cutscene follows with Ciri and Geralt appearing at Kaer Morhen. First Vesemir, then Yennefer and finally Triss come to greet you and after all dialogues are over the quest ends.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Battle_of_Kaer_Morhen,Act_II,"The quest starts immediately after The Isle of Mists, after you are greeted by Vesemir, Yennefer and Triss. When you finish your conversations with them, the two sorceresses will walk towards the keep, but following them is entirely optional and you are free to roam until you join them for the council. However, fast travelling is disabled, so you can only do some side quests in the Kaer Morhen valley and would have to do so on foot, as calling Roach is also disabled.
If you've gathered all possible allies, which means getting all green marks on the ""Brothers in Arms"" quests and only Letho doesn't count towards this, an extra 1,000 will be awarded. This should include completing Now or Never, even though Triss will always join - if her questline isn't completed, she will explicitly say that it was Yennefer who invited her and Geralt should thank her.
On your way to the council, you can have short conversations with every ally except the sorceresses. Most of them are of course optional recruits, but here are all of them in a linear fashion of appearance:
Hjalmar is seen first and will have Folan and/or Vigi the Loon with him, if you saved them during The Lord of Undvik.
Zoltan Chivay is providing armorer services. He's only an Amateur armorer though, so that's mostly useful just for repairs and selling junk equipment you may've picked up.
Ermion can be seen together with Vesemir, opening cracks in the ground. If you wait for them to finish, they can be interacted with for some extra dialogue.
Lambert is trying to repair the ballista in the middle courtyard and Eskel is meditating just a bit further ahead.
Vernon Roche and Ves are training in the inner courtyard.
Letho, if alive and recruited, can make his appearance in two different ways. If Roche and Ves are there, he'll appear while you're talking to them, otherwise Lambert and Eskel will be in their spot as Letho walks around. In both cases, your other allies will be furious that you brought him, but it's just dialogue with no real consequences.
Ciri can also be talked to, next to the pendulum where you also first see her at the start of the game.
Keira Metz can be found just inside the keep and you can use The Eye of Nehaleni to try and dispell her illusionary dresser for a comic reaction. After talking to her, you can have another, regular conversation with her, allowing to use her as an alchemist.
Note: If you do open Keira's alchemist inventory, a bug may occur afterwards where the conversation options don't show. They are simply invisible and you can use the arrow keys and then Enter to exit the conversation.
When you're ready, approach the main hall in the keep to begin the council.
The council[]
Once you begin, after some introductory dialogue you'll have to make a couple of choices. First is how to use the laboratory:
Make more potions and you'll later receive 50, Superior Swallow, Thunderbolt and a Lesser Perun runestone
Make witcher's traps, in which case some of them will be spread in the courtyard and explode as enemies tread on them
Then how to use the workshop tools:
Patch up the walls, which will close Savolla's breach and you'll face fewer enemies during the battle
Clear the armory and you'll later receive the Rose of Shaerrawed silver sword
Note: If you already have a strong silver sword, then you obviously don't need a new one, especially since the one you can get here is of random level and may be disappointing. Naturally, enemies will also fall easier and thus you can take the more profitable potions option without much worry.
You will have the option to change those decisions before you move on to the next topic, then everyone else explains what they bring into the battle before Vesemir summarizes everything, ending the meeting. (500) In the next cutscene, Lambert will give you any previously chosen ""rewards"" and goes to prepare your horses.
Important: This is now your last opportunity to prepare for the battle and the next two quests as well. Remember that you are locked into a string of quests and even after this battle will have very limited access to everything. Take any repair kits and other equipment you'd like to use from your storage - you won't be able to do that for a long time afterwards.
Talk to Ciri if you wish (she can be seen sullenly leaning against a table annoyed at being told to stay inside (Geralt's responses do not make a difference), but she ultimately ends the conversation with a warm hug for Geralt before beginning to do some sword exercises. You can also loot some new crates with herbs and one with a formula and a diagram (the latter being useless right now as Zoltan is inaccessible), but more importantly two barrels will have ready-made White Gull, allowing to make more alchemy products at the last minute. There is also an armor table and grindstone for buffing armor and weapons (but be sure to visit them after talking to Ciri - see Bugs, below).
When you're ready, head out to join Lambert and as you exit the keep, a cutscene starts and the battle will begin. Note that none of the enemies ahead will give , so there's no point in trying to farm them. Also, take note that manual saving is disabled once Geralt approaches the doorway and for the duration of the battle (though automatic checkpoint saving still takes place)
The hunting party[]
When it begins, you'll be in the woods with Lambert and if he's present, Letho too. You have to close 3 portals through which the Wild Hunt soldiers are teleporting in, as well as defeat the handful of enemies near each portal. If you paid attention you will know you have 2 options - throw Dimeritium bombs or cast the Yrden sign on them.
The best approach before engaging the enemies is to walk into the portals and cast Yrden, saving the bombs for later and preventing more enemies from teleporting in. It's not a big deal if you lose the invisibility before that, but don't walk too close to the hounds if you want to avoid it happening. If you close the first two portals and kill the enemies quickly enough, there is time to loot the bodies for some uncommon goods (this opportunity is not available after the closing the last portal, however).
When all three portals are closed you receive 200 and then follows a cutscene with Imlerith appearing and the next phase begins. (500)
Note: If you close the last portal before starting to fight (particularly via Yrden and while still invisible), you might jump directly into the next quest phase and this fails the ""Kill the Wild Hunt warriors"" objective for that portal. This is a way to skip one fight, but it also gives a red mark in the objectives log.
Ciri helping Triss[]
You'll now be playing as Ciri and will have to help Triss (before this, however, there will be a timed response moment with Vesemir, but it doesn't seem to matter what response is chosen). Ciri has the option to use a magic amulet in order to direct Triss' fireballs; take care though as they will damage Ciri as well, so blink away once you use the amulet. Ciri can now also use her Charge attack, making her charge through her enemies, dealing high damage and stunning them. The longer you hold the key the higher the damage she will deal. Follow the wall of the keep to reach Triss and after you kill all enemies around her you will return to Geralt and his team.
Return to the keep[]
After the cutscenes, Geralt will be on Roach now and will have to return to the keep as soon as possible. The raining fireballs can actually hurt you, or even one-shot kill with a direct hit (despite Lambert's comments), but don't worry about them and simply gallop. (This is an automatically saved checkpoint if Geralt is unlucky in his timing). After reaching the keep, you will have to close the main gate. If Ermion has been recruited, you will have gas deposits you can ignite with Igni. Kill the immediate group of enemies if you wish (you may have no choice because climbing is disabled when Geralt is in combat mode), but don't bother with any more as they will spawn infinitely from the gate. Once you are able to, climb the wall (or follow the marked path if Geralt will not exit combat mode, a known bug), reach the lever, and pull it to close the gate. If you stay and attract more enemies, they'll prevent you from climbing the shortcut and you'll have to run a long way around.
Saving Lambert (dependent)[]
Lambert will be surrounded by enemies and need help. If Keira was recruited, she will automatically intervene and save him, but otherwise you have to run to his aid. If that's the case, do not run the walls, but drop down as quickly as you can and kill the enemies before they can kill him.
Retreat[]
With Yennefer's spell waning and the White Frost advancing, Geralt has to retreat to the middle courtyard to get shelter. Run for it and don't try to loot corpses or the frost will kill you. After you reach the first gate (500), kill all enemies you see and move for the second gate, where unfortunately Eskel will be in trouble and unable to open it. While the issue is being resolved, you have to help Triss instead. Kill enough enemies near her to trigger the next cutscene. There is a sense of urgency here, but nothing happens if you take your time, so don't worry.
Helping Eskel[]
Eskel is fighting Caranthir and it's not going well, so Ciri jumps in to help. Eventually Caranthir retreats and you will be playing as Ciri again. Help Eskel kill the rest of the Wild Hunt around and then run to open the gate. Keep killing everyone you encounter if you must and then use the wheel to open the gate. It can be tricky to interact with, but don't panic - the objective marker isn't wrong. When you do, you'll be back to Geralt.
Closing the Portals[]
This part is exceptionally easy with many allies around and there is no time limit or penalties if you tarry.
Like in the woods, you have to use Dimeritium bombs or Yrden to close the portals, but this time you can pick up more bombs from crates. You will have the optional objective to pick up more Dimeritium bombs if you are all out. Note: In older versions of the game, if you already created enhanced or superior versions of the bombs, then these basic ones would replace them and you'd have to remake them later.
When you're done with the portals, Triss will request aid and the battle will end once you get close to her.
All is lost... or is it?[]
The Wild Hunt breaches in, freezing almost everyone including Geralt. Only Vesemir manages to protect Ciri for a short spell, but he too is eventually restrained by Imlerith.
Ciri's deadly scream
Eredin will finally appear and convinces Ciri to give up. When all seems lost, Vesemir stabs Imlerith with a dagger in a desperate last effort, but only gets himself killed for it. This causes Ciri to give in to despair and let her power run wild with a deadly scream that decimates the Wild Hunt. Realizing the battle is lost, Caranthir creates a portal for the surviving warriors to retreat through. Eredin, hellbent on capturing Ciri, tries to grab her but is almost consumed by her burst of power until he is literally dragged into the portal by Caranthir. Ciri's out of control powers now endanger her own allies, but fortunately Avallac'h appears and manages to incapacitate her. (1,000 )
Geralt and the rest will thaw out and after the sad reality hits him, he will have a short talk with Ciri. You can pick whichever dialogue options you like and then the funeral for Vesemir and possibly Lambert begins. During it, Ciri will decide she has been running away for too long and takes Vesemir's wolf medalion before the quest ends and Blood on the Battlefield starts.","Enter Kaer Morhen keep and begin the council.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_on_the_Battlefield,Act_II,"The quest starts immediately after The Battle of Kaer Morhen, at the funeral. You can interact with anyone present, Vesemir's body included, and Lambert's too if he didn't survive the battle. There's nothing else to do except talk to the rest of your allies and you can say whatever you want.
Eskel will decide it's time to leave Kaer Morhen for good. Mousesack will be returning to Skellige soon, but will tend to the wounded and leave some medicine before he does. Zoltan Chivay will tell Geralt it's time to counter-attack. Vernon Roche and Ves will be in awe of what they just witnessed. Hjalmar will also be going back to Skellige, while Vigi the Loon and Folan unfortunately didn't survive (if they came) and don't have anything said or done about them except their journal entries. Letho will say it's time for him to go, though he accepts if you offer him to stay, but you won't see him again.
Keira Metz and Lambert are a bit more special here. Obviously because it's possible that Lambert dies if she's not around, but if she is they will leave together and later become a couple. If Keira didn't come, Lambert will simply be very upset.
Once you are done with the people around the pyre, go to the quest marker where Avallac'h will be arguing with Yennefer about teaching Ciri to control her powers, with Triss sitting next to them. Avallac'h will say that stronger forces are needed for the next encounter and Yennefer will propose seeking the Lodge of Sorceresses. Ciri will be angry that she is excluded from the plans as always and then leave when Avallac'h says that she must learn to control her powers. You have a couple of dialogue choices here, but they don't matter and you'll be stopped if you want to follow Ciri. The sorceresses will leave for Novigrad and the next scene is a few days later. (1,000)
Few days later[]
Ciri has problems mastering her powers and Avallac'h will look to Geralt to help resolve the matter. You will now have two dialogue options with Ciri in a timed reaction:
Relax. You don't have to be good at everything. (you'll have a drink with her)
Think I know what might lift your spirits. (starts a snowball fight)
Important: This is the first of several decisions that count towards deciding Ciri's fate at the end of the game. The first option contributes towards a negative ending, while the second contributes towards a positive ending. If you wish to have a positive ending, pick the option to lift her spirits.
The game will subsequently give a strong hint for the consequences. A snowball fight is naturally a jovial event, but if you have a drink, during the following conversation you can see a cat consuming a swallow. Note that this dialogue is only the first deciding factor of the game, and it is still possible to achieve any ending after this point. It only provides the first value for a sum of positive and negative scores.
Snowball Fight![]
If this was your choice, Geralt will now be ""fighting"" Ciri and you have to pick up snow and throw it at her. The first to score 8 hits wins. If you wish to win, remember that Ciri can blink around so it's best to dodge her snowballs and only throw them when she stops to make her own snowballs. It is very easy even if you just mostly stay in place, as she'll eventually stop somewhere with her back towards you, just waiting to be hit.
To Bald Mountain[]
Ciri will wake Geralt early to tell him they are leaving to attend the sabbath on Bald Mountain where Imlerith will be the guest of honor. Thus, you'll have a chance to avenge Vesemir. Before you go however, you can tell Ciri that she may first want to see her father or not. If you make the proposal Ciri will ask Geralt if he thinks she should see him. You can then tell her to decide herself, but ultimately it will be Geralt who has to decide.
Important: This is the second decision that can affect Ciri's fate. Seeing the Emperor is a requirement to unlock the ""Empress"" ending, though again it's not guaranteed.
Vizima (optional)[]
If you decided to see Emhyr, Ciri will remark they can pass Vizima along the way to Bald Mountain. When you arrive and meet the Emperor, he will offer you the rest of the promised reward for finding Ciri and you will have another timed choice:
Thanks. Definitely need it more than you do. (4,000  and bill of exchange)
Didn't do this for the coin. (you'll be given a new black stallion Roach)
The bill of exchange can supposedly be cashed in for 100,000  after the war ends, but you'll never get to do that.
Important: This is the next pivotal decision that can affect Ciri's fate. Accepting the Emperor's reward will cause Ciri to resent Geralt and will contribute to a negative ending, whereas rejecting the coin will cause Ciri to be happy over Geralt's choice and would contribute to a positive ending.
After visiting Vizima or not, you will reach the Road to Bald Mountain and the quest ends with a small conversation there.","Talk to Avallac'h about what to do next. (1,000 )
If Geralt chooses snowball fight:
Don't let the snowballs hit you. (0/8)
Defeat Ciri in a snowball fight. (0/8)
Make more snowballs.
Return to Ciri when you're ready to hit the road."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Bald_Mountain_(quest),Act_III,"After you arrive at Road to Bald Mountain, you can use your Witcher Senses to see and examine a lot of footprints to follow, but the path is pretty obvious. Climb the path and once you get close enough you'll meet a guard taking his role a bit too seriously and an elder peasant named Stregomir. The latter will note that Geralt had once served the Ladies and you can join them at their fireplace for a conversation if you wish. If you do, Stregomir will tell you more about the sabbath and magic acorns. Regardless of your choices though, he will direct you to Thecla if you wish to see the Ladies. Along the way to her, you will find two minor merchants and a blacksmith, so you can offload some junk and do repairs if needed.
Thecla[]
Just a bit ahead, you will meet Johnny and possibly Sarah if you evicted her during Novigrad Dreaming. Among other things, he will tell you more about Thecla and warn you that, while Ciri is young enough to be allowed to meet the Ladies, Geralt is not. When you're done talking to him, proceed to the tent where Thecla is.
When you meet her, in a rather creepy fashion but as predicted, she will immediately choose Ciri and reject Geralt. The witcher protests and is presented with a challenge to prove himself worthy: retrieve the Defier's Oren from a deep and murky lake.
This is very easy, especially if you use Killer Whale. Drop down into the waters and shoot the two drowners there before diving deeper and the objective marker will show exactly where the coin is. There's also a treasure chest near it, as well as a second cave to explore, but nothing of note in it. Return to the water surface the way you came and as you climb out, you'll see the real threat to your left - a fiend who like the drowners was ""conveniently"" not mentioned. Geralt will notice it, but while it is scripted to appear, it's merely guarding another cave with minor amounts of orens as loot and it won't attack if you don't approach it. However you chose to deal with the monster, return to Thecla and she will agree to let Geralt pass. (300)
Fugas[]
Follow Marica, who will unlock the gates for you. They will close and lock behind you, and there's a minor bit of extra dialogue if you try to open them. A short distance ahead you will encounter Fugas, a sylvan guarding the way to the top. Just like Thecla, he will simply allow Ciri in, but then when shown the Defier's Oren, he declares it to be a death sentence and attacks.
Put on your relict oil and kill him. Ciri will help, but take care to avoid his flaming breath. For some reason, you can get two ""burning"" status effects simultaneously, and this can deplete your health fast. If you're having trouble, stand back a bit - he'll focus on Ciri and she's both invulnerable and perfectly capable of killing him on her own, it just takes a long time. After he is dead, a cutscene will follow where Geralt and Ciri argue over who gets to kill Imlerith, and they end up playing ""Rock Paper Scissors"" for it. Geralt wins the 2 out of 3 and Ciri is left to deal with the Crones instead.
The Crones[]
You will now be controlling Ciri. Continue forward and you will find a waterfall. After examining it, Ciri will deduce she has to jump down there, so do just that and swim a short distance to find the Crones. They look ""different"" and are cooking dinner, but as soon as Ciri crashes the party they turn back to their beastly form and it's time to fight them.
Remember this is 3 against 1, so make use of her Blink ability. Charge is also useful, but mostly against the Brewess, as the other two can temporarily phase out of material form and avoid hits. Be patient and prioritize safety, they hit very hard. Once all three fall, there will be a cutscene where it turns out Weavess is still alive. She steals Vesemir's medalion from Ciri and flies away. The scene will then switch back to Geralt.
Looting the Crones (optional)[]
When you're back to Geralt, you'll be a bit further ahead at the end of the cave system, but it's possible to go back and loot the caves, including Fugas and the Crones. It's a lot of work for very little reward, but if you wish to do so, make a save here so you can easily resume if something goes wrong.
Head back to where you fought Fugas and this is the trickiest part. The path to him is blockaded, but it's possible to jump over. The easiest way to do it without pure luck is to climb just a bit on the broken wall to the right, after which jumping ahead is easy. When you succeed, loot Fugas for the Bald Mountain key, which unlocks the gates - if don't do that, you may get stuck and be unable to return. It's actually possible to have already looted the key just as Fugas dies, before the cutscene there triggers, but one has to be really fast and precise to do that.
With the key in hand, note that there are three exits. The lone one leads to the gates, so turn to face the other two beside each other - you want to enter the left one. Climb the ledge there to find yourself where you started as Ciri and follow the same path you did as her. Jumping down the waterwall is the point of no return.
When you reach the cave where you fought the Crones, there's nothing but the corpses of the two slain sisters and they only contain a few crafting materials and lesser glyphs. There's now another stone ledge to jump over, different from the way you came. Follow that path until you find a treasure chest containing a Forgotten vran sword and up to 2 random diagrams. When you jump down immediately after the chest, you can't climb back up and you'll be in the empty cave chamber that could be found while diving for the Defier's Oren.
Go ahead through the waters the same way you did to return the coin, and again all the way to the gates, which you can now unlock if you haven't already when you got the key from Fugas. Reach the same chamber where he was and this time climb into the right tunnel to continue towards Imlerith.
Imlerith[]
Now it's time to climb the mountain. Along the way you will find a Quen Place of Power, which is great as Quen is very useful during the battle. Follow the rocky path after it and then climb a ledge to reach the peak. When you reach Imlerith he will ask if you brought Ciri with you, but your answer doesn't matter and the fight starts then.
Like with all Wild Hunt warriors, you have to use your silver sword even though he's an elf. He's not that hard at first - his shield is annoying, but just roll around to stab him from behind. He will stagger Geralt if you try to get too many hits in one go, so dodge after 2-3 at most. Once he goes down to 33%HP, he will drop his shield and this is when he's truly dangerous.
He will then constantly swing his mace, while trying to teleport behind you and will have frost shielding applied. The shield you can burn with Igni and you'll probably have to cast a lot of signs anyway, so consuming Tawny Owl is a great idea (especially the superior version, since this takes place at night), but it's way more important to dodge his attacks and Quen is more useful (especially with Active Shield; if you have Exploding Shield too, it may even stagger him). Wait for openings between his teleports, when he will swing his mace into the ground and needs to gather his strength before lifting it - he is vulnerable then and you can get free swings.
When he is cut down to around 5% health, a cutscene will play where Imlerith lifts up Geralt like he did Vesemir, but this time the witcher will prevail - just enjoy the cinematic. (1,000)
The magic acorn[]
Soon Ciri will join Geralt and start conversing, after which you will have a choice to stay a bit longer or leave right away and end the quest. Important: if you leave now, you're missing on 2 skill points!
If you stay, you can go back to loot Imlerith's body for a magic acorn. It will go into your ""Food and drink"" and can be consumed for 2 skill points. Do this immediately, as it can later be given to the peasants instead and you would lose it then. There's no penalty for keeping it for yourself.
Note: It seems that the acorn will remain there forever, thus allowing you to pick it up later if you return, but why risk and wait?
When done, talk to Ciri or simply descend toward the caves. Either way, Stregomir will greet you and ask how will they manage without the acorns. If you have not used the acorn yet you can give it to him, but that's obviously not a great option for you, so pick the other one. Regardless, Ciri and Geralt will head for Novigrad where they will be greeted by their friends in Dandelion's establishment and the quest ends. This will start Final Preparations, but you are also finally free to roam the world again as you see fit.","Find a way to the mountain's summit.

However, this is also the lowest level quest of the four, so when you're ready to start - just go for it and meet Ge'els.
When you're done with that, Ciri will prompt you to help finish her business next, but you can delay if you wish. The only difference that makes is that you would later have to meet her during daytime. In case you haven't completed The Nobleman Statuette and/or The Soldier Statuette, you should go see Triss next and complete Blindingly Obvious, so that you can unlock her for free conversations again. However, it's more important to just not leave her quest for last.
If Keira's questline wasn't completed in full, or if Geralt allowed her to leave and parley with Radovid at the end of For the Advancement of Learning, a fifth main quest will be added as well - A Final Kindness. Though technically not a subquest, it will also be a requirement to complete before proceeding forward.
With that in mind, proceed however you wish and once you're done helping the three women, a new mission objective will appear: ""Meet Yennefer and the Lodge of Sorceresses at Dandelion's inn."" Go to the third floor to see Ciri anxious about a meeting that Philippa Eilhart and Margarita Laux-Antille want to have with her. After your initial response, you'll have 2 choices:
""Going with you.""
""You'll do fine on your own.""
Important: This decision will count towards deciding Ciri's fate at the end of the game. The first option contributes towards a negative ending, while the second contributes towards a positive ending. If you wish to have a positive ending, pick the second option and let her go alone.
If you let Ciri go in alone, Geralt encourages her beforehand, and you are shortly joined by Yennefer who starts snooping and sees Ciri give Philippa a piece of her mind. If you instead join the meeting, Geralt practically takes over the talking for Ciri, and among other things you will hear Philippa and Margarita offer her partnership in the reconvened Lodge. Whatever your decision was, after the meeting Ciri will need some time to think, while you receive 1,000.
At this point, it is possible that another ""subquest"" is added. If you have romanced both Triss and Yennefer simultaneously, when the meeting ends another cutscene will begin. Your two love interests wake you up on the next morning with a suspicious, but irresistible proposition, starting the main quest It Takes Three to Tango that you also must complete before this one ends.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Blindingly_Obvious,Act_III,"You start this quest by finding Triss upstairs at The Chameleon. She will be angry at Geralt for putting Ciri in danger, and you will have a timed dialogue with 3 responses to choose from, but nothing hangs on that. If you chose to romance her then Geralt will automatically kiss her after the explanation.
After explaining everything you will be able to ask about the Lodge of Sorceresses. Triss will explain that Philippa was tricked by an ex-lover, Arthur de Vleester, who advised her to turn into an owl to be safe. But after she transformed, he put a dimeritium ring on her leg so she couldn't change back. Arthur was killed during the mage hunt and his property was sold. She ended up as Zoltan Chivay's pet and was downstairs the whole time, only for him to lose her in a card game. With no clue on who got Philippa, Triss will attempt to use one of her feathers to track her down using hydromancy. For that, she will use the fountain behind the Passiflora. You will have the option to go immediately or meet her there.
From one ex-lover to another[]
At the fountain, it is revealed that Dijkstra has Philippa at his bathhouse and the two of you head there.
Note: If you chose to romance Triss, there will be another image and Geralt will ask her about it. She will reveal that she was offered the position of advisor to King Tankred Thyssen of Kovir, and the image was of the house that awaits you in Pont Vanis. If Geralt reacts negatively at first, you'll have the chance to learn more about Triss' political ambitions, but none of the dialogue choices have consequences - she'll always go there while also balancing that with Geralt's wishes.
On approach to the bath house you will hear an explosion. Philippa has already been unleashed inside and is out of control. Triss will stay behind and you have to chase Philippa while forced to fight Dijkstra's men, who she controls with her magic. Geralt will incapacitate them instead of killing them whether or not you use a sword, but you can just run past the first three and drop down the ladder. You will then face Bart, who is also under her spell. You can convince him to let you pass or kill him, but he doesn't drop any loot, so that's not worth doing.
Once you reach Philippa she will summon a Fire elemental and you will have to kill it while also avoiding her attacks. Incoming hits will be very hard, but also predictable, so just dodge as necessary. Important: Geralt may draw his steel sword here, so double check what you're using against the monster.
When the elemental is dead, go up the stairs while jumping the gap between them and ""sneak up"" (you can run, it's fine) behind Philippa to trigger a cutscene. Geralt will pin her down and finally calm her down, then return upstairs. There, Dijkstra will block your path and you will have to force your way through him or depending on your previous choices, try diplomacy by telling him Emhyr's plans.
Note: Choosing the diplomatic route will start the quest Reason of State, which will influence the game ending. To do so, first you need to choose ""I need her"" and later ""Tell you what the emperor's after if you let us go.""
You will then rejoin Triss who will teleport herself and Philippa away, ending the quest. (500)","Go to the fountain near the Passiflora.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Escape,Act_III,"When you meet with Yennefer in Crippled Kate's, she will ask whose idea was it to go after Imlerith. If you lie and say it was yours, she will reveal that she already knew it was Ciri's idea, but will praise Geralt for supporting Ciri regardless of your answer. After asking why she is at Crippled Kate's and about Margarita Laux-Antille, Yennefer will tell you that there is a man who escaped from Deireadh prison named Abbé Faria who is a regular there. The man will then enter, and after trying to talk to him, he will try to escape, and you have to catch him. It's kind of tricky to actually catch him, but you can use Aard or Axii instead when you are close enough to him. If you take too long, Yennefer will teleport and catch him herself.
Bug: While it's impossible to fail this chase, you should not try to go exploring too far as the quest markers may stop updating and you will have to find Abbé without their help.
Regardless, once he's caught you will return to Crippled Kate's and he will tell you everything you need to know. He will reveal that the guards like to drink while on duty and that it's possible to get in the same way he got out—through the sewers. Yen will propose using the Elven ruins that are connected to the sewers as a way into the prison. (200)
Breaking in[]
You will have the optional objective to ask Zoltan Chivay for help getting the guards drunk. However, if Now or Never was completed he will refuse as the Witch hunters are now targeting non-humans. If he can help, you'll just face a couple fewer guards inside the prison.
Whether or not you asked for Zoltan's help, meet Yennefer in Oxenfurt and she will lead you to the entrance into the ruins that she found: a previously blockaded well. When you reach it, she will also give Geralt a magic trinket that will allow her to teleport in when you find Margarita Laux-Antille. Jump inside the well and feel free to explore—there are worthwhile chests in almost every chamber, including in the waters. You may have to kill a couple of drowners, but they don't always spawn. Eventually, you'll encounter a grave hag guarding a stone door with a lever mechanism that's missing a handle. Just in the other room you will find an open door and you can take the handle from its mechanism, then go back with it to open the one you need.
Beyond the stone door there will be a breakable wall in front of you and another flooded section to your right. Behind the breakable wall you will encounter a rotfiend and three ghouls, which can be tricky to handle in the tight tunnels. When they're dealt with, follow the sewer down and then to your right, where you'll find a hole in the wall that will get you into the prison. The witch hunters there will not see you until you climb in, but will attack once you do, unless Zoltan helped and got them drunk. However you deal with them, you can find a sewer key in the same room—it opens the grate door on the opposite side in the sewers, so you can escape later, though you don't actually need to use that exit.
Margarita[]
The next room is the cell-block with more guards that you have to kill as well as Margarita. Note: If you spared Síle de Tansarville in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, she will also be in the cell. Rita tells Geralt that he needs the key from the Prison Warden and now follows the real action.
Go upstairs through the next door and you'll be right at the courtyard entrance, but there's also another room upstairs with a couple of more witch hunters and it's better to kill them off first. Once you enter the courtyard, the guards will ring the alarm bell and all will attack you—regular witch hunters, a couple of shield bearers, and some crossbowmen shooting you from the walls, with halberdiers possibly joining later. If you can kill them all quickly you may have to go and actually look for the warden, but he usually comes and joins the fight on his own. The alarm bell is actually ringing for reinforcements, but only one new enemy at a time will spawn at very long intervals until you kill everybody, or none at all if Zoltan is helping.
When the warden is dead and you loot him for the cell key (and possibly gwent cards, if you didn't get them during A Dangerous Game), you can go back the prison cells. Once you open Margarita's cell, Geralt will use the trinket from Yennefer, and she teleports in. If Síle is here, she will ask to die with dignity and either you or Yen will deliver the mercy kill. The two sorceresses will then teleport out and Geralt has to leave the prison on his own. (300)
Note: If you want to free the other prisoners, you have to unlock their cells first as you will lose the key once you free Margarita. Freeing them gives nothing, apart from their gratitude and Trapped mage's notes in one of the cells. They will move into the sewer you came from, but will remain there even after you open the exit gate.
You can actually just jump out through a hole in courtyard wall, right on the street, as if nothing happened. However, the intended way is to go back to the sewers and unlock the gate directly across from you, using the previously looted key. This will lead to the same section of sewer containing Diagram: Enhanced Feline trousers. If Zoltan was providing help, you have to meet up with him first, but otherwise the quest ends once you escape the prison. (300)","Catch the runaway. (200 )

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Payback,Act_III,"The quest is started by agreeing to help Ciri, either immediately after Through Time and Space, or by meeting her at the Gildorf market during daytime hours. Once you do Ciri she will inform you she wants to repay some debts, starting with revenge on Whoreson Junior. If you chose to kill him you can tell her that, however she will insist Zoltan Chivay told her he is still alive.
Meeting Whoreson[]
If you spared Whoreson, he will be a beggar living on the streets in The Bits and Ciri will decide to leave him in his misery.
If you killed Whoreson, you will be stopped by two guards at the door to his house. You can use Axii (requires Delusion level 3; 40) or fight them. However, if you choose the latter, the fight only continues until Ciri mentions your name, at which point the bandits recognize it and say Whoreson is expecting you. However you got in, follow Ciri to the top floor for a cutscene to trigger, with Whoreson appearing alive and well ... almost. You may recognize him by the scar or not, but he will say that he's Dudu and then prove it with different knowledge depending on your dialogue choice, after which you can talk to him a bit before leaving.
Whichever the case was, you get 200 as you move on to your next location.
Meeting Bea[]
Bea is a waitress at the The Golden Sturgeon. When you reach her she will be in trouble with some thugs. You can subtly threaten them, which would scare them off, or be more direct and start a fight. Regardless, you will now be conversing with Bea, who is clearly smitten by Geralt, but will flirt much more directly if you don't say who you are at first. Ciri then gives her a gift to her and you're moving on towards Farcorners. (200)
The Circus troupe[]
Follow Ciri to the west end of Farcorners where you'll meet Valdo and Aegar. The latter leaves to deal with some issue before Ciri attempts to repay Valdo back coin he'd lended her. The elf refuses though and proposes to make the money a pot for horse race instead. You can agree to join them or not, and this is probably the single race in the game where it makes no difference except some minor dialogue - despite there being a pot, you don't receive anything if you win, while losing or refusing doesn't even fail an objective.
Whether you raced or not, you will be invited to a celebration by a fireplace and have a bit of father-daughter talk. Soon Aegar will return with the bad news that they can't buy the horses he went to get and they will have to steal them. He will ask for help and Ciri immediately agrees, but you'll have the options to outright refuse, agree, offer to buy the horses yourself or ask what the payment issue is. If you inquire or offer to pay, you will learn that the owner is racist so he won't sell them no matter what, so now you can refuse or agree again.
If you refuse, you'll also be stopping Ciri from going and she'll be very upset. Aegar then starts a fistfight with Geralt and regardless of the outcome, you'll be asked to leave and the quest will complete here. (300) If you agree, Ciri will be overjoyed and you will be performing a heist.
Let's steal some Horses[]
If you agreed to steal horses, you'll now be at Silverton and have to find a way into the stables. Climb the western wall (right in front of you) through the crates and scaffolding there. Once inside you're supposed to be stealthy as to not wake up the sleeping guard.
To do this successfully, climb down the ladder and pick up the stable key just left of the door, then unlock it and you're done. It can go wrong if you jump down or otherwise make a lot of noise to spook the horses, in which case you'll have to fistfight the guard and calm 3 horses with Axii. The same thing happens if you for some reason physically touch the guard, although you can also just draw your sword and attack while he's sleeping instead of fistfighting.
No matter what happened though, after stealing the horses, you'll just have another short conversation and the quest completes. (300)","Wait for daylight.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Through_Time_and_Space,Act_III,"To start the quest, talk to Avallac'h about what you did on Bald Mountain. He will inform Geralt that his victory over Imlerith made him believe that they may have a chance at victory after all. He has a plan about one of Eredin's two remaining generals, Ge'els. Eredin had poisoned their former King Auberon Muircetach, to whom Ge'els was loyal and therefore could be convinced to withdraw his support. But of course, you need to find him first, by travelling with Avallac'h to the Aen Elle's capital Tir ná Lia.
After everything is explained, you'll have the option to go immediately or meet later, near the location of a portal to another world. It happens to be in the basement of the house where you previously met Sarah and Corinne Tilly. Once there, destroy the wall if you haven't previously and approach the portal.
Ddiddiwedht Desert[]
After entering the portal you will appear in a desert world. Follow Avallac'h to your destination and on the way he will explain that you're walking on a the bottom of a former ocean, which used to be a live being itself. There are also a few tree stumps that you can loot on the way, not detectable using Witcher Senses. Eventually you reach next portal, but you must wait for it to open and you've awakened Sandcrabs that you now have to kill. They will spawn infinitely, but the portal will open after the first wave, so jump in when it does and you will move to the next world.
Poisoned valley[]
Geralt will be separated from Avallac'h and will have to find the next portal himself. After walking down some stairs you will soon see the next portal and an Aard Place of power. Important: This is your only chance to get it so don't leave without it.
There will be poisonous fumes all around that will choke Geralt to death and Golden Oriole won't help here. You will have to run through them fast and take breaks on higher ground. After passing 2 poisoned areas you should reach the Place of power, around the corner to the right. From there move north, which is opposite of the direction to the portal, but the safe areas form a kind of a maze and you can't go straight for it.
Reach the lower ground, then pass another poisoned field and look to your left. You will see rocks that look like pillars, another poisoned field and higher ground that you need to reach. Now move in the direction of the portal past the next field and you will be able to climb much higher. You'll know you are in the right place as there will be a huge skeleton in the next field when you reach the top. Run through it to reach the next safe spot and the portal should be within your reach. Just pass one last field and you will reach it.
Note: Along the entire path, you may see lootable skulls on the walls. They will always be on safe grounds, but can only contain crystalized essences and lesser runestones. Don't bother trying to explore elsewhere - there's nothing but death.
Underwater[]
When you enter the portal, you'll be underwater in what looks like elven ruins. The next portal is very close ahead and there's no challenge in reaching it. If you want to get the 4 minor loot containers though, you may want to use Killer Whale - there's one immediately behind where Geralt spawns, two to the far left and one immediately next to the portal.
Ice Plains[]
When you arrive, Geralt will remark how cold it is and after a short walk will find an ice wall that needs to be broken with Aard, Igni, or a hit from a sword. While outside in the blizzard and not in cover, Geralt will be freezing and take continuous damage from the Snowstorm status effect that also prevents continous recovery of health from sources such as Swallow and eating food. The intended way to pass this section is to sprint from cover to cover and use campfires, stoves, and other sources of flame to recover health. Yes, lit fires here actually restore health.
The Quen sign helps a bit by providing a second or two of safety from the snowstorm before breaking, but if cast when Geralt is already freezing, it will break instantly.
Troll decoction is the best potion to recover vitality when sheltering in buildings etc. Take care not to stray past the very edges of the town, though, as the snowstorm will intensify and kill Geralt almost instantly.
Patch update: Prior to Patch 4.0, Ekhidna decoction was the best potion to use here as it allows recovery of vitality from actions that consume stamina, which used to include jumping, allowing one to explore everything with virtually no danger. However, after Patch 4.0, this is no longer as easy. Ekhidna decoction can still be utilized to great effect, such as by re-casting Quen after every few steps, but it no longer borders on immortality.
After just a couple of shelter locations, it may look like the next run is too challenging, but simply sliding down some distance will trigger a cutscene with Geralt exiting a house. The same thing happens if you manage to approach the front of the house from another direction. He will see an active lighthouse and remark that's probably where Avallac'h is. On the way to the lighthouse, you'll find containers of random loot, as well as notes and writings from travellers and prior inhabitants of the town, namely Traveler's notes, Anna's notes, and Ervyl's diary. In the lighthouse itself, a city secretary's diary can be found.
Depending on how you proceed to the lighthouse, you may encounter Hounds of the Wild Hunt along the way - two while inside a barn-like building if you decide to enter it, and three more in a clearing south-west of the lighthouse, surrounded by five lit braziers. (Inside the five lit braziers square area, you are not affected by the snowstorm effects). They won't appear before you're in the right spots, but the second group is more easily avoidable.
To proceed, you need to enter a chamber below the lighthouse, the entrance to which is located on the south-west side of the stone platform the lighthouse stands on. Inside you find Avallac'h warming himself by a fire and you can converse with him about various topics before the next portal opens. Among other things, Avallac'h will reveal that the frozen world they're in is the Ice Plains where Geralt previously fought Eredin's reflection. Once you've talked enough, end the conversation (500) and walk through the portal that appears.
Ge'els[]
At last you reach Tir ná Lia. Follow Avallac'h to find Ge'els. Along the way, you can pick up a report regarding the advance of the White Frost, sitting on a bench next to a fountain (there's no other loot in the entire place). When you reach Ge'els, he will be painting an elf girl in a Picassoesque style. A short conversation will ensue, during which Avallac'h convinces him to go with you and through an oneiromancer, witness the dream of Eredin poisoning their former king.
You then appear back in Novigrad, with Ciri around and Corinne Tilly to facilitate the dreaming. After witnessing the dream, Ge'els will tell you how to lure Eredin using the Sunstone and decides to withhold reinforcements for the Naglfar when the battle starts. Avallac'h then helps Ge'els return to Tir ná Lia and the quest ends after the Sage returns during a conversation with Ciri. (1,000 + 1,000)","Join Avallac'h.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Final_Kindness,Act_III,"When Geralt meets with Triss after killing Imlerith, she tells him about the lack of availability of the Lodge members. When Geralt suggests Keira, Triss tells him that Keira attempted to parley with Radovid, but he chose to execute her, by having her impaled. At this point, Geralt can suggest that Triss and he can retrieve Keira's body before finding Philippa, which will start this quest before Blindingly Obvious and it becomes a prerequisite before you can deal with that. Otherwise, Triss will ask Geralt for help after Philippa is retrieved.
However the quest was started, Geralt has to meet Triss at Hierarch Square. She says to do that around midnight, but finding her there as early as 9pm works. Talk to her and she'll ask Geralt to deal with the guards, since she can't show her face. Talk to either guard and a few options will be presented, but there are only two real possibilities - make them go away with Axii (requires Delusion level 3; 40) or fight and kill them. Either way, as the square is now safe for Triss, she'll approach and retrieve Keira's body, and the quest will complete after a short dialogue and a cutscene.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/It_Takes_Three_to_Tango,Act_III,"After speaking with Ciri, you are approached by both Triss and Yennefer. You're immediately suspicious, but they seem to be playing coy. They tell you there's little point in them both fighting over you, they want to share you. While they prepare one of the rooms at the Kingfisher Inn for a rendezvous to remember, you're to provide the wine.
Note: Erveluce and Est Est are the only two wines that work. It is very likely that you already have some on you and the objective will auto-complete and not even be given. If you don't, either can be purchased from Olivier at the Kingfisher, but as he might have died, the innkeep at Dandelion's establishment, Madame at Crippled Kate's and Marquise Serenity at the Passiflora sell both as well.
With the wine in hand, head for the second floor at the Kingfisher Inn and knock on the first door there to trigger a cutscene. You're greeted by Yennefer in some naughty night attire. She purrs and coos while Triss (also dressed in next to nothing) extracts the wine from your hands. You're pushed onto the bed. Triss and Yennefer lightly stroking you. Hold on, what's this? Manacles? Well, if it pleases the ladies...
Triss and Yennefer open the wine. You inquire about getting yours. They reply that you're about to get what you deserve. And, with a wry smile and a cute smirk, Triss and Yennefer leave you chained to the bed, leaving you to ponder on how you should treat powerful sorceresses in the future.
Dandelion discovers you next morning. Feel free to try some idle threats during your chat, during which he says you've a lot to learn about the fairer sex. After being freed, and if Through Time and Space has not yet been completed, you decide to pay a visit to Avallac'h.[1]
Note: Geralt will be disrobed at the end of the subquest and will need to get dressed again.","Bring some good wine to your rendezvous with Triss and Yennefer.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Preparations,Act_III,"The quest starts while you're still at Novigrad, but there's nothing to do there except talk to Avallac'h to tell him that you can set sail to Skellige. Note: this may be your last opportunity to play gwent with Madman Lugos. See Gwent: Skellige Style for more info.
When you arrive at Kaer Trolde Harbor, the first two subquests will start and you just have to go through them. Doing so is quite straightforward, with the only notable thing being that Child of the Elder Blood starts after the first portion of The Sunstone, and then Skjall's Grave is optionally started through a choice at the end of Child of the Elder Blood.
After arriving at the harbor and following the introductory cutscenes, Yennifer and Triss will both have a number of dialogue options (some newly added), and Geralt can also speak to Avallac'h and get a better sense of the elf's relationship to Ciri. Ciri, herself, has no additional dialogue options. Geralt can also enter the cabin of the craft and speak to Philippa Eilhart; Margarita Laux-Antille will be there initiallly but will move to the poop deck before she can be spoken to, but Geralt can converse with her there.
When you're all done, make sure that you're not forgetting Reason of State before telling Avallac'h that everything is ready. In doing so, your ship will sail to Undvik, though you'll have the option to stay behind and meet the others there later.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sunstone,Act_III,"You'll first need to find Ermion and ask him for a lead on where to look for the Sunstone. However, this plays out differently depending on who became the ruler of Skellige.
An Craite ruler[]
If either Cerys or Hjalmar became the ruler, then you'll first need to ask Crach where to find Ermion. The jarl will be nearby, so it's convenient do that immediately even if you plan to do another quest first. When talked to, he will tell you that the druid went to speak with Madman Lugos.
Note: As of Patch 4.0, the talk with Crach is the cutoff point for playing gwent with Madman Lugos for Gwent: Skellige Style.
Head to Kaer Muire where you'll find Ermion and Lugos arguing. Geralt will interject and, regardless of your dialogue choice, the Madman lives up to his moniker and orders an attack. You'll will have to kill him and around 10 of his warriors; Ermion will help, but is mostly a distraction. When the fighting is over, follow Ermion a long way down the road, through Holmstein and then some distance north before you can actually speak to him. Note: After the fight, you can also search the courtyard for the usual random loot and weapons. Ermion will travel on his own down the hill, fighting and defeating Lugos' many of Lugos' guards. As result, you can also stay back and loot the castle approach area (though be careful as some of Lugos' men may survive Ermion's onslaught). Once you've had your fill of Kaer Muire, Ermion will be waiting north of Holmstein.
Svanrige king[]
If Svanrige Tuirseach became king, Ermion will be at the Kaer Trolde citadel. As you approach the hall there, you'll encounter a furious Donar who will tell Geralt about Birna Bran's scheme to make a deal with Nilfgaard, after which you find her, Svanrige and all the jarls around a table with a Nilfgaardian emissary.
Svanrige defies his mother and kills the emissary, starting a battle with the Nilfgaardian soldiers around, who you now must help defeat. When the fight is over, Ermion will speak to you.
Eyvind and the pearl divers[]
Ermion doesn't know where the sunstone is, but directs you to two parties interested in elven legends - a skald named Eyvind and some shady pearl divers known to loot elven treasures. He also suggests that you bring a sorceress with you.
Eyvind will be on a cliff west of Arinbjorn, on a lookout for Gevorg, a legendary white whale. There will be two timed dialogue choices while you speak to him. The first is whether to alert him when Gevorg appears, but that one is irrelevant and he'll never see it even if you do. Eyvind will then ask why you want to visit the elven ruins, and you have to avoid mentioning Ermion during any part of the conversation, as he doesn't want you to defile still preserved elven sites and will refuse to help. If this happens, you will have no choice but to find the pearl divers.
Note: If you wish to complete all objectives, you can just mention Ermion to Eyvind, causing him to refuse help (still marks as green) and then move on to the pearl divers.
The pearl divers are in an underwater cavern on the eastern shore near the road to Eldberg Lighthouse. If you're having trouble finding them, you have to find an entrance under the water where their boat is. They will just give you the information you need. Once the conversation is over, you will be attacked by a few drowners, though you can just run away from them.
Regardless of how, you'll be directed to the Ancient Crypt and it's time to go see Yennefer. She'll be talking to Philippa and Ciri, who wants to visit Avallac'h's lab instead. Philippa will take the initiative to help Geralt with the Sunstone, so Yen can go with Ciri. After the conversation, the Child of the Elder Blood quest starts and you can do that first if you wish.
The Ancient Crypt[]
If you already have the Ancient Crypt your map you can just fast travel there; it has both harbor and signpost markers. If not, you'll need to take a boat; the closest (default) one can be found at Kaer Trolde, ironically not far from where Philippa departed. Philippa will be waiting by the entrance and will open it once you approach. Proceed with the search and follow the sorceress. Along the way you can take a small detour where a wraith will spawn, but either way soon you will encounter a Siren and some drowners protecting her. After taking care of them you can use the Igni Place of power nearby.
Just a bit ahead you will find a ruined staircase, which Philippa will promptly fix. The path will split here and if you go left you will encounter a Venomous arachas guarding a few worthwhile chests, as well as a hidden treasure with spikes coming out of the floor. You can use Witcher Senses to see where the spikes are to pass safely, and/or you can use Quen for extra protection and try to jump over. Casting Aard or Igni will cause to the spikes to briefly extend, allowing you to see a safe path. Once you are on the other side pull the lever to turn them off, then go back to Philippa when you are done.
The right path will take you to a Golem and when it's dead, you can get a Naevde Seidhe in the side room here. A bit further ahead Philippa will talk to Geralt about Yennefer and Ciri. There's another detour nearby with some Wild Hunt warrior ghosts guarding small treasures behind a door. On the way to the ghosts there is a chest to the left hidden behind some breakable pillars. Eventually you will reach the room where the Sunstone is and you have to solve a puzzle before it is revealed.
The mirrors puzzle[]
The goal is to achieve a single beam of light through mirror reflections. The light starts from the central crystal, is reflected to each mirror, and ends near a secret door on the platform where Philippa will now be standing. The easiest way to do this is to trace the beam of light from the central crystal to the first mirror it reflects off of. It is the only mirror to have multiple beams being reflected, on the right side. Once at this mirror, pull the lever to rotate it so the beam now reflects only to the mirror on it's right. Proceed from there and you should only have to rotate the other two mirrors once, though they are guarded by a ghost each.
When you're done, the the beam goes in the direction of where Philippa is standing, causing the The Sunstone to appear. After making your way over to Philippa, a cutscene will trigger in which she continues her political schemes, though the dialog differs slightly depending on your choices for romance. Philippa then gives Geralt the Sunstone and flies away as an owl, ending the quest. (500)
However, you still need to exit the ruins. You can go back the way you came, but there are more treasures ahead using the secret door that is now open. There are also some chests among the ruins where the puzzle was. If you continue ahead, you'll have to fight a few more ghosts and will exit through an illusion north of Rogne.
Note: This entrance corresponds with a marked Monster Den. If you explored the Rogne area previously, the ""bonus"" section of the ruins may have already been cleared out of monsters and treasure.","Unless Svanrige is king of Skellige:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Veni_Vidi_Vigo,Act_III,"Geralt must speak to Emhyr about freeing Fringilla Vigo, so that she can aid him in his upcoming battle with the Wild Hunt. Emhyr is aboard his flagship, surrounded by his fleet near Undvik. Your goal is to reach the anchor of the flagship and climb aboard. To do so, you must swim to the flagship during night while avoiding the fleet's spotlights.
A good idea is to fast travel to Marlin Coast and walk by the coast to a spot near the fleet. When ready, imbibe a Killer Whale and just swim deep underwater until you reach the flagship, then rise to the surface next to the anchor on the northern side of the ship. If you are discovered before reaching the flagship, the Nilfgaardian soldiers will become hostile and shoot you, although it's possible to survive this and dive down until they lose you. Once you reach the flagship's anchor, a soldier will recognize you and allow you to board. Interacting with the anchor will start a cutscene.
Important: There are two anchors, but only the starboard one - the fully submerged one on the northern side - is functional, both to make the watcher recognize you and to interact with.
During the cutscene, you'll have a few irrelevant dialogue choices, but Geralt delivers Yennefer's letter to Emhyr asking to release Fringilla and he does so. She then teleports Geralt back to Kaer Trolde Harbor and the quest completes.",Sneak onto the emperor's flagship under cover of darkness.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Child_of_the_Elder_Blood,Act_III,"Go to The Pali Gap Coast and enter the cave entrance there. If you don't already have it, the signpost will be conveniently unlocked when the quest starts. When you talk to her or Ciri, Yennefer will attempt to unlock the entrance which will awaken one of the two golems standing guard. After it's dead Yennefer will finish opening the door and you may enter.
As you start to explore, a cutscene will trigger and you'll be commenting on some sketches of Ciri before you're able to do anything else. You can examine a few things, but nothing important is missable. There are only four things of note in the first room:
A pile of cookies on the table to the right of the table with the sketches of Ciri/Lara. Geralt will remark on them, but their discovery won't affect anything.
A note called Caranthir's Progress can be found in the small bookshelf next to the entrance doorway. Note: Prior to Patch 4.0, the item is invisible and doesn't glow while using witcher senses. Instead, the option to loot the bookshelf should appear when you are standing directly next to it.
Yennefer will draw your attention to a table with some distillates and herbs, indicating that someone was just there. Note that this option will disappear if Geralt continues down the stairs into the next room and triggers the cutscene mentioned below.
Fourth is a hairbrush on a table in the hallway leading to the next room. Like the cookies, finding it will not affect anything.
Entering the next room starts a cutscene in which Geralt, Ciri, and Yen examine Lara Dorren's complete genealogy and Avallac'h's notes. After the cutscene, you may loot Remarks Concerning the Death of Auberon from the right side of the long table underneath Lara's genealogy. Note: Prior to Patch 4.0, the document is invisible and isn't revealed by witcher senses, but still lootable if Geralt stands in front of it.
There is a mirror and a container of perfume that can be examined, but they aren't necessary.
After that you will reach a door and Yennefer will remark that someone is on the other side. Enter to find a female Aen Elle, who will insult Ciri and claim that Avallac'h secretly hates her (while at the same time displaying undisguised jealousy towards Ciri and Avallac'h's relationship). When you leave the elf's room, there will be a timed dialogue option with Ciri:
Calm down.
Go for it.
Important: This decision will count towards deciding Ciri's fate at the end of the game. The first option contributes towards a negative ending, while the second contributes towards a positive ending.
If you pick the latter Geralt and Ciri will wreck the place, allowing her to blow off the steam (with a little subtle support by Yennifer). If you told her to calm down, as it usually happens, this doesn't work and Geralt will find and put on her a necklace that belonged to Lara Dorren. Either way, Ciri and Yennifer will leave the room afterwards and you can go back to the room you found the Aen Elle woman in and loot the book Tales and Legends About Humans.
Ciri will go outside and you have to go talk to her, but note that the next cutscene only triggers if you walk past her and it can be confusing if you try to interact with her instead. You will then talk about Skjall and you will have another timed dialogue choice when Ciri ask you to go visit his grave on Hindarsfjall:
Yeah. I'll go with you.
No time.
Important: This decision also counts towards deciding Ciri's fate at the end of the game. The first option contributes towards a positive ending, while the second contributes towards a negative ending.
Choosing to go with Ciri will start Skjall's Grave and you can choose to go immediately or meet her there later, but that quest is practically just one big cutscene, so it's usually better to just save some time and go. If you refuse to go with her, Ciri will be very upset and Geralt can only watch her as he realizes his mistake.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Skjall%27s_Grave,Act_III,"This quest only consists of dialogue options, which don't really change anything regardless of which are chosen. Ciri and Geralt will search for Skjall's grave, but won't find it, as it turns out his body was thrown into a pit where dead sheep are thrown in for crabs to devour. Ciri will pull out his body and give him a proper burial, however some locals will not be happy about that. You can choose to threaten them, but they will not do anything either way, as desecrating graves is, by their laws, the one thing worse than running away from battle. After you leave you will have the option to go back with Ciri or tell her you have to tend to something. The quest then ends.",Meet Ciri in the Hindarsfjall cemetery.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/On_Thin_Ice,Act_III,"When you reach your destination, which is a Nilfgaardian camp set on Marlin Coast, Avallac'h will be explaining his plan to everyone. However, he's not allowing Ciri to take part in the battle, regardless of your dialogue choices. After everything is explained he will tell Geralt to prepare his potions and everything before they start - good idea so do just that while you have the chance.
Note: If you romanced either Triss or Yennefer, Geralt will have one more conversation with the one he chose before you head out. You can also find Ciri training her abilities on the path south of Marlin Coast, and Geralt will exchange a couple of related passive comments with her.
At the start of this quest, Marlin Coast will be a busy Nilfgaardian army encampment. If you need repairs you can get them from the Nilfgaardian quartermaster nearby, who also serves as a Journeyman blacksmith. There will be some alchemy ingredients and weapons in the buildings, safer to get than the containers outside, which the soldiers will attack you for looting, as the game considers it stealing. The immediate area is also cleared out of randomly spawning monsters. Note that the services and gear at the camp are only available until triggering the battle; if Geralt returns to Marlin Coast afterwards, the camp will be gone and the village again deserted.
Note: Be sure to not accidentally steal anything in this area, as the vast amount of Nilfgaardian soldiers will attack you. This does not result in a fail condition, but results in a weird outcome where swarms of Nifgaardian soldiers begin attacking you. If you do end up stealing something, you can try to flee the area and come back, and the soldiers will not attack you on return.
You're still free to travel and acquire better gear, ingredients for new potions or even complete some side quests. The point of no return is speaking to Avallac'h next to the boat.
The Battle Begins[]
Once you are ready, talk to Avallac'h to let the battle begin. Avallac'h and Ciri will use the Sunstone, calling the Naglfar to Undvik. However, Caranthir will freeze everyone and Ciri will head out to save them. You will now be controlling Ciri, who will unleash her Elder Blood power. She will activate a magic aura and begin working through several groups of Wild Hunt enemies, where she can literally one-shot all of them. If you use her Blink ability, she will wipe out up to 5 enemies within range. You can have fun killing the enemies, but they spawn infinitely and you only have to move forward.
Once you reach Caranthir, you will have a short battle. It looks like you have to kill him, but that's not the case. After taking him down by a third of his HP, a cutscene will trigger and Ciri will break the orb on his staff. The explosion will incapacitate her, but she manages to escape. Fortunately, Geralt will thaw out just in time to continue the fight.
The Last General[]
Caranthir will pelt Geralt with magic projectiles and teleport away from him at regular intervals. He will also call Ice Elementals to join the fight. You merely have to avoid them, but if you start getting overwhelmed, keep your distance from Caranthir and position yourself so the Elementals block his line of sight, as his attacks will harm them too, if hit. Quen and Yrden combined with the Magic Trap ability can be effective for blocking his attacks. Do not worry about saving potions and bombs for fighting Eredin, as you can meditate without any time lapse immediately after this fight. Once Caranthir is near 5% HP, a cutscene will trigger. Geralt will pierce his sword completely through Caranthir. However, Caranthir will then teleport them both deep underwater in a last attempt to kill Geralt. The cutscene ends and you will now have to the surface as quickly as possible. This is fairly easy to do, but Killer Whale can also help ensure you have enough time.
Reaching Eredin[]
Now meditate if you need to and move forward. Just like with Ciri, enemies through most of the path will spawn infinitely, so just clear your path toward the Naglfar if necessary. Along the way you will encounter Udalryk and then Hjalmar, who Geralt will ask if they've seen Ciri. However, this is not the time to talk so just keep pushing forward. When you reach the Naglfar, another cutscene will trigger where Eredin will be fighting Crach an Craite. The jarl is badly injured and Eredin is merely toying with him by giving him back his axe to continue the fight. Crach lunges at him one last time, but Eredin cuts him down with one final blow. Geralt approaches and Eredin says he's got something to tell him, but will wait to do so until after they fight.
The King of The Wild Hunt[]
Eredin has no one to lean on anymore, however don't count him out just yet and use everything you have to put him down. When the fight starts, he will taunt Geralt to show him his famous pirouette. Like other Aen Elle, he will quickly teleport from one spot to another, similar to the previous fight against Caranthir. From a distance, Eredin will attack with magic, but will use his sword while in melee range.
He is relatively easy to stagger and using using the Quen Exploding Shield ability can help with this. Using the Whirl combat ability can be effective if used methodically and activated at the right time, but Eredin is very good at parrying and will block every strike if you use it at the wrong time. Using Rend constantly without charging it will allow constant strikes against Eredin that can't be countered, only parried, and due to the ability this will end him quite quickly. If you don't have Rend though, be patient and wait for him to use his ranged attacks, as he is static and vulnerable then.
After landing a few blows, he will throw Geralt through a portal and they will continue their fight on an icy plateau. Once Eredin is almost beaten, he will open a portal back to the Naglfar. Large magic projectiles will begin falling from the sky, so make your way to the portal as quickly as possible, follow him through and finish the fight. Once he is down to almost 0 HP, a cutscene will trigger where their swords clash and the force of Eredin's strike will knock Geralt back. However, Geralt uses the momentum to perform a pirouette (the irony is strong) and direct his sword to Eredin's face, plucking his eye out. After one last exchange, Geralt will slash his midsection and Eredin falls to the ground. Geralt asks what he wanted to tell him, and Eredin says that they were both fooled by Avallac'h, who supposedly set them against one another so he could make off with Ciri. Eredin then dies and hounds of the Wild Hunt will begin closing in. Yennefer will then appear and pulls Geralt away through a portal to save him.
You'll receive 500, Hav'caaren and a Lesser Glyph of Aard as the quest ends and Tedd Deireadh, The Final Age begins.","Join Avallac'h and the sorceresses on Undvik.

"https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Tedd_Deireadh,_The_Final_Age",Act_III,"All hell breaks loose and it seems Eredin wasn't lying about Avallac'h. Apparently a new Conjunction of the Spheres has started, and after a short conversation, Geralt will be following Yennefer to hunt down Avallac'h. You will have to run a while, so now is the perfect time to drink a Werewolf decoction (don't worry about meditating if the previous fight left you with low health as Geralt will be automatically given a full health bar) will be As you approach the Ice Giant's Ship, fire starts raining down while you run forward, so you should try to avoid it.
You will soon reach some horses that you will use for the next leg of the trek. Using a Nekker warrior decoction here will help keep your horse from spooking and knocking you off, as monsters will be spawning everywhere. Unfortunately, even without the monsters spooking your horse, Yennefer's movement on horseback is erratic and she takes multiple sharp turns impossible for the player, often driving you right into danger. Thus, you may find it easier to just follow her on foot and ignore her remarks about you lagging behind - nothing will fail. In fact, you're even free to loot and fight the monsters if you wish.
Shortly after passing the Abandoned Village, you'll leave the horses and continue on foot towards Tor Gvalch'ca. On the way, Yen will create a shield to protect you from the White Frost and a couple of Wild Hunt hounds will have to be disposed of too (but Geralt will take damage if he gets too far away from Yen). When you get close to the tower there will be a barrier preventing you from entering, but Yen will be able to make a hole in it for Geralt to get through it. At this point you just have to walk ahead and the rest is dialogues and cutscenes (unusually there is no mission waypoint to follow, but the pathway up to the tower should be easy to spot).
When you reach Avallac'h, he throws down his sword after Geralt challenges him. As it turns out, he did not betray Geralt and all of this was Ciri's idea, as she intends to face the White Frost. Now you will have several dialogue options, however no matter what you say she will go anyway so it's probably best to wish her good luck.
When Ciri enters the gate, she'll have a flashback of key decisions that you've made throughout the game, determining her fate. If at least half of your decisions were positive, her story ending may still vary depending on other factors, but you will get a positive ending. If you've made more negative decisions, obviously the opposite happens and Geralt later outright says that she died, although suggestions that she simply doesn't return to him exist.
1,000 is awarded as this quest completes, and the ending is revealed in the next one - Something Ends, Something Begins.","Follow Yennefer.
Get to the elven tower."
"https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Something_Ends,_Something_Begins_(quest)",Act_III,"Geralt returns to the Royal Palace for an audience with Emhyr and you have to follow Mererid to the Emperor's office. When you meet him, Emhyr asks Geralt to report, and the witcher calmly explains that Ciri died in the process of defeating the White Frost, and her body is likely never to be found. A couple of dialogue options of no importance are available and then the audience ends. (150)
You then arrive at White Orchard and start by talking to some civilians about the end of the war, after which your objective is to go to the former Nilfgaardian Garrison, so hop on Roach and do just that. However, you may wish to stop at the Sawmill signpost.
If Radovid won the war
You can take a detour towards Tomira's hut to find her crying for mercy at the hands of witch hunters, just about to burn her on a stake. You have the option to intervene and save her (you have to untie her, not put out the fire), though it's still quite sad even when you do and there are no rewards for this.
As you arrive at your destination, a cutscene starts and evidently the person Geralt has to meet is late, so he meditate while waiting. Eventually, Master Ort arrives and presents Geralt with what he claims is the best silver sword ever made. You have choice an inscription put on the sword, and one of them matches its name: Zireael. The swordsmith then leaves and you have to go to the village inn. (Before leaving the garrison, note this is the first time you will be able to freely explore and loot the place without agitating guards. Most of the containers have the usual mundane crafting loot, but glyths and orens may also be found.)
It's obviously easier to fast travel there, but if you instead take the eastern fork of the road, then around halfway between a guarded treasure and hidden treasure, you will encounter a cutscene with one of the dwarves that you saw on The Isle of Mists. He runs away as he sees Geralt and you can chase him to find his and his mates' camp nearby, where Geralt will call out for them to come out of the bushes. After exchanging a few words, soldiers or witch hunters (depending on who won the war) come looking for them and the dwarves hide. You can cover for them, threaten and fight the enemies, or surrender them. Unless you choose the latter, you'll have the option to ask for a coin reward, yielding 250 .
Geralt's gift to Ciri
When you enter the inn, another cutscene starts and Geralt approaches a hooded woman who turns out to be Ciri, alive and well. She asks if her father believed that she was dead, but Geralt has no idea. He then gives her the new silver sword from Master Ort, officially making Ciri a witcheress and completing the quest.","Follow the chamberlain. (150)

Empress Ending[]
This ending requires the greatest amount of conditions to be met. 3 or more positive points need to be earned here and during Blood on the Battlefield the player must bring Ciri to meet Emhyr.
On top of that, Nilfgaard must win the war, meaning the Assassins' Quests need to be completed and the player must be diplomatic with Dijkstra during Blindingly Obvious to unlock Reason of State. Then, during this quest, one must side with the Temerian patriots to ensure Nilfgaard wins the war."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Pearl_(quest),Multiple_Regions,"You may find the notice for this quest on Hierarch Square's notice board, but it's not necessary and you may also directly go to The Golden Sturgeon to meet Nidas.
He tells you how he wishes to go back to Skellige to find a black pearl to bring back to his wife, but needs help as he's not as fit as he used to be. If you agree, he'll then ask you to meet him north of Arinbjorn. Bug: If you don't talk to Nidas when the quest marker first appears, the quest may become unavailable later. So if you wish to complete it it's best to pick up the quest as soon as you have the chance, after that it doesn't matter how long it takes before you start doing it.
Once you arrive in Skellige, travel to the marker to find him waiting on the broken bridge for you. He'll talk for a bit before leading you a short distance to the waters where he explains he needs you to do the heavy lifting.
Head out into the waters where you'll find a number of shells but also a couple sirens. The shell you want is naturally the farthest from shore and, once you got the black pearl, head back. As you get closer, you'll see Nidas come under attack by drowners so hurry to him and kill them off, then talk to him once more. Note: Nidas can die here if you don't help him in time which will cause the quest to fail. Eventually he'll tell you he forgot to bring his purse with him, but regardless what you say, he promises to pay you back in Novigrad before leaving (25 ).
Head back to The Golden Sturgeon to meet Nidas once again and talk with him. No matter your choice, he reveals the full story: his wife, Letta, is sick and suffering from the equivalent of Alzheimer's in that she can't remember or recognize people anymore and Nidas was hoping the black pearl would help but sadly it didn't.

The other 79 cards are duplicates (for example, there are three Ghoul cards you can find, but you only need one for this quest objective).[1]
Northern Realms Gwent deck (40 cards)
Nilfgaardian Empire Gwent deck (41 cards)
Monsters Gwent deck (44 cards)
Scoia'tael Gwent deck (41 cards)
Gwent neutral cards (29 cards)
Gwent cards may be obtained by purchasing them from merchants, winning against others at gwent, and by winning against named NPCs in gwent-related secondary quests. After winning against a certain number of generic merchants, playing against merchants will no longer earn new cards. The book A Miraculous Guide to Gwent (added by Patch 1.20) can be used to keep track of the number of cards still necessary to obtain from each region, and of ones acquired from gwent secondary quests.
Missable cards[]
Throughout the game, some cards are easily missed if a player chooses one action over another, chooses to skip a side quest, or just by not exploring. Here's a list of such cases:
Do the side quest A Matter of Life and Death: There'll be a small gwent tournament going on in the main courtyard where you'll need to win all the rounds to get all the cards.
Do A Deadly Plot: Turns out the one you're looking for is a big gwent player and has one of the best cards in the game.
Do A Dangerous Game and take the cards as your reward.
Participate in High Stakes: You must win the tournament to get every card (see main quest page for tips).
Do Shock Therapy to get the Iorveth card.
Free the Claywich merchant who is held captive southeast of the Boatmakers' Hut: Be careful as this merchant is bugged. Make a save just before opening his cage, then fast travel to Claywich. If the talking option doesn't show up, reload until it does or meditate until daylight. Make sure to buy all the gwent cards he has for sale.
Play Lambert as soon as you can (either at The Nowhere Inn or at Kaer Morhen when the witchers are drinking)
See this list for a breakdown in missable characters/cards, making sure to play (or buy from) each one as soon as you can to avoid missing their card later. Patch 1.05 added in fail-safes if you missed a player's card.",Complete your collection of gwent cards.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Following_the_Thread_(The_Witcher_3),Multiple_Regions,"This quest can be started by finding the notice Contract: Monster in the Bits on Hierarch Square's notice board. With it, go talk to the supervisor, and it turns out that some ""brave fool"" is already after the beast. However, you'll still learn the location of the incident and can investigate.
After examining the crime scene, follow the track of claw marks until you reach the river, here you have to swim to the other side, were you'll find the rest of the tracks. Upon entering the building you'll find Lambert fighting an ekimmara. After the fight you have a short chat with him and at the end you'll have the option to immediately collect the reward together or meet up later. Choosing the latter is better, so you can loot an ekimmara hide from the vampire's remains.
Either way, when you go to collect the reward with Lambert, he starts a fight and goes after the supervisor, leaving you behind to deal with three guards. When done with them, head inside the building, where no matter what Lambert will finish off the supervisor and ask you to join him at the Seven Cats. Important: This is the cutoff point for Flesh for Sale. After the next talk with Lambert starts, that quest will no longer be available.
When you talk to him next, Lambert will explain that he's after an assassin named Jad Karadin in order to avenge for Aiden, his witcher friend from the School of the Cat, who Jad and his gang murdered. One of the gang members, Vienne, frequents the inn, so that's why you're here and you head inside.
When you talk to her, she will claim she doesn't know where Jad Karadin is. However, she will provide you with the information of the other two members, Selyse and Hammond. A fight may or may not break out depending on which conversational option is chosen at the end. Choosing the option ""Do what you think is right"" will cause Vienne to call for help and combat with Vienne and three other elfs will start, while the other option is peaceful. In either case, Lambert will suggest splitting up, and Geralt will have to search for Hammond on Faroe. Note: Prior to finding Hammond, you may optionally speak with Crach to learn what he knows about Hammond.
Go to Faroe and speak to the pirates at the entrance of Trottheim. Note: If you have already completed Flesh for Sale, do not fast-travel to Trottheim, because you will be transported to the middle of the village, and the conversation with the pirates will not trigger. As they've met Geralt before, they'll turn hostile in this case anyway, but it's also possible that even with an outside approach they don't drop Orders from Hammond, which is supposed to reveal his location.
Regardless of how they're dealt with, Hammond can be found at a shrine near the easternmost end of the island, although the location marker may be wrong if you have completed Flesh for Sale. After a brief dialogue with Hammond, he and his men will attack you. Once all of them are killed, searching his body will give you a letter from Jad Karadin.
Note: Prior to Patch 4.01, while Crach states that he will offer a reward for killing Hammond, upon completing this task and returning to him, there are no additional dialogue options to receive the reward. However, with the patch, Crach now has a dialogue option to receive the promised reward, earning 50  and 200 .
Return to Novigrad and meet Lambert at The Nowhere Inn. Lambert will tell you that Karadin is now living as a successful merchant and trader in Novigrad under an alias. Geralt and Lambert will decide to visit Karadin at his home. As the duo approaches Karadin's residence, guards approach them and take them to Karadin, who turns out to be a retired witcher. Geralt converses with Karadin, who says that his band was forced to kill Aiden when he turned on them. You can choose either to spare Karadin or help kill him. Lambert will be angry with Geralt if you insist on leaving Karadin, but there will be no consequences beyond the dialogue of this quest. Regardless of the choice, the two will go on their separate ways as the quest ends.

Read the journal to start the quest, then examine the body and the zebra crest on the nearby wrecked ship to conclude they're not from the Northern Realms nor Nilfgaard.
Head to the southern part of the island to see a mostly sunken ship mast and dive down to find a chest containing a letter sealed with impermeable wax and the captain's log. You can read the letter but it's in another language. However, the log gives more insight into things and points to your next location: Ursten, a small village south of Novigrad.
Head to Ursten where what you do next will cause a slight difference in conversations. If you talk with the warrior in town, you won't be able to talk to the woman later, though you can still decide the outcome (you just won't be able to give her the documents).

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Gwent:_Old_Pals,Multiple_Regions,"This quest is started by challenging and defeating Zoltan at gwent, and the earliest and easiest opportunity to do that is during the Broken Flowers main quest, when Geralt first meets him.
Zoltan[]
Note: Getting Zoltan to play a game is not so easy as his dialogues change depending on where you are with the main quest.
There are only two occasions to play him during Broken Flowers. 1st is after reporting back to him after talking to all the girls, simply talk to him again and he will be available for a round. 2nd is after talking to Priscilla at the end of the quest, simply talk to him while he is leaving. If you fail on both occasions, you will have to wait until you complete A Poet Under Pressure whereupon he will also give you the quest A Dangerous Game.
Once beaten he'll give 25  and the Eithné card, and will direct Geralt to play Vernon Roche, who's hiding out at the Temerian Partisan Hideout.
Roche[]
If you haven't already met Roche, head out and after a small conversation with one of his men, Roche will appear and will be available to play. Once he's beaten he'll give 25  and the Saesenthessis card. If you haven't already played Lambert, he'll then direct you to play your fellow witcher, though depending on where you are in various quests, you'll have to wait a bit on this. He'll also hint at another player, but won't drop his name if you haven't completed A Deadly Plot.
Lambert[]
The quickest way outside the main storyline to play Lambert is by doing the secondary quest Following the Thread and continue the quest until you're given the objective to meet him at The Nowhere Inn. When you meet him there, when given the chance to say ""Let's go"" or ""I'll meet you there"" pick the latter and Lambert will begin to walk away. Talk to him as quickly as possible (if he moves too far away from you he'll disappear to the next quest location) and challenge him to a game of gwent. However, you can also play with Lambert right after completing the quest, just talk to him as he is walking away and he will be available for a match. Alternatively you can follow him back to The Nowhere Inn and challenge him there, but don't leave him out of your sight or he will disappear.
Note: As of Patch 4.0, Lambert will also first stick around the Seven Cats Inn until Geralt leaves its vicinity after the encounter with Vienne, and later he will also go to the Nowhere Inn after completing Following the Thread, and remain there until Uma is retrieved during Ugly Baby, giving lots of time to play with him.
If you failed to challenge Lambert in Novigrad, continue the main storyline as normal and you'll eventually be able to challenge him again at Kaer Morhen. Beating him at either location gives another 25  and the Triss Merigold card. If you're having trouble getting a non-quest conversation with him, don't worry - simply playing gwent during No Place Like Home counts toward this quest (even though you're technically playing Eskel), but in any case you will be able to challenge him before starting The Isle of Mists and the quest will update to remind you too.
There's one last opportunity to play him even after The Battle of Kaer Morhen, provided that he survives it - during Blood on the Battlefield, he is the sole person at the funeral who can be talked to with non-scripted dialogue, after his initial response, allowing to challenge him to a match.
Thaler[]
Note: This part is only available if A Deadly Plot has been completed prior to playing with Roche. If it was not, then Thaler is excluded from this quest and will have his own (Gwent: Playing Thaler) once A Deadly Plot is completed.
After beating Roche he will direct you to Thaler (and Lambert of course) who now spends his time at the Seven Cats Inn. However, he cannot be played during Reason of State and he can also die during that quest, so it's best to play him before that. Once you beat him you will earn 25 and the powerful Geralt of Rivia card.
Failsafe conditions[]
Despite plenty of time to complete this quest beforehand, it is entirely possible that it isn't even started for the duration of the entire main story and, as Lambert becomes unavailable, and Roche and Thaler can die during Reason of State, that creates a lot of possible branches.
Particularly if Roche dies before he is beaten at gwent, an objective will be added to look for his card at the Temerian Partisan Hideout. What you'll actually find there are Roche's notes, with the card attached to them and the notes themselves directing Geralt to Lambert and Thaler. Of course, neither can be played anymore either, but an objective will be created to find Lambert's card at Kaer Morhen keep. After an unknown patch, another one to find Thaler's card at the Seven Cats Inn is added as well, but the card could be found there even without the objective (use Witcher Senses to find it easier).
The difference if Roche was defeated before he dies is small - you simply won't have to look for his notes, with the rest playing out the same, all the possible conditions attached; i.e. Thaler may not be part of the quest, but his card is still lootable.
You will get red marks for winning matches, but  is still awarded and the quest is allowed to complete. Bug: Thaler's objective, if you have it, is bugged in multiple ways - it doesn't show a marker on the world map, doesn't award , nor does it resolve itself, leaving the quest stuck even after the card is obtained. There's no known workaround for this and so this scenario should be avoided (his standalone gwent quest is fine).","Win a unique card from Zoltan.
Win a unique card from Vernon Roche.
If Roche dies during Reason of State and hasn't been defeated yet:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Master_Armorers,Multiple_Regions,"When Geralt is speaking to Fergus Graem, he can ask about mastercrafted armor. When he does, Yoana - who works the forge with Fergus - tells of the tools of Clan Tordarroch which could be used to create a light and strong armor.
Note: You can also be directed to Fergus by first speaking to the armourer at Hierarch Square and/or at Kaer Trolde keep. Which won't change much but will grant an additional journal entry. However, since you will likely meet Fergus before either of them, then you should not ask him about crafting master tier armour before talking to either of them if you want to get the additional entry.
Geralt is then tasked with retrieving tools from the Clan Tordarroch Forge on Undvik island in Skellige. You will most likely come across it during The Lord of Undvik, unless you take some detour. The forge will be guarded by an Ice Troll, which is a higher level than the rest on the island. Kill it and take the high-quality smithing tools and Deithwen from the nearby chest. Now bring the tools to Fergus, and soon Harmon aep Groenekan will appear and ask Fergus to forge an armor for him too. While negotiating Yoana will reveal that she is the true master armorer and say she is fed up with her status as a ""helper"". She will ask Geralt to bring her acid to forge an excellent armor, to which he will remark that kikimores and archgriffins spit acid, Yoana will say that an Archgriffin was spotted nearby. This unlocks Contract: The Griffin from the Highlands which will appear on the notice board.
Upon completion of this contract bring Yoana the archgriffin acid gland and she will forge her armor. Harmon will appear and ask what is going on? After explaining who the true master is he will demand both armors to be put to the test and Geralt will have to wear the one forged by Yoana. If you inquire how the test will be performed he will say that both will be shot with bolts. If you refuse the quest will fail and Yoana will leave Crow's Perch for good. If you agree the test will be performed and obviously Yoana's armor will be the victor. Harmon will declare that the forge now belongs to Yoana and pay her for the armor, Fergus will decide to leave but Yoana will tell him he can stay only without the charade to which he will agree.
A Diagram: Mag Deira cuirass is awarded here, and after a day Yoana will create a unique armor for Geralt, and be available to create mastercrafted armors if Geralt has diagrams for them. After you return to claim your reward the quest ends.","Ask if Fergus is a master armorer.

On the road between Arinbjorn and Sund, you'll find a child calling for help. If you talk to them, the boy will tell you his father was attacked by a bear while cutting wood. He'll then walk to the side of the road and runs off as a group of thugs come out to ambush you. Like in Novigrad, the child is nowhere to be seen afterwards.

Speaking to her reveals her frying pan was stolen by a man who had barricaded himself inside the hut, with a different man entering the hut but never leaving, and she wants your help to get it back.
Break down the locked door using Aard to find a couple of containers with some loot in the first room. In the second room you'll find a corpse, which explains the stench the old woman complained about. Finding the corpse will also trigger a new objective to find out what happened.

Note: If you are quick enough you can actually hop on the horse, who you will be unable to control except for making it run faster, which doesn't change anything but makes the chase easier. However, since the distance is so short anyway, this doesn't make any practical difference.
You can inquire the soldier about his exploits during the war. He will reveal the horse's name is Gulden and that he left the horse with his friend Mirko (the peasant from the start). The soldier will reward Geralt with 15  and then ride Gulden back into the village and the quest ends. (20)

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Missing_in_Action,White_Orchard,"If Geralt discovered this quest via the notice on the notice board in White Orchard he will first have to find Dune. Dune Vildenvert can be found muttering to a dog sitting outside a destroyed hut in the ransacked village. When Geralt speaks to him, Dune explains the search he's undertaken to find his lost brother Bastien and offers a reward if you aid him.
After agreeing to help Dune find his brother, he'll ask Geralt to meet him at the battlefield. Follow him there or meet him whenever is convenient. Once Geralt speaks to Dune at the battlefield he will advise searching the site for Temerian shields with flowers drawn on them, which indicate White Orchard recruits.
Geralt will have to defeat a few ghouls that are prowling the battlefield. Use Witcher Senses to locate the Temerian shields if necessary, although they are rather easy to spot and their blue color makes them stand out. After inspecting the burned corpse of a fallen soldier (near the woods) Hussar will pick up the scent of Bastien.
Follow the dog or use Witcher Senses to follow the dog's trail of prints to an abandoned cabin. As Geralt approaches the cabin a cutscene occurs. Geralt finds a badly wounded Bastien sitting and talking with a wounded Nilfgaardian soldier, Rhosyn. Bastien explains how they helped each other reach this cabin after they were both wounded and demands that Dune help both him and Rhosyn return home. Dune is skeptical about taking in a Nilfgaardian deserter which leaves the decision of Rhosyn's fate to Geralt.
If Geralt says it's too risky for Dune and his family to harbor a deserter, Rhosyn will die in the cabin. If you convince Dune to help the Nilfgaardian because Rhosyn helped save Bastien, then he can be found later living with Dune and his family. Either decision ends the quest and you are rewarded with a bit of coin and XP.
If, however, you found the men at the cabin before speaking to Dune, they'll instead ask you to find Dune. When you do, he will rescue Bastien, but leave Rhosyn to die (as Geralt isn't there to convince Dune otherwise). Even if you should follow Dune all the way to the cabin, he'll simply say thanks, cutting out any option to try and speak up for Rhosyn.","Find Dune Vildenvert.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/On_Death%27s_Bed,White_Orchard,"This quest is given by the herbalist Tomira in White Orchard, if she is asked whether the griffin of White Orchard attacked the injured girl on the bed in her hut. This usually happens during the main quest The Beast of White Orchard, after Geralt is directed to the herbalist by captain Peter Saar Gwynleve.
You must then decide whether to give the witcher potion Swallow to the young peasant woman, Lena, who was indeed mortally injured by the griffin.
You will need to brew one which requires you to find the ingredients and then craft it in your inventory. The recipe calls for:
1 × Dwarven spirit
1 × Drowner brain
5 × Celandine
Getting the ingredients[]
The dwarven spirit can be purchased from the tavern keeper in White Orchard or crafted if you don't want to pay for it. A Dwarven spirit can also spawn in a lootable sack in the western-most corner of the alchemist's garden.
The drowner brain can be looted from the drops of drowners you kill. Search along the river coast for drowners, especially between White Orchard and the Nilfgaardian Garrison or near the Ransacked Village.
Tomira actually sells celandine so it can simply be bought from her, but it also grows in many of the fields surrounding White Orchard, especially between the village center and the herbalist's house. Once you have the alchemy ingredients, simply craft the potion in the alchemy section of your character menu. Alternatively, the quest Precious Cargo can also provide the necessary celandine if you choose to keep the contents of the locked chest.
Take the potion to the herbalist[]
With the potion in your inventory, talk to Tomira and say ""Got a potion for Lena."" to complete the quest, for which she will award Geralt with the formula for cursed oil, the book Of Sweat and Blood, and 2 vials of venom extract. Make sure to read the book, which will unlock several bestiary entries and a couple decoction formulae.","Brew a dose of the Swallow potion.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Precious_Cargo,White_Orchard,"Approach the merchant and inquire about his troubles to learn that his cart and goods have become stuck in a monster infested area of the bog. He requests that Geralt help him retrieve his lost merchandise, specifically a small box that was on the cart. The first step is to find where the cart left the road just a few steps away from the merchant himself. Use Witcher Senses to identify and then examine the cart tracks that lead off into the swamp, then follow them to the missing cart. Prepare to fight a few drowners before checking the cart.
Examine the cart to find that it is riddled with arrows, a big indicator that monsters didn't attack like the merchant said. Further examination of the horse's body (also with arrows) and a corpse nearby all indicate an attack that the merchant conveniently left out.
Nearby is the locked box, which is easy enough to find with Witcher Senses, and just happens to be covered in human blood.
Head back to the merchant, where you have two choices to make: give the box to him without mentioning his lie, or point out the lie. If you simply give him the box, he'll gladly pay Geralt for the help and then be on his way (earning 25  and 20 ).
If, however, you point out that he lied, he will poorly attempt to distract Geralt before escaping on horseback. You must ride after him and attempt to knock him off his horse with either sword, crossbow, or bombs. He's not incredibly hard to catch though as long as you keep up. Note: if you let the bandit get too far away, the quest will fail.
If you manage to knock him off his horse before he reaches the insurgent camp, you won't have to fight any other bandits. However, if you fail to knock him off in time and he reaches the camp, you'll have 3 additional bandits that must be dealt with first.
As long as he didn't escape, once you catch him he'll reveal himself as John Geermer, a private in a disbanded Temerian unit that has been part of a group conducting raids on Nilfgaardian supplies. You then have 3 choices here:
Let him go but you keep the box (10  and 50  and some alchemical ingredients)
Let him go and give him the box (10  and 30 )

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Twisted_Firestarter,White_Orchard,"This quest can be started by reading the notice board in White Orchard or talking to the blacksmith Willis directly. Willis will tell Geralt how someone burned down his forge. If Geralt says that he can find the arsonist, the blacksmith will offer gold and suggest checking for clues behind his house and the quest will begin.
Go behind the house to find the tracks and follow them, eventually leading Geralt down to the river. Follow the river bank north (left) to the other side of the bridge where the trail picks up again. Geralt will learn that the arsonist ran into a drowner and was wounded, at which point four drowners may attack, but only if doing the quest during the night. Once taken care of, continue to follow the trail back to the village and into a house.
Inside, Geralt finds the culprit, Napp, hiding in the back room with an injured hand. Napp will offer a bribe (20) for Geralt to drop the whole thing. If Geralt refuses the bribe, he can either fistfight Napp (losing equals death and save reload) or use Axii (extra 25) before making Napp stagger down to the blacksmith.
If Geralt turns in the arsonist, Willis will call over some soldiers, who will take Napp away, presumably to be hanged, after which he pays you the promised reward, 20 .
Regardless of choices, you get 25 when you talk to Napp (not counting Axii bonus) and then 50 when you return to the blacksmith. The quest then completes and Willis will provide his smithing services.","Use your Witcher Senses to look behind the forge for clues about the arsonist.

Important: Once Geralt remarks on the pack, the dog can die here if you don't interfere fast enough to save it, locking you out of doing the quest. The wolves are also level 9, which can be significant compared to the quest level if doing it early. The dog is pretty strong though and it can actually kill them in one bite, you merely have to keep them occupied so they don't gang up on it.
Save the dog and Geralt will find a key on the dog's collar before it takes off, wanting you to follow it. Note: don't stray too far away here, as the quest will fail otherwise. You'd still be able to loot the chest if you got the key though, just won't get the .

Geralt concludes it should have passed through Hangman's Alley, so head there to begin your search.
Once you arrive, a couple drowners and a water hag will be nearby and attack. Deal with them, then search near the fast travel signpost to find the wagon's tracks along the road. Follow them south where they'll eventually turn off the road and into the forest. Continue following and you'll find the wagon, in bad shape. There's a few things to examine, like some inventory logs listing catoblepas meat and a blood trail. If you follow it, a rotfiend will be near the body and attack. You can then loot the body for a note. However, what you really want is in a chest beneath the wagon that contains Keira's package, amazingly intact. However, there is nothing magical about it. (25)
Note: If you want continued access to Keira as a vendor (and she's the only guaranteed vendor of greater runes anywhere near this level), you might want to wait on continuing this questline at the point before going to dinner with her as described below, and come back to it later.
Mice and Wine[]
Bring the items back to Keira and after pointing out none of it's magical, she'll say if you wait a bit, she'll show you what it's for. If you decline, you can still return to her later, but once you agree, she'll shoo you outside. After a cutscene, you can agree to play along as Prince Charming or not. If you say no, the quest will fail here and there'll be no way to continue. If you agree, she'll then ask to cast another spell to make both your clothes look fancy, but you can choose not to so without repercussions. Afterwards, she'll challenge you to a race to the spot.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Greedy_God,Velen,"At Wastrel Manor in Velen, follow the road south until you come across some ruins where two peasants, Dagmar and Preben, are talking. Interact with them and they'll explain that they're making an offering to their deity, the Allgod, who has been responsible for protecting and blessing them - or so they think. One of their forefathers had reportedly been out gathering brushwood when a bush caught fire - a miracle as far as he was concerned - and out of nowhere a voice spoke to him demanding offerings and worship. However, the Allgod has cursed them as their offerings are meager on account of the war going on. Agree to speak on their behalf to start the quest.
Approach the statue and talk to the ""deity"" who will claim he will bring his wrath down on the village, like avalanches, if they do not bring him better food. Considering the geography though, this is impossible, not to mention the voice came from underground.
Use Witcher Senses and you'll notice a crack in the wall and a bottle nearby that smells of vinegar. Follow the trail to just behind a wall to some rubble that's really an illusion and use the Eye of Nehaleni here to reveal a hidden cellar. Heading downstairs, you find the Allgod: a sylvan who's gotten fat by proclaiming to be a deity so the villagers will feed him. You now have a few choices:
Kill him
Convince him to accept the meager offerings
Don't bargain at all
No matter what you choose, you'll earn 25  and can then let the peasants know the outcome.
If you killed him, they'll get upset despite telling them it was a common monster and you'll earn 50  and they leave for Claywich
If you didn't bargain they'll resign to emptying out all their food in storage, earning 50 
If you did bargain, they'll be grateful and you earn 50  and 50
Note that if you let him live, you can also mention the cellar to them or not. If you do and you chose to bargain, you get an extra 50 and 50 . Bug: sometimes the quest will give this automatically, even if you didn't reveal the cellar. No matter what though, the quest will then conclude.
Later on, if you told the peasants about the cellar, you'll find that the cellar is now covered up in rubble, though it's unclear if this was their doing or the Allgod's. If you didn't tell them about it though, you'll find a group of worshipers while Allgod laments over not having anything nicer to eat (this happens regardless if you bargained or not).","Address the Allgod using the altar.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Towerful_of_Mice,Velen,"Follow the objective marker to Keira's moored boat, which she kindly offered for Geralt's use, or swim or find another boat to take to the isle. From the safety of the boat it's obvious that this island has a monster infestation. Geralt can circle the island to look for the best place to land or land as close to the tower as possible.
Defeat any rotfiends, drowners, or ghouls that lurk between you and the tower entrance before heading inside. Along the trail Geralt will find recent remains of several locals but no evidence that it was the monsters in the area that caused these deaths. Also beware of any small black clouds on the island as these are swarms of black flies. However, they can be dispelled by using the Igni sign. Just in front of the tower there will be a water hag that you have to kill as well.
Note: There are three places of haunting located outside the tower, and four inside the tower with one of those in the basement. Use the lantern on them to see a brief conversation between spirits as they reenact some of their last moments. Each except one give 50  if watched, and the last one gives 100. However, the objective to watch them won't complete before using the lamp for a non-optional purpose.
Fyke Isle Tower[]
Locations of spirits outside the castle
On entering the tower, it's quickly noticeable the place has a high rat population. If Geralt uses the lamp he can watch the last moments of the peasants killed in the past and learns more about the events that transpired on the island during the massacre. One body is fairly fresh, having been killed recently by an unknown foe. Keira directs Geralt to find the mage's lab, which is at the top of the tower. However, the entrance is hidden so Geralt must use the two levers in the false top of the tower to reveal the passageway. Once inside the lab, use the mage's lamp to meet the ghost of the former lord's daughter, Anabelle.
She tells Geralt of how the mage, Alexander, had been experimenting with rats and infecting them with a disease called Catriona. One day, peasants came to the island and broke into the tower to kill everyone there. Terrified by this, she drank a potion that the mage had given her, thinking it'd kill her. Instead, it was a strong paralyzing potion that put her in a deathlike slumber to make the peasants think she had killed herself, so they left after killing everyone else. However, when she awoke, she was still paralyzed and the rats ate her alive.
Geralt explains to her that the curse on the island is obviously centered around her and, as it was born from hate, only love can break it. He then suggests that to break the curse, she has to forgive her love, Graham, who left her alone on the isle, having believed she had died. She claims she is ready to forgive Graham, but only if Geralt brings her bones to Graham for him to bury. Geralt can choose to agree or refuse the request. In order to have the option to refuse, Geralt had to have used the magic lamp to witness the murder of the looter.
Breaking the Curse[]
Refusing Anabelle's request: If Geralt refuses to bring Anabelle's bones to Graham, she asks Geralt to bring Graham to her. However, as he refused to take her bones to Graham, she already doesn't trust Geralt and reveals herself as a plague maiden and attacks him. Geralt is able to fight her, but she can't die until the curse is broken. Keira advises Geralt to see Graham, who lives just north in Oreton, about lifting the curse. Geralt goes to Graham to inform him of the curse and about Anabelle becoming a pesta, explaining that if she forgives Graham the curse will be broken, but he needs to be there to prove his love to her.
The two head back to the island where they are attacked by wraiths of the curse's victims, who blame Graham for their misery, before finally making it to the top of the tower where the pesta awaits. Graham explains to Anabelle that he didn't mean to leave her and that he still loves her so she asks him to prove it by kissing her. Graham kisses her and, as she returns to human form, he dies and is reunited with her in death, lifting the curse. (500)
Bringing the Bones to Graham: Once Geralt acquires the bones, he takes them to the fisherman, Graham, who'll admit his role in allowing the peasants access to the island that led to the massacre, though he didn't know that his love was still alive when she drank the potion. Geralt gives her bones to Graham to bury and leaves. However, before he gets too far, Geralt hears a scream from Graham's cabin and rushes back in to find him dead, his body surrounded by rats with Anabelle floating over him in her true appearance as a plague maiden. Now that the bones are off the island, the curse is broken, but the pesta is now free to roam the world and spread the plague, almost ruining Kerack in the process. (300)
Leaving the conversation If Geralt decides to leave the conversation and proceeds to leave the tower, the Pesta will lock the door and appear before him and attack. This path leads the story as if Geralt refuses Anabelle's request.
Return to Keira[]
Once the curse is lifted, Geralt returns to Keira, explaining the situation. Before he leaves, Keira asks Geralt for one more favor. Note: this conversation is a cutoff point for the small secondary quest Lynch Mob.

Getting down to business, Keira will ask Geralt for a small favor: she needs help removing the curse that seems to be hanging over Fyke Isle in the middle of Lake Wyndamer. She says that the curse is supposedly linked to Vserad, the former lord of the area before the Nilfgaardian invasion.

The man in question, John Verdun, is tied up on the shoreline and surrounded by drowners. Take care of them, then speak with John to decide his fate.
It appears that the man was a former Temerian soldier but his army was destroyed by the Nilfgaardians after which he deserted. When the refugees he was fleeing with found out that he was a deserter they tied him up and left him. If Geralt should point out he doesn't believe refugees would tie him up to die simply for being a deserter, John insinuates there may be a bit more to the story but doesn't say anything else.

Albin will ask Geralt to defend him and his men from the necrophages drawn to the battlefield by the stench of death so his workers can loot the bodies. Accept the quest to start the waves of monsters.
Protect the scavengers[]
The ghouls will all come from the south-southeast part of the yellow area on your map, so your best chance if you want Albin to live is to be near this spot to prevent Albin from trying to recklessly engage the monsters. You will face 4 waves here: first two will have 3 ghouls each, the third with 2 ghouls and a rotfiend, and the fourth with 3 ghouls. Note that the last wave can spawn while you're still dealing with the previous, making it a bit more difficult.
Bandits on horseback may also be present around the southern edge of the marked area if they had not been previously killed. They belong to a nearby deserter camp denoted on the map by a person(s) in distress marker and can make this even tougher. Bandits may still spawn even after the marker has been cleared.
If Albin survives, then after the final wave go back and talk to him. After Geralt speaks to him he'll reward you 50 and 50  and the quest will complete. This outcome also qualifies you for a discount from the shady merchant on a fake pass if the pass has not yet been obtained.
Note: Depending on your performance Albin may pay you an additional reward up to 50 making the maximum reward 100 This appears to be related to how many of his workers survive till the end.
If Albin dies but at least one of his men survives, then a surviving looter will pay Geralt 20  once all the monsters in the area are defeated, and the quest will complete (earning 50 ).
The quest fails if Albin and his entire team die, but Geralt still receives 15 . Note that subsequently informing the shady merchant of Albin's death fails the Fake Papers quest.","Protect the scavengers from monsters.
Talk to the scavengers' supervisor."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Ties,Velen,"Near the merchants in the camp is a noblewoman sitting under a makeshift tent and, on talking to her, she'll ask for Geralt's help as none of the soldiers there will tell her what happened to her son, Hrodeberth. When agreed to, she'll then suggest talking to the quartermaster, Tavar Eggebracht, so make your way over to talk to him.
You have a few options here:
pay him 150  (earns 15 )
use Axii (requires Delusion level 2, earns 35 )
if Contract: Patrol Gone Missing was completed without investigating further, he'll tell you by just asking
Whatever you choose, Eggebracht will then reveal that the boy and his group attempted to desert and some were caught and hanged while the others fled into the nearby swamps. However, he doesn't know if Hrodeberth was among those hanged or not.
Head to the spot northwest of the House of Respite and once you enter the search area, use your Witcher Senses to find some tracks near a dead horse and examine both, then follow the tracks, where you'll come across a body to examine but it's not Hrodeberth. Continue following the tracks, where you may run into some ghouls, before finding several hanged men, one of which has red hair. Examine this body, then after Geralt comments he needs definite proof it's him, use Witcher Senses to find the unsent letter just below the body.
Return to the mother who will ask for the truth and Geralt will reveal that he's dead. You can then choose to lie in how he died or tell her the truth in that he deserted. Regardless of choice, she'll thank the witcher and reward him for his efforts with 10  and 50 .","Talk to the quartermaster about the noblewoman's son.
Find Hrodeberth's body using your Witcher Senses.
Search the site for personal artifacts using your Witcher Senses.
Return to the mother."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Caravan_Attack,Velen,"Locate the caravan heading along the dirt pathways near the ponds, northwest of Marauders' Bridge. An easy way to find it is by sticking to the path between this bridge and the abandoned site further west. Sounds of commotion from up ahead will prompt you to interject in a fight between two merchants and a group of five bandits.
Slay the men fighting the merchants then speak to the pair, Anselm and Griswold, to learn their hiring methods are somewhat lacking. Despite their impoverished state, Anselm gives a reward of 25 + 20 , concluding the quest. A week later, he will arrive at Crow's Perch, making Anselm a merchant in the village that you can sell and buy goods with.
However, it is also possible that both merchants die, though very unlikely as they're quite resilient. If that happens, there is still a reward for killing the bandits. After they're finished off, a chest on the merchants' wagon will be filled with 20 , 5 deer hides, 5 bear hides, 5 spools of thread, and a stack of 4 cured leathers, plus the merchants' bodies can be looted as well - no , but a lot more coin value.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Ciri%27s_Room,Velen,"Looking for any information that can lead him to Ciri, Geralt searches the room that Ciri had occupied. The following clues can be found inside the room which is located on the middle floor of the castle across from the kitchens:
A spinning top
Ciri's clothes
The Natural Obscurity of Curses
Open up the inventory and read the book. Apparently Ciri was researching curses for some reason. Additionally, the Baron and his wife appear to have friends in high places in Vizima by the looks of the dedication in the book.
Head into the kitchen, which is just across the hall, to find Gretka and speak with her. Geralt may ask for information about Ciri but Gretka seems to know little despite being as helpful as can be. She will show the witcher a special gift left to her by Ciri, a green stone, which Geralt says is very valuable. Give the spinning top to Gretka to complete the quest.","Examine the room where Ciri stayed using your Witcher Senses.
Read the book entitled ""The Natural Obscurity of Curses"" from Ciri's room.
Go to the kitchen and talk to Gretka."

Gwent: Old Pals
Master Armorers
Never Trust Children"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Death_By_Fire,Velen,"On the road west of Codgers' Quarry, you'll find a couple huts, with one of them on fire and several bandits outside, watching it, while someone cries for help inside. Approach and the bandits will tell you to ""piss off"". You can say there's a third option, which will instantly make them attack you, or say it's none of your concern. If you go with the latter, you can change your mind and attack once out of the conversation. If you leave though, the hut will eventually burn down and you'll get nothing.
If you attack the men, you can choose to use Aard now and unblock the door for the elf, who'll then run out and use her bow to aid you, or finish off the bandits first then help her out. Regardless, after all the bandits are dead, talk to her and she'll thank you, explaining that they wanted to rob her but when she refused to tell them where her gold was, they came back, barricaded her in, and set fire to the hut. As thanks, she'll tell you to check a tree stump just behind her house for your reward, earning 25 . The stump is easy to find using your Witcher Senses and is located near one of the back corners of the hut and contains 20 . Note that if you don't talk to the elf, it'll treat it as if you passed by without saving her and the quest will fail instead.
Don't forget to loot the bandits' bodies, as one of them always drops Alder Folk boots.","Defeat the bandits.
If Geralt didn't let her out during the fight:
Clear the doorway and free the elf.
Talk to the survivor."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Defender_of_the_Faith,Velen,"To start the quest you'll need to find the old woman who can be encountered at 2 of the 3 shrine locations:
between Blackbough and Crow's Perch
at Duén Hen
Regardless how you find her, fix the shrine for her and she'll ask if you can fix the rest, earning 10 .
However, two more shrines need to be fixed in Velen and while the level for this quest is 10, there are high leveled enemies between the two shrines in lower Velen, particularly a griffin if you stick to the main roads, so be mindful of this.
Note that while it doesn't matter what order you fix them, as you'll earn 25  at the second, if you do the one at Duén Hen second, you'll encounter an endrega warrior, while if you do the unmarked location between Byways and Frischlow there will be wolves, so if you're looking to avoid as many fights as possible, it's best to find the woman at Duén Hen then do the one near Crow's Perch second (as it doesn't spawn anything).
The last location is where you'll run into the vandals destroying the shrines. Letting them do as they please fails the quest, but beating them up (or killing them) completes it, earning 50 .","Fix all the damaged shrines. 2/3
Defeat the vandals. (50)"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Face_Me_if_You_Dare!,Velen,"An idiot with a deathwish stands at an intersection of dirt paths close to the bridge into Crow's Perch. This man, Ronvid of the Small Marsh, seeks to challenge you to a duel for Maid Bilberry, and has vowed to slay one hundred knights in her honor. No matter what you choose, he'll force you to fight him. Once his health is knocked down he'll yield and you can choose whatever you like to end this part, earning 25 .
A few days later he'll now appear just southeast of Tretogor Gate, near the Pontar river, this time armed with a shield and a little more armor now. Again, no matter what you say he'll draw you into yet another fight, so beat him up and choose whichever response again to send him on his way, earning another 25 .
A couple days later he'll appear once more, this time inside Novigrad's Silverton district, across from the small market. However, he's not alone, having hired 2 thugs, as he now belatedly realized Geralt's a witcher. You have 3 options:
Fight and kill them all
Say you don't want to fight (will still cause you to have to kill all 3)
Use Axii to get all three to back down (requires Delusion level 2, earns 35 )
Note: Because this part takes place in the middle of Novigrad and not some outskirts it's very likely some patrolling guards or witch hunters will join in. However, they will attack Ronvid and his pals for starting it, which will make the fight more easy. That is unless you resolved the issue with Axii.
No matter what you went with, afterwards the quest concludes, earning 50 . Note that if you kill Ronvid, you can loot his body for the letter To the Most Beautiful Woman in the World.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Fake_Papers,Velen,"Due to the war, King Radovid V has closed off all the borders into Redania and is only allowing those with a pass through. Naturally, these passes aren't easy to obtain and thus the shady merchant has made some counterfeits for those willing to pay for them. You can do the following:
pay the full 100  (earning 10 )
ask for another way then use Axii (requires Delusion level 1, earning 30 ). This will lower it to 50  and earn 5  when paid for
ask about the other way and he'll ask you to help his brother-in-law, Albin Hart
If you buy the pass outright, the quest will end here. However, if you inquire about the other option, you'll need to go do Bitter Harvest to get the price dropped to 25 . Important: If you go this route, make sure to keep Albin alive. If he dies and you report this to the merchant, he will refuse to deal with you and will cause the quest to fail. You can however still opt to not mention the matter and pick one of the other options above.
If you went and helped Albin and he survived, the merchant will sell the pass to you for 25 , earning 2. Regardless, as long as you obtained a pass, the quest will then complete.","See what the counterfeit pass seller's brother-in-law needs.
Return for the discounted pass."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Fists_of_Fury:_Velen,Velen,"This quest may be started via its notice on Crow's Perch's notice board or simply encountering one of the spots where fist fights take place.
Stan Fishgulper can be found in front of Lindenvale's inn. Before you start, he'll ask to speak to you in private. He knows he can't beat you, but he really needs the prize, a sack of flour, so he can have some food. You can choose to throw the match or not. Problem is you already placed your bet, so if you bet the maximum 70 this will be a poor choice for you, so if you intend to do it then it's best to reload the game and place the minimum bet before the match which is a measly 1. If you do throw it, you can then do a re-match, this time beating him. If you don't throw the match, you can speak with Fishgulper after the fight to offer him money so he can buy food for his family (5 ), which he will happily accept. Once you beat him you'll earn 25 .
The other two regular fighters, Jonah and Smithy, will fistfight as normal, earning 25  after each win. Once you've defeated all 3 (doesn't matter which order) you can then face the Sergeant in Crow's Perch.
The group will be fistfighting in the courtyard near the barn. Interact with him and place your bet. Once you defeat the Sergeant, the quest will complete, earning 75  and 160 .
Note: The Sergeant will not be available to challenge until after the conclusion of the main quest Family Matters. Approaching him before this will only result in him dismissing Geralt with ""Nothing here for you.""","Defeat Smithy.
Defeat Fishgulper.
Defeat Jonah.
Fight the sergeant for the Velen title.
Bugs
When at Crows Perch, the Sergeant will not acknowledge Geralt, instead staying in the Bloody Barons barracks room. Not sure how, why this happens even though all other fights are won. (This is due to him not being available to fight until after the Baron leaves Crow's Perch at the conclusion of Family Matters).

Never Trust Children"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Fools%27_Gold,Velen,"To start this quest, head to Lurtch where, just southeast of the signpost, are 3 friendly enough bandits roasting a hog, and you may or may not see Yontek blabbering about, depending on how you approached the area. Talk to one of the bandits who are so happy to have found a nice meal that they offer you a slice. You can accept or politely refuse with no difference, as they will still prepare to cut into it when Yontek runs over and starts crying about them eating Yagoda. The bandits have had enough with this guy though and prepare to kill him and a timed reaction shows here. If you choose to walk away, there's no other way to start this quest.
Tell the bandits to back off, which will lead to you having to kill them. Afterwards, talking with Yontek will reveal there are others in the village, taken by ""piggy magic"". Head into the nearest hut and use your Witcher Senses to examine a pig to see that Yontek's right, they're magical. Go back to talk to Yontek and he'll eventually give you a key to a ""hog hut"" and gives you vague directions, but your map marker will show it's a location between Reardon Manor and Toderas.
While heading out on the road, it's best to take care of nekkers along the way, especially if you plan to finish this quest without doing anything else. You may see some ghouls on the way too, but they can be safely avoided. When you arrive at the cave, 3 bandits will be outside. Dispatch of them, then head in, where you have to kill 4 more bandits. Note: this is also the cave where you find the Diagram: Feline steel sword - enhanced.
Now head to the door and use the key and it'll transform to look like a portal, but it's not. Just walk through it into the hidden chamber. Using Witcher Senses, you'll see lots of foot traffic. Further in, you'll find a lone pig and some clothes nearby, most likely belonging to the missing herbalist, Igor. Interact with the pig and talk with him to reveal it's Igor and the place is some kind of temple. Afterwards, head into the last area of the temple to find large statues of pigs and a pedestal between them. Examine this to learn it held gold, then go back to talk to Igor, this time to talk about the gold. Obviously Igor can't converse much as a pig, so you need to head back to ask Yontek about the cursed gold.
However, back at the village wolves are attacking, so you have to take care of them first, then talk to Yontek. He'll reveal he wasn't cursed because he didn't go with the villagers, and he knows where the gold is. While he gathers the gold, you need to go around and herd the pigs/villagers. You just need to use Axii on one pig in each hut to get them moving, though getting the casting right can be tricky. You have to face one of the pigs and use Axii on it while the word ""pig"" is appearing.
Once they're all gathered, it's time to head to the cave. Thankfully it won't make you go the full way, just to the area of Mowshurst before cutting to the temple. However, you'll have to deal with enemies before you get there. You'll only have to deal with a handful of nekkers that'll pop up around the area, but there's a higher level nekker warrior with them. Despite a count showing you can potentially lose pigs, the nekkers that pop up for this will only go for Geralt. After reaching Mowshurst, a cutscene triggers and the curse is lifted with everyone back to normal. However, they quickly round on Yontek, blaming him for what happened. You can choose to step away, in which case they'll kill him and you'll get 100 , or defend him and they'll back off (but no monetary reward). The quest will then complete, earning 50 .","Defeat the looters.

When you get close enough to it, a cutscene plays out as Keira exits the structure, pocketing Alexander's notes on the Catriona plague. (50) She admits that she is planning to bargain with Radovid, believing that he'll pardon her for her association with the Lodge by giving him the notes. The conversation with her can go 3 different ways: kill her, let her go to Radovid, or convince her to go to Kaer Morhen.
If you want her to go to Kaer Morhen (100):
the quickest conversation path is to ask about the notes, ""Radovid never forgets"", ""It's suicide"", and then the fourth option will let you suggest Kaer Morhen.
This is the only chance you can mention it, after this you either have to let her go or kill her yourself. If you convince her to go to Kaer Morhen, you can then ask for the notes without having to kill her.
If you wish to let her go to Radovid (100):
as soon as you have the option to exit out of the conversation, use it and she'll go parley with Radovid. The quickest route to this is to select ""used"", ""serpent"", and then exit out of the conversation.
it doesn't matter what you pick as long as you don't 1) mention Kaer Morhen 2) demand the notes first and 3) say you can't let her do that [go to Radovid].
If you wish to kill her (200):
The quickest path to such a route is to selected ""used"", ""serpent"", then demand the notes, which will lead to a fight and her death.
selecting any option where you either demand the notes first or tell her you can't let her do that will cause her to fight you which will, unfortunately, lead to her death and Geralt will burn Alexander's notes.
Consequences (spoilers)[]
If you convince Keira to go to Kaer Morhen, she will join you for The Battle of Kaer Morhen.
If she doesn't go to Kaer Morhen, the Brothers In Arms: Velen quest later will automatically fail.
If you let Keira go to Radovid (or didn't do the quest at all), this will later unlock the secondary quest A Final Kindness.","Find out what Keira's doing in the tower on Fyke Isle.
Find Keira. (50)
If you had to kill Keira:
Defeat Keira. (200)"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Forefathers%27_Eve,Velen,"After completing A Towerful of Mice, the pellar will contact you at one of two possible locations, depending on whether the botchling part of Family Matters has already been completed or not. If it was, he will contact you at Crow's Perch near Fergus Graem's forge, otherwise the pellar will be outside Keira's hut. In any case, the pellar will ask you to help protect him and a group of villagers during the Forefathers' Eve ritual on Fyke Isle.
You must meet him at the stone circle on the isle at midnight, however this really means just at night, so as early as 10pm will work. You'll know you can start when the pellar is chanting as you approach him. Talk to him and you can start. Once you do, you'll need to fight off all the monsters that will attack during the ritual.
The Ritual[]
Once the ritual begins, it'll start to rain and the pellar will lead a chant. Once he says ""Let's begin Forefathers' Eve"" a water hag with several drowners and a couple drowned dead will appear and attack you. Note that Geralt's vitality is fully restored once the water hag and drowners are defeated.
Once you defeat them, the pellar will summon a ghost, who turns out to be his father, Ambros. However he is interrupted by three witch hunters who believe that the ritual is a rite of necromancy. You can either chose to keep defending the pellar and peasants or you can leave (which will end the quest). Whichever choice you make, you'll get 200 , either after declining to fight them or after the second part of the ritual. Note that choosing to not help the pellar here will make him unavailable as a merchant in the future.
If you choose to defend the pellar, kill the witch hunters, which will unfortunately taint the ritual grounds with blood, thus unintentionally calling the ghosts of men who seek to kill. In this case, it means wraiths will appear and the pellar helps you fight them. Note: the amount of witch hunters and wraiths appearing can be up to 4 each, but depends on difficulty level.
Burn the body[]
After the confrontation, Geralt will inform the pellar he needs to permanently destroy his father's body to prevent his wraith from returning and the pellar will say it lies in the swamps. Thankfully your marker is a bit more precise and will show a location west of The Orphans of Crookback Bog. Make your way out here and use your Witcher Senses to find it. You'll most likely run into some rotfiends, so take care of them, then head towards the very center of the search area, and you should find the remains. Once found, examine it then ignite the corpse with Igni to destroy it and its ties to the world.
Return to the pellar's hut and tell him that you took care of the body. Doing so will finish the quest, earning you 50 + 50 , and unlocks a 10% discount with all merchants (regardless of type) in Velen and White Orchard. However, be aware that this also reduces the selling price of items.","Meet the pellar in the stone circle on Fyke Isle at midnight.
If you said you need to prepare:
Talk to the pellar and prepare for Forefathers' Eve.
Protect the ritual's participants.
If you choose to side with the pellar:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Funeral_Pyres,Velen,"This quest is started by speaking to the priest of the Eternal Fire along the road just west of Mulbrydale. The guards standing nearby will initially warn off Geralt but the priest will ask you to approach. He'll be rather condescending but nonetheless asks you to do him a job by setting fire to several of the dead on the battlefield for a proper rite. He then gives you holy oil to set afire at each location.
The bodies can be burned in any order you choose with each spot having a number of enemies.
Just southwest of the priest and his guards. A rotfiend and possibly a few wild dogs may block your path but once dispatched use the holy oil on the bodies in the pit and ignite them with Igni.
Directly north of the first pit, over the hill and down into the thicket. Once the four ghouls are defeated, set fire to the bodies in the pit.
A fair distance away to the southeast is a site with several ghouls.
No matter what order you did them, the first 2 pyres will give 10  each, however the last site you get to will have a single man fending off a pack of ghouls. Intervene quickly to save the man who will introduce himself as Titus Gielas. Important: Titus can die here so make sure to jump in quickly to keep him alive if you wish to learn more and get more of a reward.
If he survived, Titus will immediately mention a priest and if you ask further on this, Titus will reveal that he was attacked and left to die there by the very same priest who contracted the witcher to burn the bodies as the priest was a fisstech customer of his but on the last trade decided to kill off Titus, then hired Geralt to burn the evidence, earning 25 . However, if you chose ""nonsense"" instead, you won't earn the 25  or learn this information. Regardless what you chose, once the conversation is complete go burn the bodies to complete the objective, earning 10 .
Meet with the priest near the Border Post and, depending on what you learned, you have a few options.
If Titus died or you didn't question him about the priest, you'll only earn 20  and 50 
If Titus was questioned about the priest:
You can accept the priest's bribe, earning 60  and 50 
You can refuse the bribe, resulting in having to kill the 3 men. While you only earn 50  here, make sure to loot the priest's body for 200
No matter what you choose, the quest will then end.","Find and burn the bodies lying in pits on the battle field. 3/3
Return to the priest of the Eternal Fire."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Ghosts_of_the_Past,Velen,"While exploring Velen's countryside near Lindenvale, or taking on The Fall of the House of Reardon contract, Geralt stumbles across a farmstead which is littered with booby traps. Search around and, as you approach to enter one of the buildings, you may hear a sound coming from the barn. Enter the barn and search for a ladder to get up to the loft, only to find Letho there. (25)
Letho explains his situation - after the events that transpired at Loc Muinne, he has been on the run and in hiding ever since, as Emhyr now sees him as a threat due to being an ""unnecessary"" witness.
Suddenly, men approach the farmstead - clearly no ordinary lost peasants. Letho explains that only one man, a supposed friend, knew where he was, Louis. No matter your choice, he'll basically drag you into the fight so you have to help kill the headhunters. (50)
Afterwards, Letho will mention hunting down Louis and you can choose to tag along or not. If you want more  and his help later during the Battle of Kaer Morhen, go with him and make sure to stay close. Otherwise, if you stray too far, the quest will complete and you'll never see him again. Meanwhile, despite his growls to ""stick closer,"" you may loot all the corpses first if you want.
Finding Louis[]
If you chose to go along, follow Letho on horseback to a small camp where Louis and his gang are located. After some small talk, Letho decides his ""friend"" is a traitor and must die. Help kill off the bandits and then another cutscene unfolds with a badly wounded Louis asking for mercy, and he'll eventually reveal who paid him off. Letho chooses to let him die there from his wounds and heads out to find Arnout Vester. (50) Note: you can manually attack Louis after the cutscene, though killing him doesn't grant anything.
Dealing with the Bounty Hunters[]
Now ride along to Lindenvale to see if Louis spoke the truth. Letho leads you to a hut on the edge of the village and tells Geralt, to not interfere no matter what. A cutscene will then play out where Letho blows up a nearby barn to draw out the men inside the hut and a conversation plays out between Letho and Vester, eventually leading to one of the mercenaries shooting a bolt into Letho's shoulder. Letho attacks, taking down most of the men before falling himself. Geralt then runs forward and has 2 choices: intervene or stay out of trouble.
If Geralt chooses to intervene, a fight will ensue and the attackers will be killed.
If Geralt chooses to defuse the situation by insisting he doesn't want trouble, the men will want to claim the bounty placed on Letho and subsequently decide to take his head - an idea Geralt isn't fond of. You can convince them to take Letho's medallion instead as proof.
Afterwards, Geralt investigates the corpse of Letho only to discover that a unique poison had been applied, making him only appear dead. When Letho comes around, he reveals that this was his plan all along: to appear to die in front of the bounty hunters so they'll spread the word Letho is dead and he will no longer be hunted. If Geralt intervened, Letho will react negatively as he ruined the plan, but if Geralt stayed out of trouble, he'll be pleased.
Regardless of your previous choice, you can now bid him farewell or invite him to stay at Kaer Morhen. If you choose Kaer Morhen, he'll eventually make his way there to help with the battle. If you don't invite him to the school, he'll instead talk about going to Zerrikania.","Search the farmstead.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Gwent:_Velen_Players,Velen,"The quest may be started by either finding the notice on Crow's Perch or Midcopse's notice boards, or directly by challenging the Bloody Baron who uses the Northern Realms deck. Once defeated he will hand over the Sigismund Dijkstra card and give you the names of Velen's best players: Haddy, Old Sage, and a boatwright.
Note: As of Patch 1.20, if you didn't defeat him before the secondary quest Return to Crookback Bog, you can find the Baron's card attached to the list of players in his office. However, it only appears there after the quest has been started, so if it's not active yet look for the notice.
No matter how you obtain the list, now you can go play the other three in no particular order.
The Old Sage is in Benek and plays the Monsters deck and gives the Crone: Weavess card.
Haddy is a young boy in Midcopse, but don't let his age fool you. He plays with the Northern Realms deck and if beaten will give the Vernon Roche card.
The boatwright lives in Oreton and can be found near the middle of the village with the boats. He uses the Nilfgaardian deck and will give the Letho of Gulet card.
Once you beat all of them, you'll earn the Monsters leader's card, Eredin: Destroyer of Worlds.","Win a unique card from the baron.

Close to the river bank is a small collection of rocks, a campfire, and a larger collection of five nekkers intent on swarming over a hapless rock troll. Join in the fray and slay all of the nekkers.
Afterwards, Boris informs you that his culinary tastes (nekker soup) may have influenced the attack. A dialogue will pop up where it doesn't matter what you say, only a different funny conversation will follow. At the end, Boris will give Geralt an elf head and the quest will then complete. (25)
Don't forget to check for loot around, as the two bundles near the pot have 2 random diagrams each!",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Hazardous_Goods,Velen,"Just northwest of Lurtch, on the main road, you can come across a cart full of dead plague victims and several ghouls running around with a man trapped under the cart. Proximity sensitive: once the quest appears in your logs, don't travel too far away, otherwise it'll fail.
Kill the ghouls and talk to the man, Gert Borel, to find out he ran into some bad luck where his cart's axle broke and when the ghouls howled, his horse spooked and tipped over the cart, burying him under the dead bodies. He'll then point out this is how he makes his living: carting away the bodies of plague victims as he's adamant he won't catch it as he never gets ill.
You can then depart now, or convince him (10) he needs to burn the cart and the bodies.
If you choose to burn the cart and bodies, simply use Igni to set fire to the cart (10) and Geralt will then tell Gert to burn his clothes and scrub himself down, though Gert will remark it seems unnecessary as he never catches anything. Important: if you told him to burn it, you need to burn it while still here. Once you travel too far away, the quest will automatically fail if you didn't.
While the quest will finish here, no matter what you told him, several weeks later you can find Gert between Reardon Manor and Benek, between several Nekker nests. You then discover that he did, in fact, catch the plague and he asks Geralt to kill him, thus sparing him the misery. You can either choose to kill him or not, as there are no repercussions for either choice. If you choose to kill him (earning 25 ), you can set fire to his body like the other plague victims.","Help the trapped man.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Highwayman%27s_Cache,Velen,"A little farther east of Boatmakers' Hut is a trail leading to a bridge over to Bandits' Camp, an island of thugs. Guarding the bridge are three bandits, who don't attack but instead engage you in conversation. They want your coin to pass safely over the bridge. You can:
Tell them to try and take your coin, which starts a fight where you must then kill all three.
Show them your medallion, which causes one of the bandits to pause. Recognizing it as a witcher medallion, they decide it's best not to challenge you and depart without incident.
Afterwards, use your Witcher Senses at their campfire to follow some footprints to a partly-hidden chest in the weeds under the bridge. Pry it open for some coin and a couple of diagrams.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/In_the_Eternal_Fire%27s_Shadow,Velen,"The quest is given by a young Eternal Fire deacon just outside Devil's Pit in Velen, who's just finished his studies and is intent on helping people. In this case, he wishes to have the abandoned mine system at the Devil's Pit cleared of whatever horrors it contains from way back when the Eternal Fire used it to isolate scarlet fog victims. Depending if you've already done Funeral Pyres or not, you can bring up what happened there if you learned the truth about that priest, but this won't have an effect in this conversation. The young deacon won't have much information to give you about the job but once you accept, will give you the key to unlock the mine's gate.
The first area, to the right up in the small shack, you'll find Reinald's note discussing the situation and his guesses. Continuing further, at the next set of doors into the mine, you'll find his first letter pinned there, revealing Reinald's also a witcher. As you open these doors, you'll hear a voice call out to you asking you to hurry and help them as torches light up to guide you.
Note: While the magic lamp can be used at multiple locations in this mine, it's entirely optional as it just gives some insight into the events that happened there, as there's no speaking voices and it won't open up extra dialogue for later.
At this point you can either go into the small shack in front of you or proceed down the steps as the voice is trying to get you to do. If you want to look around though, use your Witcher Senses to notice the old School of the Wolf insignia on the shack in front of you and then, inside the shack in the back right room, you'll find some bones emitting a red light that you can examine. If you went into the shack, when you exit the voice gets angry and demands you to hurry up as it makes the barrels in the cart fly off.
Head down the stairs and you'll find a split path, where the voice tries to guide you to the right, but you'll likely notice immediately on the left path a crawling corpse, which Geralt will remark on. It'll disappear shortly where you examine the wolf insignia on the left path's floor.
At this point you have a few options here: explore the mine to the left to learn more of the background story, or go right as the voice demands. If you just want to finish the quest quickly, you can go right without any dire consequences (as long as you select the right dialogue choices at the end), though you won't get access to Reinald's Philter, which might be helpful if you're at a low level for this quest. Note also the mines will be locked again at the end of this quest, so if you want to do any exploring, you need to do it during this quest.
If you went right immediately, you'll soon enter a slightly large shack area where 4 non-hostile beings similar to the one you saw are standing around. Proceed through and up the stairs and jump across to the large doors here, where Reinald's fifth letter is pinned. Entering it, you'll see Reinald pinned in some of the salt stalagmites, calling out to you to destroy the stalagmites to free him. Once you destroy them with Aard, this is the point of no return so this is your last chance to explore before you do.
Meeting Reinald[]
The dialogue that happens next, once you free him, varies if you explored or not. If you explored around and made Reinald's Philter, he'll note his strength is fading and that the red miasmal has almost taken over. He'll then ask you to give the Philter to him so he can expel it. In this case, there's a few optional dialogue choices here to test him. If you offer him the potion, the real Reinald will break through for a bit and knocks it to the floor so it can't be used as he tells you the spirit has taken over. Otherwise if you choose to keep it, the real Reinald will warn you to drink it and finish the work he started. If you didn't explore, as soon as you free him, Reinald will instead begin to laugh and reveal it's not Reinald, but rather a possessed form of the witcher and begins to fight.
The first fight here with the possessed Reinald is fairly easy if you paid attention to the notes, otherwise the real Reinald will drop a hint of this during the fight. In particular, the easiest way to deal with him is to use both a Yrden trap and then Aard on the ensnared Reinald (about three times if full health) to defeat him and force the red miasmal out to fight. Otherwise, you can fight him with your sword, though this will take a bit longer as he likes to use Quen.
Once the miasmal is forced out, it'll then fight you directly, periodically teleporting around the room and summoning a couple plague victims to help it out. Note it'll continue to summon these at certain intervals in relation to its health meter, so you could end up in a room with the miasmal and four of the plague victims if you were primarily focused on damaging the miasmal and didn't kill the first set off.
Ending choices[]
After it's defeated, Reinald's spirit will finally be free and will talk to you. You can ask to learn more about the witcher and how long he'd been trapped there. Regardless, as you wrap up your conversation he'll give you his armor and sword diagrams. However, his spirit is obviously restless and needs to find peace before he can leave the world, or you could just burn his body to force him to depart. In this case, you can either choose to bring the deacon to him or burn the body right away. If you choose the latter, Reinald won't fight you.
If you wish to bring the young deacon to Reinald but have him live, the easiest way is to side with the deacon by pointing out he's innocent and he doesn't need the church to do good. The only dialogue branch off ""the boy is innocent"" route that would get him killed is if you didn't use any of the optional conversations and then said that the crimes couldn't be forgiven.
However, if you don't mention the priest that stayed behind beforehand (only given if you explored and learned of this) and then say Reinald is right, Reinald will kill the deacon regardless of your subsequent choices. In this case, the only way to save him on the ""Reinald is right"" dialogue branch is by mentioning that priest beforehand, asking what Reinald would do, and then say that the young deacon doesn't need the church.
There's also a third main option that'll show up if Funeral Pyres wasn't done (or didn't learn the truth about that priest) where Geralt can instead say not all priests are bad (this is a different option from the optional mention of the one that stayed in the mines), but this will lead to the deacon's death as well regardless of the next dialogue choices.","Open the gate to the mine.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Last_Rites,Velen,"At night time, go to the bridge just north of Blackbough where a woman will be standing on the other side from the village and calls to you for help. If you talk to her, she'll reveal she's being haunted by Jackamar, her dead husband, who insists she leave her wedding ring on his gravestone, but the journey is too taxing for her. She'll then mention that her husband died in a battle at Rinde and Geralt remarks she must either be mistaken or really old as that battle happened 80 years ago, and she'll say she meant the Battle of Rivia instead.
At this point, you can decline to help her, which will end the quest here, or help her out. If you agree to help her, she'll tell you where the cemetery is and where to meet her afterwards for your reward, then turns and disappears off the bridge. The cemetery isn't far and is near the Pellar's hut. Using your Witcher Senses, find the husband's grave and examine it then interact to put the ring on it, gaining 10 . After you do this, the spot will then show small green lights that indicate where you can use Keira's magic lamp. Doing so here will show a short conversation and nets you 25 . Now, head into town for your reward.
No matter the time of day, the granddaughter Lessy will be outside her hut sweeping. Talk to her and Geralt will ask to talk to her grandmother and she'll be surprised. Apparently her grandmother died years back and Geralt will then conclude he talked to a ghost. Lessy will then reveal her grandmother originally didn't want to be buried by her husband because she found out he had several lovers on the side, but in the afterlife she must have changed her mind and wanted something to tie her to her husband, thus the ring. As Lessy believes Geralt is being truthful, she'll give him 20 . You'll also gain 25  here and the quest will finish.","Find the old woman's husband's grave using your Witcher Senses.
Place the ring on the grave. (10)
Return to the old woman for a reward. (25)"

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Love%27s_Cruel_Snares,Velen,"After clearing out the abandoned site north of Condyle, a woman will appear crying nearby. Talk to her to learn her fiancé disappeared while checking his snares.
Important: Moving too far away from the area after accepting the quest will cause it to fail.
Follow the tracks nearby until you find a pack of wild dogs around a trap and a body. Once they're killed, examine the body to confirm it's the woman's betrothed, then head back to let her know the bad news.
She'll try to give you a reward, which you can accept or refuse. If you refuse you'll get 60 , otherwise accepting it will give 20  and 40 . No matter what you chose, the quest will then end and the woman will head off to where her fiancé's body is.","Find the woman's missing fiancé in the woods using your Witcher Senses.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Lynch_Mob,Velen,"Near the Hangman's Alley signpost, you come across a peasant lynch mob preparing to hang a Nilfgaardian deserter. You have the option to walk away or interfere and determine the deserter's fate.
The peasants will not listen to your request for leniency, so you have two choices:
Save the deserter by killing the peasants
Leave him to his fate
If you let the mob hang the deserter you can loot the body and find a letter from his wife in which she says she wishes for him to desert and return home to her and their daughter. You won't earn any  here though.
If, however, you kill the peasants, the soldier will be grateful and explain how his wife gave birth to a daughter shortly before he had to leave and he now just wants to return home to them. He'll then set out, ending the quest and earning 25 .",Kill the peasants.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Lamp_(quest),Velen,"On the way out of the Mysterious Elf's hideout, Keira asks Geralt to help her retrieve a magic lamp that the elf promised her. Geralt can either refuse to help and leave, or go with her. If he chooses the latter, the two find themselves in a room with a sealed door. If Geralt initially refused to help Keira but changes his mind before leaving the ruins, he can continue with the quest by following Keira into the room. Note: if agreed to, you must finish up the quest before leaving the ruins, or else it will fail.
Follow Keira into a room and, using Witcher Senses, find an inscription written on the door. With Keira's help, the two are able to translate the Elder Speech to determine that it is a riddle, which describes the order in which the statues' torches have to be lit. The translated riddle reads:
Four guardians, four flames, standing proud in a line. The First to light his fire dared not march on the end. The Second, by the First, played a woeful lament. The Third kept close to his faithful beast. The Fourth marched not beside the First, yet like the Second, played a tune. And thus they stood o'er their queen, who slept beneath flickering stars.
If Geralt lights them all correctly, the door opens. If Geralt lights any brazier out of order the fires will go out and between two and four wraiths will spawn which Geralt will have to fight before attempting to light more braziers. The correct order is: 3rd statue, 2nd statue, 4th statue, and 1st statue.
Once solved, Geralt and Keira can now enter the room beyond which appears to be a sanctuary of sorts. Approach the shrine straight ahead and a cutscene will play. Geralt and Keira muse on the possible origins of the shrine and the implications of its present state. Keira picks up the magic lamp but doesn't quite know what to make of it.
Find an Exit[]
Geralt can now backtrack and return to the exit that was given up when he and Keira went searching for the lamp. However, there is an additional area nearby. Climb up a few stone ledges in the same room as the shrine to find a Place of Power for Yrden, and further a golem protecting a small area with additional loot. This is entirely optional, but two of the chests in there can contain multiple random diagrams, so it is worth fighting for it. There is an additional secret area behind a door that can be removed with Aard to the south of where you fight the golem (near a brazier).
Once on the surface, Geralt and Keira say farewell to one another. Before leaving Keira requests that Geralt come visit her soon as she has a favor to ask of him and after Geralt tacitly agrees to seek her out again, starting An Invitation from Keira Metz and Keira departs through a portal.","Follow Keira.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Man%27s_Best_Friend,Velen,"Along the road northwest of Mulbrydale, you'll find a lone hut with a wild dog outside, trying to get in. Kill it off and, if you don't interact with the door right away, you'll hear children talking inside wondering about you.
Interact with the door and a girl will answer, who'll reveal they haven't had much to eat and are hungry. If you wish, you can ask her more like where are their parents, but she'll reveal they're all essentially alone: orphans or kicked out of their own homes as there were too many mouths to feed. You can then choose to leave or help them.
If you help them (either by giving them food or 25 ) the girl will thank you and give you a few things, notably 10  and the book In Beast's Clothing (which can give the werewolf decoction manuscript and bestiary entries for werewolves and ulfhedinn if you don't have them already) completing the quest.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Races:_Crow%27s_Perch,Velen,"The quest can be started by checking Crow's Perch's notice board. Head out to where the racing starts and talk to the race coordinator, Radko, to start a race against one of the contestants. There are a total of 3 different races you must complete against the following people:
Stuttering Mattko
Iron-Arse Hans
Black Bogdan
Note that each race will ""jump"" ahead in time to 11pm, so if you do them back to back, you'll jump ahead by 3 days. It also doesn't matter which order you beat each competitor, but once you beat one, you can't race them again. Each racer will also give a set amount of crowns and horse equipment (i.e: even if you race Stuttering Mattko last, he'll still give the saddle and 20 ).
The race course is simple enough: just follow the black line on the mini-map, which will go through part of Blackbough and take a sharp turn, over a bridge, and then a pretty straight line to the finish. Like any race, going off course too drastically and/or skipping checkpoints will fail that race and you'll have to re-try.
Also, there are two random obstacles that can appear but you'll only face one of them during a single race, if any. The first is some loose barrels right after the first curve in the course. You'll know if it's coming if time slows down. If that's the case, move as far right of the path as you can get and this should line you up to go right by them without slowing you down. Time will resume as normal right as you pass them. The second possible obstacle is simpler: soon after the bridge you may see a log laying across the path. Most times, Roach will automatically go towards the small opening on the left of this log and continue along the course without any trouble.
When racing Stuttering Mattko, he's considered the easiest of the three as he'll never have an obstacle appear when racing. Once beaten he will give a racing saddle along with 25 and an extra 20  on top of what you wagered.
Iron-Arse Hans is generally the intermediate racer and, more often than not, an obstacle will appear when racing him. When beaten he gives the saddlebags along with 25 and an extra 30  on top of what you wagered.
Black Bogdan is generally the last one to be raced, but obstacles may not show up when racing him. When beaten he gives the horse blinders along with 25 and an extra 40  on top of what you wagered.",Get to the race's starting line.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Return_to_Crookback_Bog,Velen,"Head to Downwarren where, depending on your choice during The Whispering Hillock, the village will either be ravaged and destroyed or no different from when it was last seen. In either case, the Ealdorman will be alive and will tell Geralt and Phillip about a group of witch hunters being led by a lass that recently passed through and went down into the swamps. When you say you're ready, Phillip will call his men and start heading towards the orphanage. Important: don't stray far away from him or else the quest will fail. However, the game is very lenient here and generally you can stray over 150m away before it fails.
Phillip will talk as you make your way through the swamp, before being attacked by some drowners. While his men don't really need to survive, they do fall easily and are useful distractions later, so if you wish, you can run a bit ahead to take them out beforehand. Note though that if you're too far ahead, Phillip and his men will auto-spawn near the drowners and try to kill them. After they're dead, Phillip will talk some more as you continue and shortly another group of enemies, this time with a drowner, two rotfiends, and a water hag, will spawn. Kill this group off, then run to the orphanage to find the witch hunters fighting off more drowners. The short dialogue during this fight depends on if you previously talked to Tamara or not, in which case Graden will either thank you for arriving when you did or asking why the witcher is there.
A Not So Happy Reunion[]
After killing off this group, dialogue will play out, which will vary slightly if you talked to Tamara in Oxenfurt or not. If you did, she'll think you're there to take her back to her father, but if you never met she'll introduce herself. The dialogue will then change where she shows her obvious dislike of her father and Phillip will ask Geralt to explain to Tamara that he's there to find Anna. You can respond however you wish before Graden breaks into the conversation and the witch hunters search the buildings.
This part of the scene varies slightly if you saved the spirit after being given the task by the ealdorman, killed it, or saved it before being given the task. If the first, Anna has been transformed into a grave hag as punishment for the orphans disappearing while the other two choices will show Anna as herself but not there mentally, having gone mad from the loss of the children as they were taken by the Crones to be eaten. Regardless, Tamara will be distraught, asking what can be done. Before more can be said though, a monstrous howl is heard: the signal the Crones have sent something to attack them.
You have a short time before the attack, so prepare your signs, weapons, and such while you can. The wave will be several drowners and a couple water hags and, once the last one is down, a fiend will immediately appear. Once all are killed off, you'll gain 200. What follows next depends on Anna's condition.
Anna's Gone Mad[]
A small cutscene will play out where Phillip decides he'll take Anna to a mysterious hermit in the Blue Mountains with the hope that the hermit can cure Anna's addled mind. Tamara's determined to go with them, but Graden reminds her of her new obligations with the witch hunters, as the deal was to just find her mother. She then makes her father swear he'll take care of Anna and to let her know as soon as her mother is better before watching her father leave the swamps with Anna.
In this case, the quest ends here (300) and you receive your payment of 100  on the spot. However, you may still return to Crow's Perch and see the aftermath of the Bloody Baron leaving, plus a couple of events yielding a bit of extra .
Anna's a Grave Hag[]
Tamara will implore the witcher to help lift the curse but Geralt can't undo it without knowing what the curse was. However, Johnny may have seen something so it's time to find the godling again.
Travel to the map marker and kill some drowners and a water hag outside Johnny's burrow but after calling for Johnny to come out, it becomes apparent that Johnny isn't actually at home. Using your Witcher Senses, follow Johnny's tracks to a small camp where he's sleeping. When questioned, Johnny will tell Geralt all about the Crones' punishment towards Anna for letting the children escape. He'll then state that they took a lock of her hair and went down into the basement of the main building and shortly after Anna began screaming and turned into a monster. Johnny then begged the Crones to leave her be but they refused and wanted to punish Johnny for getting in their way, thus the monsters around his burrow. (50) Now return to the orphanage to tell the others what you found out, then make your way to the basement, whose door is located immediately to the right upon entering the building.
Pick a Doll[]
Climb down into the cellar and approach the altar and Graden will inform Geralt about magic involving the dolls with hair woven into them. However, it's ultimately up to you to pick one of the dolls:
Doll with Red Bead - Anna wears a string of beads like this currently, as well as ""half the women between Novigrad and Vengerberg""
Doll with Bird Feathers - reminds Geralt of Philippa Eilhart, has no immediate connection to Anna
Doll with Violet Hollyhock Bloom - the Baron mentioned that this was Anna's favorite flower
Doll with Human Ear - probably one of the peasant's as Anna still has both ears
The correct choice is the Hollyhock bloom doll and picking this one will lift the curse and Anna will become human again. However, the Crones played one last trick: the curse was tied to her life and by lifting it, she'll die soon. She remarks that she's glad to see both her daughter and husband together, Phillip apologizes for everything he's done, and Anna asks Tamara to remember her from a time where they were happy before she dies.
However, if the wrong doll is chosen, Anna, still as a grave hag, will burst into flames and die. Tamara becomes angry at this and yells at both Geralt and her father while Graden remarks he's sure it could have been solved another way.
Go back to Crow's Perch[]
Whichever way Anna died, you receive 300 and Philip will tell Geralt to collect his payment at Crow's Perch. When you return there however, as you approach the keep a cutscene will occur and Geralt sees that Phillip hanged himself from the tree in the courtyard. Afterwards, you get your 100  from Sergeant Ardal, ending the quest.
The aftermath[]
Regardless of how events transpired (and even if the quest is already completed), the Sergeant takes over command of the Baron's men and they become even more merciless towards the peasants. The first time you return to the village part of Crow's Perch, you can encounter them robbing an old peasant (near the main gate) and forcing themselves on a girl (at a hut on the eastern side). You can intervene to protect the peasants and earn 15 for each case.","Meet the baron in Downwarren.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Take_What_You_Want,Velen,"Head to the location north of Keira Metz's hut, where you'll find 3 bandits standing around the entrance to Gaetan's stash. Kill them off, then climb down into the hole where the chest is right there, containing 250 , Teigr, and a letter, completing the quest. However, you can also examine the trophies in the small alcove as well if you wish.",Go to the School of the Cat witcher's stash to collect your reward.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Reardon,Velen,"You can start this quest a few different ways:
meet Dolores Reardon as she's being kicked out of someone's hut in Lindenvale
find the notice on Lindenvale's notice board
find the manor while exploring
The rewards don't change here if you talk to Dolores first or not (as there's no way to haggle) but can save a trip of having to return to the manor if you talk to her first. She'll reveal she's returned to the area as her husband has passed away, but her family estate is infested with monsters. Agree to help and she'll give you a key to use to unlock a box at the manor as your reward.
The events that unfold at the manor are dependent entirely on whether you either spared or killed Letho during The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings.
If you chose to spare Letho, Geralt arrives at the manor to find that there are no monsters in the area. What he does find are traps around the area and someone hiding in the barn, activating the quest Ghosts of the Past. Note that the initial conversation with Letho here will change slightly if you managed to evade his traps or not.
If you killed Letho, there will be no traps and the estate is instead filled with wraiths, which Geralt has to kill.
Regardless of the above, once the wraiths are dealt with (whether by you or Letho), you get the objective to return to Dolores and this is all that's required to complete the quest. However, unless you came here before you met Dolores, remember that she gave you a key for a lockbox with your reward, and there's more  to be earned as well. Note: if you haven't talked to her already, that's fine - you can get all rewards even after the quest completes.
To find the lockbox, you'll first need to find a sturdy barn key, so enter the most northwest house and loot the chest in the corner for it. Then make your way to the main building and unlock the door here. You should immediately see red writing on a wall with your Witcher Senses. Examining it will uncover the lockbox just below it. If you talked to Dolores first, you can then unlock it here for 50  and 100 florens (otherwise you'll need to talk to her afterwards to get the key). There's also two more things you can examine in the other buildings, but aren't really needed - a painting of Dolores and her twin brother Humbert, as well as her diary.
However, if you want to earn more  and learn what happened to her brother, head outside to the back of the barn to find a hidden stairway that leads down into a cellar. Note that if you didn't kill all the wraiths, some will spawn here as well. Make your way to the furthest room in the cellar to find a weak wall and destroy it, then enter to find a skeleton you can examine and some paper nearby. With that, head back to Dolores at the Lindenvale tavern.
If you found and examined the skeleton, Geralt will automatically reveal this to her and, while she'll be sad knowing her husband killed her brother, she'll thank you nonetheless. Regardless of what you did so far, you get 25  here and the quest completes. However, if you fully investigated, you'll also get 80  and 50  for finding and revealing what happened to Humbert. Also note that if you found the manor first, this is when Dolores will give you the lockbox key.
While the quest may be finished, if you return to the manor later, you'll find Dolores has moved back home and can be talked to. If you didn't open the lockbox yet, she will remind you of it, and you can still do that and/or find the skeleton in the cellar. You still get all the optional rewards and can return to her for an update if you wish.","Ask Dolores about the monsters in her manor.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Truth_is_in_the_Stars,Velen,"You can start this quest by reading a posting on Oxenfurt's notice board or by visiting Benek. Look around the west side of the village to find an old sage sitting outside his hut and commenting how he'd been expecting you. Talk to him to learn he can see visions but unfortunately his seeing eye hasn't been as sharp in his elder years and asks you find dragonsroot if you really want to hear a strong vision from him. (10)
The root in question is southeast from the village, in a cave on the coast, guarded over by 4 ghouls. Once they're dead, use your Witcher Senses to find the root and once in hand, head back to the old sage and give it to him. He'll say some interesting things that relate to Ithlinne's Prophecy before finishing the quest.","Bring the fortune teller something to eat. (10)
Find dragonsroot using your Witcher Senses.
Take the dragonsroot to the fortune teller. (50)"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Whispering_Hillock,Velen,"Regardless how you start this quest, make your way to the Ancient Oak where a voice will start telling Geralt to stay away. If you approached the tree from the east, nearby wolves will attack and have to be killed. Head to the western side, at the base of the tree to find a werewolf guarding the entrance to a cave and an Igni Place of Power. If you're having trouble finding this entrance, follow the white dotted path marked on on your map.
The werewolf can either be left alone or killed before heading into the cave entrance, although the werewolf will try to attack Geralt if he comes too close to it. Upon entering the cave, you'll follow a small, partially flooded path (with a couple of worthwhile chests underwater), finally reaching the beating heart in the roots of the tree.
Once the heart is reached, you can talk to the spirit, whose dialogue choices will depend on how you started the quest. If you were sent as part of the main quest, there will be some interesting choices to talk to the spirit about the Crones as well as the orphans at Crookback Bog. Otherwise, you'll just have some basic dialogue about why the tree was killing those who got too close. But ultimately, you must then decide the fate of the spirit: release them or kill them. Only directly saying that you don't trust the spirit is irreversible, as you can still decide to kill it later if you change your mind. Note: Your choice here will have a major impact on Downwarren's villagers, the orphans in Crookback Bog, and the Bloody Baron's family.
Release the Spirit[]
If you agree to release it, the spirit will tell Geralt to gather 3 things: a raven feather, the spirit's bones, and lastly, a wild, black horse.
You may already have the raven feather, particularly if you already met Johnny. But if you don't, head west of Downwarren along the path until you reach a small broken bridge and you'll see some harpies and birds circling near the cliff over a nest. Once you've killed off the harpies, loot the nest for the feather and a sealed bottle.
For the remains, head out into the swamps between the Ancient Oak and The Orphans of Crookback Bog signposts, where a water hag is nearby and possibly some drowners as well. Go to the southern edge of the yellow search area and, using Witcher Senses, find the spirit's grave and interact to get the remains, to which Geralt will remark they don't appear human.
For the final part, the black horse, head out to where the objective marker is to find several of them. They'll naturally run if you get too close, but you just need to get close enough to use Axii on one of them. If you're having trouble and all the horses run out of the marked area, new ones will appear. Once you successfully subdued one, mount the horse and ride back to the cave where the spirit is and through the new opening that appeared when you left earlier. Once close enough to the spirit, a cutscene will trigger.
Geralt will then have 3 different choices: release the spirit, trick it to let it die, or kill it.
If you go through with releasing it, Geralt will then begin the ritual and the spirit will then transfer to the horse, becoming Black Beauty. If you are doing this as part of the main quest and asked it to save the orphans, Geralt can then ask about them to which the spirit promises to keep their end of the deal and will then run off. Otherwise, the spirit will simply remark they're free again and run off, finishing the quest.
If you choose to trick it, Geralt will start the ritual but then refuse to stab the heart, letting the spirit die without a fight, finishing the quest.
If you changed your mind completely and wish to kill it, a fight will break out like if you had chosen to kill it before gathering all the required items.
Fight the Spirit[]
If Geralt outright refused to help free the spirit, either after the first conversation or after they gathered all the items to initially release it, the spirit will summon endrega workers to protect it. They appear in waves and, as soon as one wave is finished, concentrate on attacking the branches around the heart, which will eventually give way so you can attack the heart directly. Once the spirit is dead, the quest will complete and, if you were doing it as part of the main quest, Ladies of the Wood will resume.","Find where the voice is coming from using your Witcher Senses.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Thou_Shalt_Not_Pass,Velen,"Both the Western Gate into Oxenfurt and the Border Post in Velen are closed and heavily guarded by Redanian troops because of the recent war. Until this quest is completed, you cannot use the main thoroughfares to traverse the Pontar. However, some slightly less orthodox methods are available such as swimming across the river at a safe distance from any border posts. Fast-traveling between signposts on opposing sides of the river is also allowed, even without the necessary papers.
It is preferable to start the quest at the Border Post, because you if ask the guard there how to obtain a pass, you can bribe him with 10  or use Axii (25, doesn't require Delusion) to get the information. Whether you asked or not though, there are 3 ways to obtain a pass and you may've even stumbled upon one of them already.
Note: after meeting with Gregor in A Deadly Plot, the guard at the Border Post will no longer offer you the bribe and Axii options for asking how to obtain a pass or allow you to complete this quest, so you must complete the quest at the Western Gate.
Official papers[]
Upon reaching a point of the main quest Family Matters where Geralt reports on Tamara's whereabouts to the Baron, he will require you to travel to Oxenfurt and provides a pass to help.
Completing Contract: Woodland Beast can also yield an official pass as a reward.
Fake papers[]
Journey to the refugee camp on the southern side of Border Post to find a shady merchant. He'll sell you a fake pass for 100  (50  with Axii) or 25  if you help his brother-in-law, Albin Hart, in Bitter Harvest. If his brother dies, the merchant will refuse to do business with you.
If you somehow managed to start A Deadly Plot without having any kind of papers, you'll also receive fake ones from Gregor on the other side of the Border Post.
Use the pass[]
Once you have whichever pass in hand, approach one of the border soldiers, show them your pass, and after a bit of banter, you're allowed through and the quest will conclude. (75) You can even use the fake pass at the Western Gate, though the guard there will note it's missing a seal, but wave it off as their people forgetting stuff like this.","Acquire a pass granting permission to cross the Pontar.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Where_the_Cat_and_Wolf_Play...,Velen,"After killing off the alghouls in the previous quest, Contract: The Beast of Honorton, you'll now need to investigate to see what happened to Honorton. You can examine the body the necrophages were eating, but won't learn much from it.
The nearest hut that the alghouls were outside of has a body, a stove, and a leshen's head that, if you had found the notice first, Geralt will remark someone beat him to the contract.
Next, go examine the barn, where 2 more bodies and a piece of wood can be examined. An alghoul however appears just inside, so kill it off to finish examining the interior, where a blood splatter indicates the injured person wasn't a mere peasant. Further in are a few more bodies and a pitchfork. As you exit the barn a couple more alghouls are approaching the village, so kill these off as well to continue investigating.
The other 2 huts have more bodies inside that can be examined, however you just need to examine the one with the dog corpse outside it for a short cutscene where a little girl is seen running off. Head just outside to find her doll and some footprints, which when followed into the other hut, show she ran right through one window and out the other.
Note: If you left the barn for last, the cutscene with the fleeing little girl will be triggered once you examine the corpses there.
Find the girl behind the large tree and use Axii (requires Delusion level 1 for a minimum of 30 ) or give her her doll. If you choose to give her the doll, you can give it right away or hold it until she tells you what happened. Regardless, she'll tell you everything. You can ask her to go on or say that's enough, though not needed to know anything else as it's now revealed a fellow witcher massacred the villagers but for some reason let her live. She'll then give you the medallion she found in the barn, indicating the fellow witcher is of the School of the Cat and earning 50 .
Head to the area Millie indicated to find a bloody handprint and footprints you can follow which will likely take you right through a pack of wolves. Kill them off and examine the blood before continuing and finally coming across Gaetan. You can talk to him to learn his side, or decide to kill him right away.
If you talk to him, he'll reveal the ealdorman offered a very paltry sum for killing the leshen and when he demanded the payment they had decided on earlier, they tricked and nearly killed Gaetan instead of paying him. You can then ask why he spared the girl if you want, before you decide what to do.
If you choose to spare him, you'll get 200  and access to the quest Take What You Want. Important: Do not start the next quest yet if you want to help Millie as it's proximity sensitive and will fail this quest otherwise.
If you choose to kill him however, note as a witcher he also makes use of signs, particularly quen. He'll also ask to use Swallow first to make it a fair fight. If you let him though, it'll turn out he'll try to blind you initially with a bomb instead. Once dead, you'll earn 200  and you can loot him for Teigr (you can get it via Take What You Want too) and Geralt will note he needs to get back to Millie (like above, do not go too far away as the quest will fail if you don't help her).
Whatever you chose, head back and talk to Millie and it'll cut to you arriving in Oreton to see her aunt. You can answer however you want, but the aunt will mention it may be better for you to take Millie as times are tough. No matter what you say though she'll take the girl in, though if you give her 40  (earning 4 ) the aunt will be nicer in her response to Millie. The quest will end there, but a few days later when you visit Oreton again, Millie will call out to you and, if interacted with, will thank you and give you a small gift.","Explore the village using your Witcher Senses.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_at_Heart,Velen,"This quest can be picked up from several Velen notice boards, including from Mulbrydale, Midcopse, Inn at the Crossroads, and Crow's Perch. You just need to obtain one to read to then find Niellen in Blackbough.
In Blackbough you'll find him standing in front of a hut talking to his sister-in-law, Margrit. Talk to him and agree to look for his wife and the two will give you several people to talk to and a location to check out.
There are a couple people Geralt can talk to: the butcher's wife and the blacksmith. In addition, the latter's children also give Geralt a bit more information about the morning Hanna disappeared.
Now head out to the marker in the woods to find more clues about Hanna's whereabouts. Eventually Geralt finds a pack of wolves gathered around a corpse. After they're dealt with, Margrit appears and attempts to bribe Geralt to lie to Niellen, saying she doesn't want to lose him and he deserves better than this. You can either accept the bribe or keep searching. If you accept, you'll earn 80  and 55 , the search field disappears, and the quest can be finished by talking to Niellen back in Blackbough. However, even if you agreed to lie to Niellen, as long as you don't go back to talk to him, the clues still linger and Geralt can still investigate despite telling Margrit otherwise.
Note: Accepting Margrit's offer and then continuing the investigation despite that is the most profitable route. However, this will create and subsequently fail a mission objective to tell Niellen that Hanna is dead.
If you wish to lie, head back to Niellen who'll offer you a reward. If you accept, you'll get 50  and 10 , otherwise if you refuse you'll just get 30 . Regardless, the quest will then conclude here.
Find the werewolf's lair[]
If you continue to investigate, examine the dog corpse then, slightly further away, a bloody mess that must be Hanna, which makes Geralt conclude it's the work of a werewolf. There are also claw marks around that should be clearly visible with Witcher Senses. Follow the trail of marks to a scratched stone leaning against a tree. Obviously you can't climb up there, so look for a tuft of fur nearby, just around the tree, although it can be hard to spot. That when examined will allow Geralt to follow the werewolf's scent.
Follow the trail which leads to some torn clothes and eventually to an isolated shack. While optional, you can enter the shack and pick up the mysterious notes and read them to learn some additional information. There's also a locked chest that you can come back for later. Once done, exit the shack and use Witcher Senses to follow a trail of blood to the werewolf's lair entrance, hidden underneath the shack, then use Aard on the door or break it with a weapon.
Note: You'll likely notice a Bear just north of the isolated shack. There's no requirement to fight it, but it may be hard to avoid as it tends to see Geralt from afar and moves toward the shack - if not at first, then when you exit the cave or when you enter the shack to loot the locked chest after killing the werewolf.
Fighting the werewolf[]
Once you enter the cave, or if you meditated/waited in the cave for nightfall, the werewolf and three weaker wolves will run in from the entrance. It's recommended to deal with the wolves separately or from a distance so the much stronger werewolf can be dealt with on its own.
The werewolf swiftly claws at you, dealing moderate damage, but his attacks are very aggressive. This is best returned with highly active and equally aggressive tactics, as he stuns you when attempting to parry or countering his hits. Thus, dodging and rolling works much better as a defensive tactic. It's also worth using fast strikes with the silver sword rather than attempting to set up heavy strikes or long chains of actions. Once the werewolf's health bar reaches half, with a howl he starts regenerating health. Take advantage of the howl as it leaves him vulnerable to a few heavy attacks. This is where you should make use of signs, potions, and bombs as switching to defensive tactics would only allow the werewolf to regain health. If you're having trouble and he's regenerating faster than you deal damage, one solid tactic is to drink a Tawny Owl, and then Axii him after a series of 3-4 fast attacks, then repeat.
A cutscene will interrupt the fight once the werewolf's health is low enough and Margrit runs in. No matter what you pick, you learn she knew Niellen was a werewolf for a long time and secretly loved him regardless. She then decided to show her sister what Niellen was, thinking Hanna would be disgusted and leave him. However, this plan backfired and Niellen slaughtered his own wife in a blind bloodlust. Enraged at this, Niellen threatens to kill Margrit for what she's done. You're then given a timed reaction to tell Margrit to leave so you can finish Niellen off, or let Niellen have his revenge.
If you allow Niellen to enact his revenge, the werewolf will slaughter Margrit without mercy, after which he returns to Geralt to ask for death and Geralt will oblige, killing Niellen without resistance. If you told Margrit to run, you'll need to finish killing Niellen. Whichever course is taken, the quest completes, earning 50 . You can also loot Niellen's body for his key which will open the locked chest in the isolated shack. Note: if you let Niellen have his revenge, he'll only have the key on his body. If you killed him by protecting Margrit, the key will be there along with some werewolf ingredients. Furthermore, if Margrit survived, you'll find her crying in the isolated shack.","Talk to the hunter named Niellen.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Witcher_Wannabe,Velen,"Note: After the prerequisite is fulfilled, the notice will appear on the notice boards of Crow's Perch, Oreton and Downwarren. Neither picking it up nor reading it will start the quest but it will instruct you on where to go.
Once the requirements are met, head to Lindenvale where, near the notice board, the ealdorman mutters about there being another witcher in the area. Talk to him to find out a supposed witcher took a contract for a monster and got his daughter pregnant. You can answer however you like before he eventually points you to the cemetery to search for the impostor.
At the cemetery you'll find he's hiding from a single ghoul. After the ghoul is slain, head to the back of the graveyard and the wannabe will thank Geralt for saving his life. However, two villagers appear to check why the supposed ""witcher"" took so long to kill the monster. When they see Geralt, a second witcher, they apparently grow suspicious of the wannabe's legitimacy. You can choose whether to expose the fraud or pretend it took two witchers.
If you expose him, you then have the choice of convincing them to let the wannabe go or let the elder decide (in which case he'll be killed). If you cover for him, you can choose between making him work for the elder for a year to make up for his failure or for him to never return to the village. Regardless of choice, the quest will complete, earning 10  for finding the impostor and 75  for completing the quest.","Find out more about the contract posted by the residents of Lindenvale.

Approach and talk to them and you can choose to just leave or suggest you can help them. If you respond to leave, one will recognize you as a witcher and say they need your help, going to the same options as if you said they could use your help directly. They'll then ask you to take care of the monsters within.
Important: after entering Carsten, the quest icon will soon disappear if you leave and a day has passed. If you return, you'll find that the monsters did break out and, while there are no bodies, the village is deserted.
If you agree to help them, they'll let you in but, to prevent whatever is inside from getting out, will bar you in until the monsters are dealt with. Inside you'll find 4 ghouls. Once you kill them off, the men will re-open the doors however, if you want to learn more, examine what the ghouls had been feasting on before you entered.
Once you've looked around, head back out and, if you examined the bodies, they'll tell you they were bandits. You can then tell them they should bury them or ask for your payment now. If you didn't examine the bodies though, they'll reward you all the same. Regardless if you looked around, they'll reward you with 25  and 20 , completing the quest.","Kill the ghouls.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Dangerous_Game,Novigrad,"After finally saving Dandelion go to Rosemary and Thyme, you will see Zoltan outside arguing with some suspicious men. Once you get close enough Geralt will join the conversation. Pick either option and the bandits' leader Duke will decide it's time to go, while his friend Earl will boldly declare he can get rid of Geralt, but Duke will insist it's time to go. After they leave Zoltan will tell you what is going on - apparently he started trading Gwent cards for a living and needs help getting 3 rare cards: Fringilla Vigo, Isengrim, and Natalis. Once you agree to help, Zoltan will direct you to Zed.
Zed and Isengrim Faoiltiarna[]
Go to Zed's place and knock on the door. No one answers, yet Geralt can clearly hear someone is inside and decides to look for another entrance. Walk back down the stairs and you should see a ladder in front of you, climb it and you should find another ladder nearby, so climb it too, then jump over a gap between the two buildings. Once you do there should be an open door there, so use it to get in Zed's house. Now jump down and you should find Zed's body lying on the floor, examine it and move on with the investigation. Walk down to find 2 bandits talking - they are looking for Zed's ledger, but can't find it. However, they have found the Isengrim Faoiltiarna card, so once the inevitable fight ends you will find it on one of their remains along with the key to the main entrance.
Now search for the ledger using your witcher senses. You will notice something like claw marks under the stairs, something heavy was being dragged there. Use Aard to break the boards and reveal a chest containing Ledger of Income and Outlays. Read it if you like, but regardless it's time to get back to Zoltan. Once you talk to him, your next targets will be Ravik who has the John Natalis card and Caesar Bilzen who has Fringilla Vigo, so you just have to decide where to go first.
Ravik and John Natalis[]
Go to The Golden Sturgeon and look for Ravik on the bottom floor. You find him cornered by Earl and the other thug you met at the beginning of the quest. Earl will offer to play Gwent with you for Ravik's life and the card. If you refuse, or agree but lose the game, Ravik is killed and the fight begins. If you win the game, Ravik is spared but the fight begins regardless. Once Geralt is done with the overconfident Earl and his lackey, Ravik will reluctantly give up the card if alive, or it will be found on his remains if he died.
Caesar Bilzen and Fringilla Vigo[]
Zoltan will aid you with Caesar Bilzen, so you will meet him when you reach the house. Once there, talk to Zoltan who will tell you his plan on how to steal the card. Apparently Caesar has some secret collection in his house and the card is part of it. Caesar will greet both at his doorstep and ask if Geralt is into fishing. Regardless what you answer, you will be invited to dinner and have a drunken conversation about fish. Eventually, Geralt will be asked to get more booze and you can go look for what you came.
Go upstairs and use witcher senses to find a knife on the sideboard and a triangular hole in the bookcase. Examine the knife so it turns to the side and a drawer will open to your right. Loot the drawer for a triangular key that fits the hole in the bookcase. When interacted, another bookcase will move and reveal a hidden door. Climb the staircase leading to the next floor where you will find the collection. There among other things you will find the card. Missable: In one of the cupboards you will find a Jade figurine which is the only way to start the secondary quest The Soldier Statuette, so be sure to grab the figurine as this is the only time to obtain it if you wish to do that quest later.
Once you have taken everything you want, go back downstairs and talk to Zoltan. As you're about to leave, two dwarves sent by Cleaver will appear with hostile intents for Caesar. You can choose to leave or fight them. If you fight them, Caesar will thank you and then decide to pack his things and leave the city, otherwise they probably kill him after you leave. But either way he never has the chance to deal with your theft.
Meeting the Client[]
Once you have all 3 cards, go with Zoltan to the place where the transaction will take place. Unfortunately, the client is dead and Duke has all the money. He will call in his thugs and make a run for it. Zoltan will tell you to chase Duke while he takes care of the thugs. Despite it being a chase, there doesn't appear to be any time limit here, so feel free to help Zoltan and then raid any containers you find along the way to Duke.
Go up the tower and some stairs and then down another tower to the last level, leading you to the sewers. You'll see Duke running behind a locked grate door, so you have to go around, but there's only one path available, so you can't get lost. Fight off a couple of drowners and find a breakable wall in the last room. Use Aard on it to progress, then kill off three more drowners before finding Duke lying injured on the ground. Talk to him and get the money back. You have the choice to kill him or let him go, though your choice is irrelevant as it's unlikely he will live. Now you will be teleported back to Zoltan who will give you another choice:
Take the gold (80 / 150 ), in which case Zoltan will find another client for the cards.
Keep the cards for yourself (no other rewards) and Zoltan pays off his debts with the gold.
The quest then completes.
Important: Keeping the cards may seem like the obviously better choice, unless you don't play gwent. However, they are later found on the Prison Warden during the main quest The Great Escape.","Get the Fringilla Vigo, Isengrim, and Natalis cards for Zoltan.

Follow your map to the Passiflora. It is just east of St. Gregory's Bridge. When you go inside, speak to Marquise Serenity and she will open a secret room for you. Head up the stairs and then speak to Dijkstra. Shortly after, Vernon Roche joins the two and Geralt can agree to help with tracking down the spies' missing contact.
Talk to the Redanian liaison[]
Meet with Gregor, the disillusioned Redanian soldier pointed out by Dijkstra. The easiest way to reach him is to fast travel from St. Gregory's Bridge to the Border Post nearby.
Find the shoemaker's wagon[]
The wagon is located southeast of the Border Post, southwest of Hindhold and north of Hanged Man's Tree, just east of the Person(s) in distress marker. After finding it, you will have to use Witcher Senses to investigate the area, but not before dispatching some low-level wolves and/or wargs. Mark the wagon on your map for later, and follow the trail of shoes southwest to find a rock troll, Rogg, standing over a pile of shoes.
Talk to the troll[]
Through the conversation with Rogg the troll you learn that he and his friends Ogg and Pogg have the shoemaker unharmed in their custody in a cave nearby.
Find the trolls' cave[]
The three trolls' hideout is just a few steps away. Walk into the cave and find Dijkstra's contact with the other two trolls. You can either threaten to kill the trolls to release him, or choose the second dialogue option which will reveal the possibility to have the contact released peacefully.
Witcher gear: Once you enter the cave, on the left along the main passage is a small room where you can pick up the superior ursine armor, gauntlets, trousers and boots diagrams, if you haven't already.
Kill the trolls (optional)[]
Both Ogg and Pogg will immediately turn hostile and attack if you threaten to kill them, and Rogg will join the fight a few seconds later, spawning behind you. This fight can be somewhat challenging even for high-level players, especially on higher difficulties, since the trolls will alternate between charging at Geralt and hurling rocks at him, leaving little room for attacks and maneuvers. It's recommended to keep Quen up all the time and, for lower-level players, to make use of Ogroid oil or, if available, its enhanced or superior variants.
Escort Thaler[]
Regardless of how you've dealt with the trolls, you now have to escort Thaler back to his wagon. Unfortunately, he will not match your pace, and will always walk instead of running or sprinting, so if you are impatient, you can simply head back to the wagon using the mark on your map made earlier - in older versions of the game, you'd have to wait for him there, but recent ones will just trigger the cutscene there as soon as you reach the wagon. During the walk, you have the option to talk with Thaler and ask him about his life since the last time he and Geralt met. Once Thaler reaches the wagon, he will thank you for the assistance and you can either leave right away or first ask him about his cover as a shoemaker and what he plans to do next.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Feast_for_Crows,Novigrad,"This quest may be started in Novigrad after Geralt's meeting with Cleaver in a shop near Hierarch Square. Taking the Gate of the Hierarch as a starting point, head into the city and follow the main path as it curves to the right around the Rosemary and Thyme/Chameleon. You will eventually sense the stench of decomposing, human flesh. Using Witcher Senses will reveal a scent leading a short distance off the path into a grassy area. Follow it, and you'll happen upon a man's corpse. Inspect the cadaver to begin the quest (See the image below if you are unable to locate the scent/body).
Inspecting the body will reveal that a sword wound was inflicted upon the man. Though shallow, it had severed an artery, and the man presumably bled to death shortly thereafter. Geralt will also automatically pick up a key from the corpse.
There are footprints and a trail of blood leading towards the scene. Inspecting them indicates that the man was running from his assailant. Backtrack along the trail, and you'll find that it leads to a building relatively close to the scene. Inside, you'll be greeted by a group of Cleaver's henchdwarves.
After Geralt's question concerning the blood trail, a masked dwarf recounts that he had a falling out with Derrick, the now-deceased, but later could not retrieve the corpse. However, the dwarf's companion, Grun, doesn't take as kindly to Geralt's intrusion, since Cleaver's orders entailed the killing of anyone who happens upon their den. The unnamed dwarf insists on taking a more diplomatic approach, as Cleaver ordered them to open a drop box with the key that Geralt is now in possession of. Thus, he offers an ultimatum – either Geralt receives money in exchange for the key, or a ""chib between the ribs"" should he make a fuss. There are two ways here in which to proceed:
Fine, take the key.
You give the bandits the key they so desperately desire in exchange for 20, and are transported out of the building as the quest ends.

Despite the landlady's complaining, he is allowed to enter. He walks up to the third floor to Triss's room. Approaching Triss, she asks him if they can have a chat. It seems that Triss has a problem.
Asking her about the problem, it is revealed that Triss received a letter from Lady Ingrid Vegelbud's servant. The letter states that the lady wants to help the mages escape from Novigrad by donating a tidy sum. However, in return, she needs a favor from Triss. As to what the favor is, it was not stated on the letter. Instead, she must meet with a servant. Considering the situation in Novigrad, where witches and mages are being hunted, Triss is hesitant if she'll meet with the servant, worried it may be a trap. Geralt offers to help Triss, stating he'll first talk to the servant on his own just in case it does turn out to be a trap.
Meet the Vegelbuds' servant at the fishmarket[]
Geralt must search the fish market to look for the servant who is wearing blue tunic and carrying a lot of keys on his belt. There may be a few people wearing blue shirt but using his witcher sense, he can easily find the servant if he spots his keys.
Upon talking to him, Geralt can tell him the passphrase. Although he is not what the servant is expecting, in the end he asks Geralt to follow him.
Following the servant, they are ambushed by a couple of bandits. Triss appears and tells them that one of the bandits is working for witch hunters. After asking the servant, the man tells them the reason of the discreet manner they contacted Triss is because Lady Vegelbud was afraid the witch hunters would follow her. It is also revealed that the lady's son, Albert Vegelbud has taken an interest in alchemy and Temple Guards know it. The guardsmen aren't that much of a problem though since they were bribed, but the witch hunters are on to Albert. Geralt and Triss then decide it's time for the young Vegelbud to 'disappear'.
They must get Albert outside the mansion discreetly first though. Fortunately, Lady Vegelbud already has a plan to get her son out without being noticed: a masquerade ball. Geralt and Triss are required to prepare, and Triss must have a fox mask for this. Triss tasks Geralt to visit the tailor shop owned by Elihal to buy the fox mask, he can also buy other masks and some elegant outfits he can use. Elegant outfit can be also obtained for free from madame Irina Renarde or earlier during Imperial Audience. Head back to Triss to give her the fox mask and continue with the quest.
Note: if the quest Carnal Sins still active and the player must go to the Vegelbud Estate, but has not reached yet, Triss will say that the ball is postponed and the quest will be in stand-by. The player must finish at least the part at Vegelbud Estate of Carnal Sins to continue.
The masquerade[]
Once everything is ready, Triss and Geralt head to the ball. Inside the estate, they must find Lady Vegelbud. The guard outside told them they would find the lady by searching for a parrot mask. (25)
Upon approaching the house, if you stick to the paved pathway on the left side, Triss is approached by a drunk man who mistakes her for a woman named Vivian. You can choose to either get into a fist fight with him or diffuse the situation. If you diffuse the situation, you will earn 25. Once the man is dealt with, you may continue your search for Lady Vegelbud. At the main courtyard gate, Triss bumps into one Moritz Diefenthel and offers him a way out of Novigrad, but he is hostile to her and refuses the offer. After that, just go through the door to the main courtyard.
Once inside, you can take your time and enjoy the ball before talking to Ingrid Vegelbud. Walk around and observe the drunken guests' antics, play gwent, loot the tables for food and bump into a few familiar characters:
Sigismund Dijkstra wearing a pig mask at the buffet table on the left side of the venue.
Morvran Voorhis wearing a lion mask, who is looking for a friend of his near the gwent table on the right side of the venue.
Maria Louisa La Valette wearing a bird mask and observing a showing of trained dogs in the gardens, far on the right side.
However, only the gwent competition and talking to Ingrid Vegelbud are important.
Gwent competition[]
Find the table to the right and speak to the croupier to enter. There are three rounds, with a card being awarded to the winner each round. There are 3 players you have to play against:
Vladimir de Cret who uses the Nilfgaardian deck
Gomo Seeling who uses the Scoia'tael deck
Marius Florin who uses the Monsters deck
Their decks aren't terribly strong, especially if you've been playing Gwent since the start of the game and gotten a number of unique cards. Watch out for Scorches (though you should be fine if you bait out the scorch). Each time you win, you will receive a card for your efforts.
Don't worry if you lose a match, there's no immediate penalty and you can keep playing each opponent until you win. When you win the tournament, you will receive the unique Dandelion (gwent card) and 50.
Important: If you do not end up beating all opponents in the competition, you will lose the ability to complete the Collect 'Em All quest, and its associated achievement.
Meeting Lady Vegelbud[]
You can find her to the left side of the stairs to the house and after some exceedingly polite small talk, she tells Geralt and Triss that her son is wearing a panther mask. Once you find Albert, while he is boasting loudly about his alchemy skills, he tells them that they must meet in the hedge maze once everyone is drunk and distracted by the fireworks.
Triss suggests that they should wait at a nice spot nearby and you go to sit on a bench. There, the two have a little chat and Triss quickly gets drunk and flirty. She runs off to another place and makes Geralt chase her around the garden maze, after which he catches her falling from a fountain edge and you have a timed option to kiss Triss just before the fireworks are lit.
Important: If you wish to romance Triss then you must kiss her, otherwise she will leave Geralt after completing the following quest no matter what you do.
Kiss or no kiss, they are interrupted by Albert Vegelbud and Triss quickly sobers up. He and Geralt switch masks as an added precaution. Triss and Albert leave the maze first, followed by Geralt after about 15 minutes. As expected, Geralt is ambushed by witch hunters thinking he's Albert and has a fist fight with them (50).
Note: Unlike other fist fights, you can use signs during this encounter.
Once they are defeated, he must get out of the maze and look for Albert and Triss in the stables. Arriving there Geralt finds that Triss and Albert are done preparing, and Triss hands him back his weapons. The group then rides off, which concludes the quest.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Tome_Entombed,Novigrad,"This quest can be a bit difficult to find, as it takes place deep in Novigrad sewers. You can either enter through a tunnel in the middle of The Bits, or, just past the Tretogor Gate signpost, enter the door in the archway's tower here, following the path to a room with ladders, climbing all the way down, and entering the sewers there. If you do the latter, head through the room's door into the sewers, then through the gated door in front of you, following the path and turning left when you see the next gate. Along the wall on the left just before the gated archway you should spy a weak wall, marking the way to the quest.
Alternatively, the weak wall can be encountered during the sewer section of A Dangerous Game, when Geralt is chasing Duke,
As you make your way into the ruins past two weak walls, you'll hear someone up ahead appearing to struggle with opening something. Approach and he'll reveal he's Professor Vairmont Jonne and on an academic mission, believing there's an elven manuscript in the sealed sarcophagus. If you agree to help him, Geralt will push the lid away to reveal a vampire sleeping inside. However, once the vampire learns it's not the right year yet he'll tell you to fuck off before closing the lid.
Despite this, the professor will insist on opening it again, as he didn't get a good chance to look for the manuscript inside. Even though you have the option to tell him to leave the vampire be, the quest will be stuck as unfinished: while it won't fail if you then leave, it'll just sit in your journal until you complete it by bugging the vampire again.
If you open the tomb once more, this time the vampire will become angry and morphs into his true form, a katakan, leaving you no choice but to fight and kill him. Once he's dead the professor will almost whimsically note how you didn't give him a chance to ask the vampire about the manuscript before shrugging it off and leaving, completing the quest for 50 . Some loot can be found up the stairs behind the coffin.","If you refuse to help at any point:
Return to Professor Vairmont if you want to help him with the sarcophagus.
Kill the vampire."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Walk_on_the_Waterfront,Novigrad,"Near the water wheel to the east of Novigrad Docks, you'll find a man being harassed by some bandits. If you don't intervene, the bandits will soon kill the man, and thus not able to do the quest.
Intervene and eventually the man, Ginter de Lavirac, will ask you to ""take a stroll"" with him, protecting him as he makes his way down the port. Note that backing out of the conversation at any point will mean not being able to continue the quest as Ginter will then leave.
If you agree, along the route the pair is attacked by several groups of bandits, with each group seeming to know who the man was, and that he would be coming that way. Important: you must keep Ginter alive during these fights. If he dies, the quest will fail.
Once Geralt accompanies the man to his destination, it is revealed that the man is a fisstech dealer who is meeting his supplier. Answer however you like to the gardener comment, and eventually it'll come down to you defending Ginter or not. If you agree, the suppliers will back off and agree to the stated price and Ginter will reward you with 50  and 10 . However, if you disagree and back out, the suppliers will kill Ginter but reward the same amount. Regardless, the quest will then complete.",Escort the nobleman.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Warm_Welcome,Novigrad,"Head along the road southwest from Wheat Fields, towards the riverbank to find several Redanian soldiers and some refugees arguing, as the refugees are trying to flee Velen to Novigrad. If you approach you can ask to let them through or agree with the soldier in that they need to leave.
If you ask for them to be let through, you have a few options:
pay 100  to let them through
use Axii (requires Delusion level 2, gives 35 )
threaten him (will result in fighting the 3 soldiers)
simply leave
As long as you help the refugees, you'll earn 25 , with the refugee telling you about a hero's tomb near Downwarren that's supposed to have treasure. The quest will then conclude here.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/An_Eye_for_an_Eye,Novigrad,"After interacting with Vernon Roche, he tells you Ves is being troublesome and asks for help in her going rogue. You can go with him straight away or meet him later at Hanged Man's Tree. Just down the road, in Mulbrydale, Ves starts an attack on the black ones.
Rush down to the village and help kill the Nilfgaardians, but more importantly save Ves as she can die here and that would fail the quest. She doesn't die as quickly as her health drops at first, but be sure to reach her as soon as possible, so that you have some control.
After the skirmish, Roche will berate Ves and they'll argue until they see one of the Nilfgaardians has survived, lying nearby. Roche wants to spare him while Ves states they need to kill him. Ultimately it comes down to Geralt's decision, so choose whichever path you wish. If you choose to kill him, Roche will finish him off despite being against it.","Meet Roche at his camp.
Meet Roche by Hanged Man's Tree.
Save Ves.
Kill all the Nilfgaardians. (50)"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Cabaret,Novigrad,"After rescuing Dandelion from the clutches of the Temple Guard, head to the Rosemary and Thyme and speak to him. Dandelion explains that he needs money to transform the Rosemary and Thyme into the cabaret that he's always dreamed of owning. He will send you to collect a prop sword from Madame Irina, the leader of the theatre troupe whom you have already met in the main story quest The Play's the Thing. Irina says she wants the sword back when you are done but you can ignore that as there is no way to give it back to her.
After collecting the sword, you're to meet Dandelion after dusk in front of Sophronia's house. He then explains his hare-brained plot into getting Sophronia to give him a loan, by pretending to be a valiant crime-fighter while Geralt poses as a brigand and threatens Sophronia, which the witcher begrudgingly goes along with. Dandelion gives Geralt a script with somewhat overly dramatic lines, which you may select, or safely ignore if you wish. You must then pretend-fight Dandelion with the prop sword, and either defeat him (25) or let him win (50). To let him win without taking damage, you can parry his blows. This choice has no bearing on the outcome except for Dandelion's immediate disposition towards Geralt. You can also run away, which has different dialogue but the same effect as Dandelion winning.
Note: If enemy upscaling is on it will affect Dandelion, making him a much tougher opponent than expected, especially if one wishes to humiliate him instead of following his plan.
You are then to wait until morning to meet Dandelion at the Rosemary and Thyme. Meditating inside the inn will trigger the cutscene automatically. When you arrive, you find Priscilla and a group of dwarves but no Dandelion. The dwarves are builders hired to renovate the Rosemary and Thyme and will ask Geralt which style the place should be renovated in (theatrical or boudoir). You may pick yourself, or let Priscilla choose, in which case she will decide randomly. Dandelion will be happiest if you pick theatrical. Priscilla then tells you that Dandelion is looking for their choreographer, Polly.
Dandelion can be found banging on the door of the choreographer's house. When you talk to him he explains that her fiancé won't let her work for him. You then have to find the key to the house and either beat up Hubio or make him listen to Dandelion. What you do affects whether Polly stays in a relationship with Hubio, but either way, she goes to the Rosemary and Thyme while Dandelion sends you off to collect some placards from a halfling named Rautlec. (50)
Go to the artist's house in Silverton, and you'll find it being robbed by bandits who explain he's in a lot of debt and they're debt collecting. No matter what you say, a fistfight starts, but it doesn't matter if you lose as they tell you where Rautlec is anyway - the races near Vegelbud Residence. When you find him there, he receives an offer from Count de Luverten to pay his debts if he wins one last bet. He can't give you the placards without resolving his predicament, so you have the following choices:
Offer to win the race for him
Pay his debt of 200  (20)
Leave him to his own devices, but give up on the placards as well
If you choose to race for him, winning the race yields 25, 80  and a Mastercrafted saddle. Losing only increases his debt as he bets on Geralt, in which case you'll have the option to pay 270  (27) or give up on him and the placards. Regardless, if you relieve Rautlec of his debts in any of the possible ways, an additional 25 is awarded and he goes off to get the placards.
You can finally return to the cabaret and it will have the new interior as decided when you last talked to Priscilla, and it is now named the ""Chameleon"". The quest then completes after some conversations with Dandelion (70 + 50), but a messenger brings news that Priscilla has been attacked and you go to the hospital, starting the quest Carnal Sins.","Meet Dandelion at the Rosemary and Thyme.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Carnal_Sins,Novigrad,"After talking to Dandelion in The Chameleon, a messenger from Vilmerius Hospital bursts through the door, informing you that Priscilla has been attacked. Dandelion asks you to accompany him to the hospital.
The Hospital[]
Upon arriving, Geralt and Dandelion find Priscilla in a terrible state, being tended to by the head doctor Joachim von Gratz. He discusses Priscilla's state, saying that she is critical, but expected to live; however she is not the first victim of this style of attack, as others were killed in similar fashion. He then mentions his idea of 'preventive medicine', suggesting that he and Geralt go to the morgue to see the previous victim's body.
The Sewers and The Morgue[]
Follow von Gratz through the sewers and fight off several drowners and a bilge hag. During the journey, Geralt and Joachim discuss how he tries to prevent attacks from happening in the first place. He also mentions that whilst he believes Priscilla is certain to survive, he fears for her singing voice.
At the morgue, you need to search for a dwarven carpenter's corpse, found in the nearest room after you climb the ladder, though Joachim leads you to the other one. When you do find it, a small cutscene will begin and you can then examine his body to find evidence of the killer's M.O. before you are interrupted by the coroner, Hubert Rejk. He and Joachim have history, and they are not fond of each other. Pay attention to the dialogue, as it provides a subtle clue. As the conversation ends, Nathaniel Pastodi enters and insists that you leave, while Hubert covers for you and then agrees to update you on any news. On the way out, Joachim mentions that the reverend used to be a torturer for the Eternal Fire before he was promoted to reverend. Joachim then leaves to attend to Priscilla while you go search for more clues.
You now have three places to investigate: the location where Priscilla was attacked, the site of the woodcarver's murder, and Eustace the corpse collector. These can be investigated in any order. It is important to note that once you have completed any two of the locations, approaching the third location will have a guard approach Geralt to tell him that there has been another murder and the coroner wants to speak to him as soon as possible. The entire quest is directed to provide a sense of urgency, but nothing hangs on this - you can investigate all three spots.
Investigate the site of Priscilla's attack[]
Upon arrival, you will see some peasants and a prostitute called Whistling Wendy who walks away from you if approached. Eventually, the gate you entered through is closed and the three peasants attack you in a fistfight. Knock them out and then speak to Wendy, who believed you may have been the killer and she wanted to avenge Priscilla. As you search for clues, the objective for this location will complete, but continue examining until you find that the killer jumped over a wall too high even for a witcher. There is also a Concerned Citizen's sermon attached to the wall. You can speak to Wendy again for an additional conversation choice and to let her know what happened. Then head for the next objective.
Investigate the site of the Woodcarver's murder[]
Approach the closed door and knock. A voice from the other side will question you and then the woodcarver's brother Gus Meyer will let you in. Speak to him and then search for clues in the yard. Another Concerned Citizen's sermon will be found in the area. After finding all of the clues outside, either ask Gus to let you into the workshop or just try to enter and he'll unlock it for Geralt. After investigating all of the clues in this area, you can speak to him again if you wish. An additional conversation choice will appear allowing Geralt to tell Gus what likely happened to his brother. If you don't have a new conversation choice, then there are still items to investigate. There is a very subtle clue here, particularly related to the blood stain, but Geralt will only mention it to himself and not while talking to the dwarf.
Speak with Eustace[]
Eustace is the corpse collector, who is rather blunt about his profession and disrespectful towards the corpses. You can loosen his tongue by either paying him 200  (20) or using Axii (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35), threatening won't achieve anything. However, he does reveal that inside the dwarf's body there was a note naming Priscilla as his next victim, which he kept to sell instead of providing it as evidence. You can choose to punch him or just walk away in disgust.
Return to the Coroner[]
Speak to the coroner (who is located virtually across the street from where you encounter Eustace) and you can ask some questions that raise some suspicions about Hubert, especially if you've paid attention so far. Then you can look over the body and Hubert will find a note indicating the next victim - Patricia Vegelbud. Head over to the Vegelbud Residence.
Note: at this point the side quest Race: The Great Erasmus Vegelbud Memorial Derby will be updated as it is suspended temporarily. It may be shown as a ""New Quest"" even if the flyer for the race had previously been obtained.
The Vegelbud Residence[]
When you are allowed in by the guard, Ingrid Vegelbud will welcome you and take you to her mother's room, whilst mentioning that Patricia has denounced the Eternal Fire faith. On entering her room, you find Patricia murdered and the killer fleeing. Chase him (ignore the hostile dogs), until the guards mistake you for the killer and you are forced to fight them. When you cut one down to almost dead, or, alternatively, let them nearly kill you, a cutscene will trigger and they lead you back into the house. Ingrid will then defend you and allow you to search Patricia's body, where you will find a note with the final victim - Sweet Nettie of Crippled Kate's.
Crippled Kate's[]
Enter the brothel and you'll be told that Sweet Nettie is on the top floor. When you burst into her room, you find her tied up, gagged and about to be tortured by Reverend Nathaniel. You can choose to immediately attack him or talk first. Hearing him out will reveal that while hе is sick and perverse, he is not the serial killer. You then realize that the coroner, Hubert, is the real murderer. Sweet Nettie will plead for your help, and you can choose to either kill Nathaniel (100), use Axii (requires Delusion level 3; 40) to make him leave, or leave him to his twisted desires. If you do not kill Nathaniel, you will miss the chance to loot the unique poker he is using to burn Sweet Nettie.
Important: if you kill Nathaniel without hearing him out first, you will not be able to find the real killer even if you know who he is.
The Warehouse[]
If you got the truth out of Nathaniel, head to the warehouse by the docks and find Hubert inside. After a bit of talk, Hubert will then reveal himself to be a vampire and will fight you in the form of a katakan. After defeating him (500), loot his corpse for Deargdeith and a katakan mutagen.
Return To The Hospital[]
Head back to the hospital. Priscilla is recovering and Joachim says that she will definitely survive and her voice isn't expected to be severely damaged. Dandelion thanks you and then says that for now, they will perform as him providing vocals and her playing the lute until her voice recovers. The quest will then end.","Talk to Dandelion.

Never Trust Children"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Fists_of_Fury:_Novigrad,Novigrad,"This quest may be started via its notice on Hierarch Square's notice board or simply encountering one of the spots where fist fights take place.
The first location is The Golden Sturgeon where you'll find Master Claytop. Talk to him to setup a match between you and Georgius 'Piledriver' Georg. Before you start the fight though, Claytop will pull you to the side and asks that you throw the match, and will pay you 80 , on top of doubling what you bet (meaning you could get a max. of 240 ). You'll also be able to net an extra 50  by throwing it.
If you agree and lose you'll be able to fight Georgius again for real. You can also simply decline and fight for the win (note that agreeing doesn't mean you have to lose either, you can choose to go back on your word). If you choose not to throw the fight, later you may be attacked in Novigrad by three Bandits saying ""We'll show you not to mess with Master Clayton!""
Regardless what you choose, once you defeat Georgius you'll earn 25 .
The other two opponents are simple fistfights:
Archibald O'Neill is located just inside Portside Gate's archway, in the small fenced in area
Iron Mortimer is located to the west of Southern Gate
Once you defeat all three, you'll be directed to Durden, out in Farcorners. Despite being told to fight after sundown, they'll be out there at any time of day to fight. Once Durden is defeated you'll earn 75  and double your bet, completing the quest.","Defeat Georgius Georg.
Defeat Archibald O'Neill.
Defeat Iron Mortimer.
Fight the Tailor for the Novigrad title."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Gwent:_Big_City_Players,Novigrad,"You can start this quest by picking up a notice from Harborside's notice board or directly challenging the first opponent, Vivaldi. The progression is entirely linear, with each opponent directing you to the next, with only a couple of caveats where, due to Dijkstra being involved in the main story, he may only be challenged between certain events.
Vivaldi awards the Vesemir card and directs to Marquise Serenity. She gives the Morvran Voorhis card and directs to Dijkstra, who in turn gives the Esterad Thyssen card and directs to the final player - a little-known Scoiatael merchant just outside of town. When he is defeated, he will give the powerful Ciri card.
There is only one catch - Dijkstra will be unreachable at the start of Final Preparations (even if you haven't talked to Triss yet), and if you choose to deal with him diplomatically during Blindingly Obvious, he will be further be unavailable to play with until after Reason of State ends, assuming that you side with him there. This effectively means that, if you want to play Dijkstra and not side with him during Reason of State, then you have to do it before The Isle of Mists.
In the event that Dijkstra dies before being defeated at gwent, the quest will auto-complete as soon as Geralt has to challenge him, and the game will act as if the match was played and won -  and his card are awarded, with a green objective mark. However, since he isn't there to direct Geralt to the Scoia'tael merchant, the elf is excluded from the quest and, he can be played independently from it to get the Ciri card, but no  will be awarded for winning the match.
When the quest completes, regardless of whether the Scoia'tael merchant was part of it, Francesca Findabair: The Beautiful is given as a final reward.","Win Vimme Vivaldi's unique card.
Win a unique card from the Marquise Serenity.
Win a unique card from Dijkstra.
Unless Dijkstra dies before winning his card:
Win a unique card from a member of the Scoia'tael band."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Gwent:_Playing_Innkeeps,Novigrad,"While the quest may be started from a notice at Oxenfurt's notice board, it's usually started by playing with the Inkeep at the Inn at the Crossroads, as he is encountered very early in the main story. Other than him, you must also challenge Stjepan at The Alchemy in Oxenfurt and Olivier at The Kingfisher in Novigrad.
Stjepan uses the Nilfgaardian deck and uses the Emhyr var Emreis: The White Flame leader card, rendering your leader's ability useless, so be aware of that. He also makes good use of the available spy, medic, and decoy cards in his deck. Defeating him will earn 25  and the Yennefer card.
The Innkeep at the Inn at the Crossroads also plays the Nilfgaardian deck and just like Stjepan, effectively uses spy and medic cards. However, he uses the Emhyr var Emreis: Emperor of Nilfgaard leader card. Defeating him will earn 25  and the Menno card.
Olivier uses the Monster deck and defeating him will earn the Tibor card. If Olivier died during Now or Never, his unique card will be located in the room next to the bar and the unnamed Innkeep, in a small lockbox over the cabinet. Obtaining his card in either fashion will earn 25 .
Obtaining all three cards will conclude the quest.","Win Stjepan's unique card.
Win a unique card from the innkeep at the Inn at the Crossroads.
If Olivier is still alive:
Win Olivier's unique card.
If Olivier is dead:
Find a unique card in the Kingfisher.

"https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Hey,_You_Wanna_Look_at_my_Stuff%3F",Novigrad,"In Silverton district, near the bottles-selling merchant you'll find a halfling calling out to you. If you talk to him, he'll reveal he has a bunch of mages' items for sale: apparently pilfered from the homes of those burned at the stake before the witch hunters could gather up the contraband.
Ask to see what else he has, and as he begins to tell you he suddenly looks scared and runs off, asking for you to not reveal why he was there. A moment later several witch hunters appear, asking why the halfling ran off when he saw them. You can cover for him (10) or turn him in.
Important: You have to agree to see the halfling's inventory and lie for him for the quest to start. If you don't, you won't be able to use him as a merchant later either.
If you covered for him, examine the item near where he was standing to pick up a scent trail, then follow it a short distance around to his hiding spot. He'll thank you for not ratting him out and offers a discount on his stuff, earning 25 and completing the quest.","Find the mysterious merchant using your Witcher Senses.
Search the area using your Witcher Senses."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Hidden_Messages_of_the_Nilfgaardian_Kind,Novigrad,"Head north along the road that's to the west of the Crooked house. As you near the archway just before the morgue location, you'll see two shady individuals, one standing guard and the other crouching. As you get close enough they'll finish whatever they were doing and leave and Geralt will make a small remark. Note that this interaction is very easy to miss as no marker shows up in the quest.
Head to the archway they were standing near and use your Witcher Senses to see a brick in the wall and interact with it to get a note left by spy. Read it to learn the next drop location is near Crippled Kate's, earning 10 .
Head to the brothel area where, in the archway just to the east, you'll find another hidden brick and message, this time with a key. Read it for the final location (earning another 10 ).
Head to the Gildorf district, near the well, and open up the grate to head down into the sewers. As you head toward the search area here, three drowned dead will appear (one will be behind you). Once they're killed off, in the dead end hall you'll find the bodies of those who were trying to make the trade. Loot the locked chest to complete the quest, earning 25 . Inside you will find the final note, as well as 50  among other things.","Read the note. (10)

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/High_Stakes,Novigrad,"Read the notice on the notice board near St. Gregory's Bridge in Novigrad to begin the quest, then head to the Passiflora and speak to the scribe to enter the tournament. You will not be allowed to continue if you don't have enough cards in your deck and pay a 1,000  entry fee (earning 100). Once you do, the Passiflora is cleared of its regular guests and Geralt has an opportunity to speak with some of the other tournament participants. Notably, Sasha will approach and tell you who else to chat up before the tournament begins.
Tournament Tips[]
First thing you should know is that there are no rules against changing your deck during the tournament, so you are free to play a different deck each round, including the Skellige Gwent deck if you have it. As a result, you are free to use any and all strategies against every opponent.
Bernard Tulle[]
He uses the Northern Realms Gwent deck and ironically uses Foltest: The Steel-Forged as the leader card, it's ironic because the card is most effective against the Northern Realms deck, as it relies the most on siege cards and this card causes the scorch effect on the opponents siege units when activated. So if you favor the Northern Realms deck yourself this may turn out to be a tough game for you, especially if you rely on Foltest: The Siegemaster.
If you have the Hearts of Stone expansion, then you can play Foltest: Son of Medell to make the game more even. A good idea is to play a dupe strategy by using your Catapult as a shield instead of primary source of strength points, then if it is destroyed with a scorch effect play the other one in order to protect your remaining siege units. Another strategy is to rely on all your rows rather than just siege.
Alternatively you can play the Nilfgaardian Empire Gwent deck. In most cases it will work better as, while Northern Realms is strong, it is very susceptible to scorch effects and can only have up to 2 medic cards, while Nilfgaardian Empire can have up to 5. Thus you can easily overwhelm him by being able to draw more cards by reusing his and your own spy cards.
Sasha[]
Sasha is easily the toughest opponent in the tournament, if not the entire game. She plays the Nilfgaardian Empire deck and she relies heavily on spy cards, using her decoys and medics to use them as much as possible, though she has no weather cards. Her leader card is Emhyr var Emreis: The Relentless which she will use to draw a spy card from your discard pile as well. Thus, if you have a medic and have the first move in a next round, it's best to use it immediately and beat her to that.
The best idea is to beat her at her own game and play Nilfgaardian Empire deck as well. Select Emhyr var Emreis: The White Flame as your leader card, as that will disable her own leader card thus evening the playing field. Your deck should also contain exactly 34 cards, as if you maxed out your own decoys and medics to reuse spy cards you will be able to draw up to 24 more cards during the match - 8 for the 4 spies you can play, 6 for the 3 decoys and 10 more for 5 medics.
Hearts of Stone expansion strategy:
For this strategy you will be playing the Monsters Gwent deck and you must have the Eredin Bréacc Glas: The Treacherous as your leader card. This card doubles the strength of all spy cards, however, this effect can be doubled further using a Commander's Horn. This uses her spy strategy against her, as when she plays all 3 of her spies with a Commander's Horn on your close combat row it will give you 80 strength points, while also protecting your muster cards against her scorch effects.
Pack your deck with all your Muster cards, all 3 Commander's Horns, Dandelion (if you draw him, play him in the first round as he may get carried over to the next round), all 3 scorch cards (if you have the Blood and Wine expansion too you can instead use Skellige Storm if you already have them). Then remove your decoys as you will not be using them to reuse her spies. Other cards you should be using are the Kayran, the Olgierd von Everec card, and the Mysterious Elf card. However, be sure to use it after you have played all the muster cards you managed to draw, so you don't draw duplicates.
As soon as the round starts play a Commander's Horn in the close combat row, then play your Vampire muster cards, unless Sasha already played a spy, then you can choose another set as the spy will protect it from scorch effects. Beware as Sasha may attempt to scorch the Dandelion card, so make sure there's a higher value on the board before you play him.
Finneas and Count Tybalt[]
Neither requires any refined strategy to beat. Finneas plays the Scoia'tael Gwent deck, while Count Tybalt plays the Monsters Gwent deck but is rather inept.
The tournament[]
Geralt's first opponent is Bernard Tulle, who uses a Northern Realms deck. Defeating him yields 25 and his Foltest: The Steel-Forged (gwent card).
Regardless of whether Geralt wins or loses his match with Tulle, Sasha will approach Geralt after the match with a proposal. If you agree to hear her out, she will suggest that you work together to get the prize money. She does not provide any details regarding her plan, and instead only tells him that he should stay until the end of the tournament. Geralt should agree for the best results, and the tournament will resume.
Important: You have to at least hear Sasha's proposal for the best outcome of the quest. If you don't, the last portion of the quest won't be available and it will also fail if you lose any of the matches (or have already lost to Tulle).
If you defeated Tulle, your next opponent will be Sasha, but if you declined her offer and you lose, the quest will fail. If you defeat her, you'll get 50, her Emhyr var Emreis: The Relentless (gwent card) and you will move immediately to the next round, where you will face ​​​​​​Finneas, who uses a Scoia'tael deck.
If you beat him, you get another 50 and his Francesca Findabair: Queen of Dol Blathanna (gwent card). However, he will be enraged and start a fistfight. Knock him out before you can move on to the final round of the tournament.
Note: There is no opportunity to manually save your game in between these two opponents, however, the game does generate an autosave. The most recent one will be immediately before the fist fight, so be prepared when it loads.
Your final opponent will be Count Tybalt, who uses a strong Monster deck, as well as Torrential Rain (siege row). Defeating him awards 80 and his Eredin: Bringer of Death (gwent card).
To Catch a Thief[]
When the final match ends, regardless of who wins, the scribe will announce that the prize money has been stolen. Sasha assures Geralt that she was not the thief, and that they should work together to reclaim the prize money. At this stage, if Geralt does not accept the proposal, the quest will end. However, it only successfully completes if you won all matches.
If Geralt accepts, she talks their way past the guard and up to the second floor where you have to investigate. Use your witcher senses to inspect the crime scene—a body, a trail leading outside, and then a crossbow bolt on the right-hand side of the terrace (this can be hard to spot). Head outside to look for more clues and follow the strange scent to a crate on the road. Sasha recognizes the guild seal on the on the crate and tells Geralt to meet her at a warehouse on the docks. (50)
Once at the warehouse, Sasha tells Geralt that the door is locked. Go to the back of the warehouse to find another way in. Along the way, Geralt will spot the wagon used by the thieves and note that it has the same scent.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_Among_Thieves,Novigrad,"After clearing the casino of Whoreson Junior's men during the main quest Get Junior, Geralt finds a beaten halfling spy named Rico Meiersdorf sent by Francis Bedlam, the King of Beggars, in the top floor. If the witcher let Rico go, he will promise that his boss, the King of Beggars, will reward him. Geralt can then head back to Putrid Grove during Get Junior to claim a free reward from Francis Bedlam. The King of the Beggars then gives you Freya's Warriors' armor and Eirlithrad.",Collect a reward from the King of Beggars for freeing Rico.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Karmic_Justice,Novigrad,"Head to the alley just north of the dye pits in Farcorners to find three elves surrounding a human merchant. Note: if you wait too long to talk to the group, the elves will make good on their word and kill the merchant, and you won't be able to attack them.
If you talk to them they'll tell you the merchant sold poisoned fisstech to their young ones, causing them to suffer a painful death, and now they've come for revenge. However the merchant will claim they're just trying to rob him.
You can ask about searching the merchant to check if he has fisstech, but the elves will state they couldn't find anything because he's already sold it all. The merchant will deny the accusations and plead for Geralt to help him. Unfortunately that's the extent of the investigation: you must now decide to help the merchant or let the elves kill him.
If you help the merchant, you'll have to fight and kill the three elves. Note: during this fight the merchant can die. If you want a small reward, make sure he lives. Once all the elves are dead and if the merchant survived, he'll thank you, giving you 50  and 25 .
If you instead let the elves kill him, you won't gain anything from the outcome other than the elves thanking you for letting them carry out justice.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Little_Red_(quest),Novigrad,"Head to Yantra where, just on the western edge of the village you'll find a group gathered about, saying they'll protect one man among them. Talk to them and they'll reveal a bandit named Little Red and her gang wish to attack the village soon. You can ask them more on this and they'll reveal Bertram went and told the witch hunters about her group, and the hunters attacked her gang. However, she found out about Bertram's involvement and now wants revenge.
You can then agree to help or leave them to their own devices. If you agree, they'll run off to their huts to wait until it's all clear and you'll have to wait until dusk (7pm or later) for the bandits to appear.
Once the proper time arrives, you'll see the bandits knocking on doors calling for Bertram to come out. However, unlike most they're neutral to you and won't attack while they look for their target. You also can't immediately attack them, but must talk to Little Red instead, who's standing to the side.
Important: After the bandits appear, you can't stray too far away, otherwise the quest will fail. Note if it's already evening, they can appear immediately after you talk to Bertram, so it is best to discover this quest during the day unless you intend to complete it immediately.
Talk to her and, if you ask her why she wants Bertram specifically, she'll reveal that the peasant came to her with a deal half a year ago: he'd point out who's worth robbing and they'd give him a percentage of the spoils. However he got greedy, wanting more of the cut, and when Little Red refused he went to the witch hunters, who killed half her men. You now have two choices: stand aside or kill her.
If you stand aside, as promised she'll just kill Bertram, rewarding you 25  and 20 , before she and her gang leave.
If you refuse to stand aside, she'll force you to fight her, and reveals herself to be a werewolf. Important: if you haven't already, it's best to turn on manual sword drawing for this fight, as Geralt will draw the steel sword rather than silver. As she's obviously the bigger threat at lower levels, switch to silver and kill her off quickly, doing your best to dodge or incapacitate her men in other ways (like using bombs or signs). Afterwards, remember to turn manual sword fighting off unless you prefer it on. If instead you find the bandits more troublesome than the werewolf, you won't need to bother changing this setting.
Once Little Red and her men are killed, Bertram will thank you and give a lame excuse why he didn't tell you she was a werewolf. You'll then earn 50  and 10 , completing the quest.
Note that you can't reveal Bertram's role in the robberies to the villagers, whether you save him or not.","Wait until dusk for Little Red's band to attack.
Defend the villagers."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Message_from_an_Old_Friend,Novigrad,"Go talk to Marcus T.K. Hodgson inside his bookstore just off Hierarch Square and he'll immediately tell you a red book was left with him years ago to one day be given to the witcher Geralt, but he can't remember where he placed it, so you'll have to look around for it.
There aren't that many books here, and all of them are unique for this quest so feel free to pick them all up to read:
Moribundia: The Vampire's Last Likeness
Tyromancy, or the Noble Art of Cheese Divination
The Merry Adventures of Muriel the Lovely Harlot, Illustrated Edition
The Treatment of Furuncles Through Cauterization: A Study
My Manifesto - The Life of Jacques de Aldersberg
However, it is only the last one that you need and it is upstairs, just before the third floor stairs. On picking it up, a letter inside of the book will also automatically be added to the inventory. Once you read this letter the quest will complete, earning 50  and 51 .","Find a book with a red cover using your Witcher Senses.
Read the letter you found inside the book ""My Manifesto."""
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Novigrad_Hospitality,Novigrad,"On the road just west of Yantra, you'll find two bards, Victor and Gascoigne, talking about art. You can interact with them and they'll invite you to sit down and drink with them. You can either choose not to or join them. If you leave, that'll be the end and the quest will never appear in the journal.
If you join them, time will fast forward to night where the trio are noticeably drunk. You can choose to leave now or partake in one more drink. Leaving now will, once again, be the end of the interactions with no journal entry.
If you do one more, time will fast forward to daytime and you find yourself without any of your possessions save your trousers. You can examine the bottles but you really just need to examine and follow the tracks a short distance away to Yantra to find the bards behind one of the huts, discussing selling your stuff.
Approach and they'll beg for forgiveness. You can either ask just for your stuff back or demand both your stuff and theirs. Regardless of choice, the quest will finish, netting 10 , though if you ask for their stuff they'll be stripped down to their pants and you'll have received bards' belongings that you can sell.","Track down the bards using your Witcher Senses and recover your equipment.

"https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Novigrad,_Closed_City",Novigrad,"This is a two-part quest, with multiple phases that can be triggered and completed independently in any order, but are all connected and share a journal entry. In recent versions of the game, the two main parts will show as separate quests: ""Novigrad, Closed City"" and ""Novigrad, Closed City II"", or parts I and II respectively.
Part I (Lussi, Wallter and Fritz)[]
While walking around Novigrad, Geralt can encounter either of the three people involved.
Lussi[]
In the upper middle of St. Gregory's Bridge towards Temple Isle, a woman named Lussi calls over and asks for help, explaining that her home is haunted. Geralt follows her to her home, which turns out to be a ransacked house with two witch hunters waiting in ambush whom the witcher has to fight. After they are dealt with, Geralt confronts the woman for leading him into a trap, and to make it up to him she gives a key to a treasure.
At this point, the quest won't have more objectives unless Geralt already knows what to do with the key. To learn that, loot the witch hunters' corpses and read the warrant found on them, which will mark on the map where to find Lussi's partners for two more keys.
Wallter[]
Wallter is found screaming for help, banging on a door in the alley behind (north of) Crippled Kate's, and two witch hunters are closing in behind him. Geralt can either intervene and kill the witch hunters before they get to Wallter, or leave them to kill him. If he is saved, Wallter will give Geralt his key himself, while otherwise it can be looted off his remains.
Similarly to the part with Lussi however, the witch hunters must be killed for the warrant to provide info on what the key is used for, unless that's already known from earlier. If this is the first encounter, the quest won't even start before the warrant is read.
Fritz[]
While Fritz's house will be marked on the map, the marker is either bugged or otherwise not showing the exact house on purpose - it's the second one east of Triss' hideout (the door to enter Fritz's house is tucked between two houses, up some stairs). Inside Geralt will find a corpse, presumably Fritz killed by witch hunters. If you go the second floor, light the torch beside the stairs and it will open a secret compartment. Inside the compartment is a letter, Fritz's key and the locked safe that requires all 3 keys to open. If this is the first location that Geralt has been to, the letter will tell everything that needs to be done.
The quest, or this first part of it, completes when Geralt has all 3 keys and unlocks the safe with a nice treasure for his trouble.
Part II (Bandits)[]
Northwest of The Golden Sturgeon, between the Silverton fish market and a house with a large flower garden, Geralt will be called over by some bandits. They ask for help in finding their ""companion"" who was last seen coming out the sewers and heading towards the harbor. If agreed to help them, Geralt has to follow boot prints, the scent of sewer slime, and blood, while the three bandits follow him.
Note: Once the quest is accepted, it must be completed immediately or it will fail if you leave the marked zone at any point. The trail begins near the edge of the marked area on the mini-map and you must not stray away from it.
The trail eventually leads to a witch hunter near a gate southwest of the St. Gregory's Bridge signpost, whom the bandits were actually trying to find for burning their fisstech. You then have to choose between leaving the witch hunter to his demise or help him and kill the bandits.
If you leave the witch hunter in the hands of the bandits, 100 orens will be awarded (without notification), the bandits are seen going towards him and that's the last you see of all of them, completing the quest. If you kill the bandits, the witch hunter will then ask if you'd be willing to get him medical attention and, if you agree, you will be transported to Vilmerius Hospital where he will stay. If you refuse, Geralt will leave him for dead, while sarcastically remarking that the hunter would die as a martyr for the Eternal Fire. Either way, the quest ends here and there are no rewards in this case, except the minor loot dropped by the bandits.","Part I (Lussi, Wallter, Fritz):
Enter the woman's home and get rid of the danger.
Defeat the guards.
Find the other partners mentioned in the note and look for keys. 3/3
Use the three keys to open the safe.
Part II (Bandits):
Track the smell of blood and sewer muck using your Witcher Senses.
Follow the missing man's trail using your Witcher Senses.
Kill the bandits."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Now_or_Never,Novigrad,"This quest may be started by talking to Triss after completing A Favor for Radovid and A Matter of Life and Death. If they aren't completed in that order, a perfumed letter will be delivered to Geralt, urging him to visit the sorceress.
Before doing so, there is one related event that is only available before talking to Triss. On the bridge at Glory Gate, Geralt can find Moritz Diefenthel (the masked mage who Triss ran into at the ball) about to be burned alive by witch hunters. You can choose to let him burn or save him (use Aard and then kill the guards), after which he can be told to seek Triss for help and if so, he can later be seen during the quest. Note: Prior to Patch 4.0, Moritz could often be bugged and invisible until after you saved him, so this was easy to miss. If having trouble with this, just look for the pyre itself, it is very noticeable.
Meet Triss[]
When Geralt arrives at Triss' apartment, there are two temple guards and a witch hunter outside. Prior to Patch 4.0, Geralt could interact with them and if he tells them to mind their manners, they will become hostile. If Geralt chooses the other dialogue option, they will allow him to leave.
When Geralt enters the apartment, Triss is being hassled by the homeowners who sheltered her, demanding she give them her necklace as pay since the risk for sheltering a mage has increased dramatically. Geralt can either choose to step in, or do nothing. Afterwards Triss explains to Geralt that she's in a bind: she has to evacuate the mages as soon as possible, but two of them haven't reported in and she is worried they have been turned in. Triss must either risk everybody to try and save the two, or leave them to a certain death. Geralt can make the choice here by advising Triss on the matter.
Follow Triss[]
If Geralt did not kill the guards prior to entering of Triss' apartment, the guards will ambush the pair as they exit the building. After the fight is over, Geralt and Triss continue on, but must stop and wait for a patrol to pass before continuing on, otherwise more witch hunters have to be dealt with. If he chose not to save Berthold and Anisse, then Geralt and Triss head straight for The Kingfisher Inn, where Olivier will let them into the basement. If Geralt chose to save the two, he and Triss head to the couple's hideout, where they have to defeat the witch hunters before they kill the mages, earning 200 if both mages survive or, oddly 300 if only one survives. After the fight, if both mages survived, Geralt will have to use Axii on Berthold to convince him to come to the inn (25 even without Delusion). On the way out, the couple's landlords downstairs can optionally be talked to. However, due to the time spent rescuing the mages, Geralt and Triss will arrive too late at the inn and Olivier will die. Regardless of the innkeeper's fate, 200 is awarded for helping Triss reach the Kingfisher.
Enter the mages' hideout and follow Triss[]
Mages and the like have gathered here, ready to go to the port through the sewers. Sigismind Dijkstra is there as well, not to flee Novigrad, but to help the mages on their way, and at the same time to assure he'll have some friends and allies amongst them once they reach safety. Triss makes a speech to rally the mages before outlining the plan for escape.
Note: If Geralt completed Witch Hunter Raids and rescued Moritz Diefenthel from the pyre at Glory Gate, he and Remi will also appear in Triss' speech.
Find a path through the sewers[]
Geralt and Triss must then clear a safe path through the sewers so the others can follow their trail and reach the ship. After killing several mucknixers along the way, Geralt comes to a wall that can be opened using Aard, revealing an ancient library. Multiple rare books can be found in it, but to progress the quest, another wall on the opposite end must be broken. Geralt and Triss then kill more mucknixers and several swarms of rats before finding corpses. Investigating these leads Geralt to conclude that a katakan is lurking nearby. Triss provides support, but Geralt still needs to beware of this vampire's regenerative abilities. After eliminating it (500), Geralt and Triss make their way to the the docks (200).
Meet Dijkstra at the port[]
On the docks, Dijkstra starts a conversation, only to be interrupted by several witch hunters who must be defeated (300). Triss starts to say farewell and Geralt is left with a choice. If he says farewell to Triss, then she boards the ship and leaves with the mages. Dijkstra then offers to tell about his romance with a sorceress. If Geralt asks Triss to stay and tells Triss he loves her after romancing her during the previous quest, she comes back as Dijkstra is talking. Geralt and Triss then escape to a lighthouse for a private moment together (300).
Note: If Geralt has already romanced Yennefer in The Last Wish, he will lose them both if he romances Triss in this quest, or if he subsequently romances Yennefer after committing to Triss here.","If A Favor for Radovid is completed after A Matter of Life and Death:
Read the mysterious perfumed letter.
Meet Triss.
If agreed to help Triss:
Kill the Eternal Fire guardsmen.
If chosen to save Berthold and Anisse:
Follow Triss to Berthold and Anisse's hideout.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Of_Dairy_and_Darkness,Novigrad,"This quest can be started 2 ways:
find Aeramas' Abandoned Manor
find the Gildorf district shop and buy the related quest item there
If you found the manor first, you can explore the residence if you wish, but won't be able to activate the portal to continue. Instead, you'll need to head to the shop in Novigrad to get the related quest item.
At the shop, the merchant sells a number of quest related items, but the only one you need for this is the lizard figurine (40 ). Buy it, then head to the manor east of Oxenfurt.
If you didn't already find the manor, you can look around a bit, finding the deceased mage's notes on the second floor, along with a lever that'll make everything dark for a small duration. Witcher gear: a chest on the second floor contains Diagram: Enhanced Feline armor. Once done, examine the magic circle on the main floor then activate the portal to find Aeramas' secret laboratory. Note you can leave and re-enter anytime, simply activate the portals where you entered to leave/return.
As you enter the main chamber, Geralt will remark that Aeramas' must have been a tyromancer, explaining the smell and all the cheese statues. You'll see below what is essentially a maze: however unlike other gases, you can't use Aard or Igni on the toxic cheese fumes here. That said, it's pretty easy to navigate it to the other side. Follow the cheese pieces that have a glass case above them, the ones without glass are toxic, earning 50  as you go.
Make your way through the stinky cheese maze until you reach some broken stairs, then climb up. Make your way to the next room on the higher level and interact with the floor tiles to activate another portal to another location. Head all the way down to the water, then jump in and take the northern passage (there's no worthwhile loot down the other path). Continue following and climbing up ledges until you reach Aeramas' laboratory. However, as soon as you jump across the broken bridge, a foglet will attack if it spots you (otherwise you'll need to venture closer to it).
Once it's dead, head into the final part of the laboratory here and loot the bull figurine and Aeramas' notes off the desk. If you have The Eye of Nehaleni, use it on the nearby rock wall to uncover some more loot and possible random diagrams. Once ready, activate the portal near the fire brazier and enter to find the final room, earning another 50 .
The final room has a magical barrier that you'll need to deactivate before you can proceed. Cast Igni on both of the pyramid shape stones in the walls to the left and right of the barrier.
Note: Prior to Patch 4.0, you didn't need The Eye of Nehaleni to show the small pyramid on the left: you can simply hit the one already exposed on the right with Igni and the barrier will drop. However, with the patch, The Eye of Nehaleni is required as you will need to cast Igni on both the left and right pyramids to drop the barrier.
Once the barrier is down, loot the chest for 50  and the snake figurine (the last portal key), then take the sword, The Emmentaler, to complete the quest. (75) You can now exit the area through the final portal further behind the statue that had the sword.","If found the manor first:
Find out more about the run-down residence.
Use Aeramas' artifacts to activate the portal.
Search Aeramas' residence using your Witcher Senses.
Find a way to activate the portal.
Use Aeramas' artifacts to activate the portal.
Use the portal in Aeramas' residence.
Investigate Aeramas' dungeon.
Find a way to pass the tyromancy rooms. (50)
Find your way through the flooded chamber. (50)
Deactivate the magic barrier and get to Aeramas' treasure. (75)"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Of_Swords_and_Dumplings,Novigrad,"This quest can be picked up in a number of ways, usually by asking some blacksmiths if they know how to make master swords, or anyone who could, and all will point you to Éibhear Hattori in Novigrad. You can also pick this up by happening across his home there.
Head to his home and he'll be surprised to see a witcher and talk for a bit. You can choose to try the dumplings or not, but eventually the conversation will turn to looking for a master swordsmith and he'll show you his collection upstairs while filling you in on a long story: in short Ernst van Hoorn, another swordsmith, couldn't defeat others in skill so he instead managed to squeeze out the competition in other ways though debts, accusations, and cutting off supplies, and with Cleaver's gang backing Ernst, Hattori's appeal was denied. If you want Hattori's master level skills, you'll need to agree to help him negotiate with the King of Beggars' men to get supplies and he'll ask you to meet him at the docks around dusk.
Negotiating[]
Meet him at the spot on the docks (the earliest time is 8pm). Note: once he appears here, he'll wait for a pretty long in game time, well over a month. He'll also tend to stay here during that wait the entire time, however he won't have any interaction until dusk or later. If you get an update that he left the spot, just meet him back in his shop to try again.
Once you're close enough he'll approach and ask if you're ready. If ready, agree and follow him to the meeting spot, where Tinboy is waiting. Despite Hattori telling you that you guys need Tinboy's help more than he needs yours, they can be negotiated with. Tinboy will declare no negotiations, however you can do a few things:
Let's negotiate (will allow to negotiate down to 25%)
tell him he's crazy (will allow to negotiate down to 25%)
Fine. Let's get this over with. (stay at 50%)
The best deal you can get for Hattori is to negotiate (or by calling him crazy) then refuse to agree to a deal with any of the following options. When you reach the time reaction where Tinboy proceeds to leave, still choose ""no deal"" and Tinboy will come back, agreeing to 25% and a discount at the store. However, just as you agree, some of Cleaver's men show up. Kill them all off then follow Hattori through the door to the alley. Use Aard to destroy the crates he leads you to, and then continue on briefly to another location and cutscene.
Tinboy will make a good suggestion of getting protection until a truce is called, but regardless what you choose, you'll have to find your own protection for Hattori until a deal is made between the gang leaders. Meanwhile, Hattori panics and runs off. You'll earn 25  and 20  from this, but must now talk to Hattori to convince him to continue trying.
Getting a Bodyguard[]
Back at his house, knock on the door and he'll refuse to open up but eventually asks you to find him a bodyguard and no matter what you say, he'll suggest Sukrus, a Skelliger pirate. However, Hattori owes him money so he's hoping you can somehow convince Sukrus to forget that and help him out.
Head to The Golden Sturgeon where, on the outside of it to the east, you'll find Sukrus in a fistfight with a merchant. Intervene and he'll make you fight him. Regardless if you beat him up or lose, you'll both go in and have a drink where eventually he'll ask a favor for a favor, even if you have plenty of money to pay off any debts. With no other choice, he'll ask you to deal with his brother-in-law, either by convincing him to pay his debts back or smash the Skellige mead barrels.
Both options are at the same spot, on a ship off the main dock in Novigrad. However, the only way to convince the merchant is to use Axii (Delusion level 2, earns 35 ) otherwise you'll need to destroy the mead. If you choose to destroy it instead, use Aard on the pile of barrels on each side of the ship, but note as soon as you do the men will turn hostile. Once they're defeated, they'll run off and you can talk to Sukrus.
Regardless how you did it, Sukrus will be happy and, even after you reveal Hattori's name, will be glad to help you and act as bodyguard for Hattori, earning 10  and 10 .
Getting the Last Supplies[]
Head back to Hattori, who's now got protection, and talk to him and he'll thank you. However, he doesn't have another set of supplies (also being hoarded by van Hoorn) but suggests ""borrowing"" some of van Hoorn's, who's hoarded more than enough in a warehouse. You'll then earn 10  and 10  here. With that, go outside and talk to Sukrus, who'll ask you to meet him after dark at the warehouse, near The Golden Sturgeon.
You can meet him at 6pm at the earliest and he'll tell you the plan is for you to deal with the lone guard and mark the crates. As you approach you'll run into the brother-in-law again, who thinks you're following him around to antagonize him. The dwarf will recognize you from an old friend, Yarpen, and will let you in through the door using one of the following:
pay 200  (earns 20 )
use Axii (Delusion level 3, gives 40 )
Option to head straight in (only through an imported save if you sided with Iorveth in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings)
Once you do that, interact with the door to unlock it, then you can head in and use your Witcher Senses to locate and mark the 3 crates. Once done, head out to talk to Sukrus, only to find several bandits and Ernst van Hoorn himself outside with the brother-in-law. However, after van Hoorn threatens Sukrus, the brother-in-law sides with you and the three of you must take on van Hoorn and the bandits as, no matter what you say in the timed reaction, you'll have to fight.
Important: do not stray too far away during the fight, otherwise the quest will fail and there will be no way to get Hattori to craft master swords for you. Also note that you don't have to protect your allies: even if they get cut down in the fight, they'll survive. Afterwards van Hoorn won't be a problem anymore, the merchant and Sukrus are friends again, Hattori's got his supplies, and you need to go talk to him.
Return to Hattori, who's now back to forging swords, explaining with van Hoorn gone, Cleaver lost interest in swordsmiths, so now Hattori can work in peace and is thus now available as a master swordsmith.
Ask him about this and he'll tell you to come back later for your reward. Despite the quest not actually updating for this part, you can return in about 6 hours and he'll have the reward, Blade from the Bits, ready, completing the quest.","Talk to Hattori in his dumpling shop.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Out_On_Your_Arse!,Novigrad,"After Contract: Deadly Delights, head back to Crippled Kate's to find a crying strumpet outside and talk with her to learn some Skelliger warriors took over the brothel, throwing everyone out so they can drink and revel over a good raid they had. Agree to help and head in for a conversation with the warriors.
Important: this quest will fail after about a week in-game time if not completed. It will also fail if you back out of the talk with the warrior at any time.
Ask them to leave and you'll have up to 5 options to do that:
Challenge the warrior to a one-on-one fistfight
Threaten the whole group (will result in fistfighting all 3)
Use Axii (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35 )
Mention you killed the ice giant, scaring them away without a fight (only if you completed The Lord of Undvik)
say goodbye (will fail the quest)
Note that if you lose a fistfight here, the game will treat it like you died and you must load a previous save.
However you deal with the group, once they agree to leave go talk to the strumpet to let her know the good news and she'll be thrilled and give you a reward, which you can accept or decline. Note that regardless what you choose, you'll ultimately still get 25  and 15 .","Get rid of the drunk Skelligers.
Return to the woman. (25)"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Race:_The_Great_Erasmus_Vegelbud_Memorial_Derby,Novigrad,"This quest can only be picked up after doing most of Get Junior. An easy way to check is in the middle of Hierarch Square, where you'll find an announcer calling out about the race when it's available. Pick up an invitation to the Memorial Derby off the table near the announcer and read it to start the quest.
Out at the Vegelbud Residence, talk to the race master who'll let you race after you pay the fee of 100  to enter. You can also talk to him to learn a bit about the history of the races if you wish. Note: time will always skip ahead to certain designated times (not always 24 hours apart).
Note that all the races, while different routes, are quite long, so you'll need to keep an eye on Roach's stamina. You'll also need to pay 100  as your entry fee for each of the three races.
For the first two races, you'll earn 10  after you pay each fee and after each win you'll earn 10  and 160  (getting a total net value of 120  if you won both the first time). You'll also earn the Superior racing saddle from the first win and the Rugged saddlebags in the second.
The third race begins like the rest (100  to enter and get 10 ) and you'll be racing against Luc Vegelbud. Note that the weather will always be rainy here, and you'll need to make sure you follow the set path, as there's a ""Y"" split where neither path is blocked (as you eventually loop back and go the other way).
After you defeat Luc, you'll earn 25  and 200  along with the Superior cavalry saddle. However, as this was also the final race here, you'll also earn an additional 75  and 80 . You might notice though that the quest hasn't completed here. With that, head down the stairs and one of Cleaver's men will congratulate you before giving you a message from Cleaver. Read it, then head back to Novigrad to talk to the gang leader, who'll ask you to enter the Palio race as his entry. Important: once you agree it'll go straight to the race, so don't agree until you're ready and make sure you have a save prior, as you can only do this race once (so if you lose, that's final).
Prepare for a long race: you'll essentially be racing all across Grassy Knoll and then back to the starting point. If you lose, Cleaver will be annoyed but luckily won't do much else (though you don't get any rewards). If you win though he'll be delighted, giving you 700  on top of your race winnings: Racing horse blinders and 40 . Regardless if you won or lost though, the group is soon broken up by the temple guard, who're obviously not happy about all the ruckus. The quest will complete here and you can choose to run off without fighting any guards.","Talk to the master of ceremonies for the Vegelbuds' race.
If one takes a break between races:
Talk to the master of ceremonies to begin the race.
Beat the first rider.
Beat the second rider.
Beat Luc Vegelbud.
Read the letter you received.
Talk to Cleaver about the letter.
If you initially say no:
Return to Cleaver and talk to him about the race.
Be the first past the finish line."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Racists_of_Novigrad,Novigrad,"This quest is encountered in two parts, where generally the female elf has to be done first before the second part with the male elves will appear.
Female Elf[]
Head north from Portside Gate into Novigrad where, at the second intersection, you'll come across a couple townsmen harassing an elf. The men are convinced she's lying and up to something. You can ask why she doesn't tell the truth but she'll stay quiet. You then have two options: leave or defend her.
If you leave, the men will insult her once more before letting her go. If you defend her, the men will back off knowing you can easily kill them. Despite this, no matter what you say to the elf, she'll still be bitter and sarcastically responds to you before leaving.
Male Elves[]
Northeast of Tretogor Gate, where the dye pits are, you'll find some townsmen harassing some elves. You can choose to interfere and tell the humans to leave the elves alone, or go your own way. If you stand up for the elves you'll have to the kill the townsmen. Afterwards, you can warn the elves to leave Novigrad as eventually The Eternal Fire will come after them or simply say farewell. Regardless, they're annoyed with their limited choices but the quest will complete here.
Cutoff point: this encounter is unavoidable during the Contract: An Elusive Thief quest where you have to chase the Imp exactly near these elves. Stopping then to deal with them will fail the contract as the Imp gets away.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Reason_of_State,Novigrad,"At the end of Blindingly Obvious, Dijkstra tells the witcher to meet him by a warehouse near Novigrad Docks.
Important: the secondary quest Warehouse of Woe takes place immediately next door and if started, should be completed before continuing with Reason of State, since Warehouse of Woe will fail if you leave the area.
Once you enter, you will hear Dijkstra, Roche and Thaler conversing just above you. Joining the conversation, Dijkstra will reveal his plan on how to lure Radovid out using Philippa Eilhart as bait; the witcher may accept or decline the plan during dialogue. If he accepts, they plan to lure him to the bridge leading to Temple Isle. As the discussions finish, the screen will pan to an owl eavesdropping on the conversation.
When the witcher exits the warehouse, he is greeted by Philippa, who states that their plan would never work, as Radovid may be insane, but not stupid and wouldn't fall for empty words. She then gives the witcher Vizimir II's ring, to use as proof to get Radovid to believe Geralt and maybe even trust him completely.
To move ahead with the plan, go to Radovid's ship nearby and speak with the guard. Radovid is reluctant to believe it as many others have tried to give him false information about Philippa Eilhart's whereabouts, which he had dealt with brutally. Presented the ring though proves decisive and Radovid mobilizes his men to the bridge, taking the witcher with him.
Once there, Radovid orders his men to secure the bridge so that no one gets in or out, but then also orders Geralt killed while he is without his swords. Fortunately, Roche's ambush saves him and Geralt must now join the fight to defeat the Redanian soldiers and witch hunters on the bridge.
You'll only be handed a basic sword at first, but after the first few enemies you'll get your real equipment back too. There are a lot of enemies, but the Blue Stripes do an excellent job fighting them as well. Just be careful not to hit exploding barrels when you're near them and the rest should be easy enough.
Eventually, Radovid is cornered at the end of the bridge, but before you can get to him, Philippa appears out of a nearby house. She blinds Radovid with a powder and stabs in the back, killing him, then quickly morphs into an owl and vanishes. Geralt, Roche, and the Blue Stripes make a quick getaway before any more Redanian forces arrive. (25)
As the mission is completed, Roche, Ves, Thaler, and Geralt gather in the theatre to celebrate. Regardless of your dialogue choices, it is revealed that the assassins have been in peace talks with Nilfgaard and have negotiated a truce in which Temeria will become a vassal state to the empire, in exchange for Radovid's head and stop to guerilla activities.
Dijkstra, however, has other plans. Believing the price for both the truce and Temeria's restored sovereignty (which he considers questionable) too high, Dijkstra openly opposes Roche and Thaler's agreement. With Radovid dead, he plans to become Chancellor of Redania and continue the fight against Nilfgaard, and after the war's end unite the Northern Realms under his banner, including Temeria. Naturally, this doesn't sit well with the others, but they're surrounded by Dijkstra's men.
You now have a choice:
Walk away and let Roche, Ves, and Thaler be slaughtered, in which case Dijkstra will become Chancellor of Redania
Defend your comrades and kill Dijkstra and his men, leading to the agreed deal with Nilfgaard
The quest then completes.","Meet Dijkstra, Roche and Thaler in the portside warehouse.
Lure Radovid from his ship.
Kill Radovid. (25)
Follow Roche.
If Geralt protects the Temerian patriots:
Defeat Dijkstra and his men."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Redania%27s_Most_Wanted,Novigrad,"Go to Est Tayiar to meet the witch hunters. They will not be happy to see Geralt as they believe he will claim all the glory for himself after so many of them died trying to get in, but they will give him the plate key anyway. Head on down to find a forcefield and use your witcher senses to examine the wall to the right and place the plate there.
Note: You can also find a breakable wall there behind which you can find the Feline silver sword diagram for the Scavenger Hunt: Cat School Gear.
Continue forward to find 2 portals, the one to the left is open while the other is not, so use the left one. Inside you will find some nekker warriors (mislabeled as nekkers) and an inactive portal. Notice the power cell crystal nearby, if you examine it Geralt will mention that one of his signs may charge it, use Aard to do just that. Now that the portal is working, continue through it.
Courage above all[]
Once through you will meet a survivor, who will have another power cell, but refuses to give it up because he is too afraid of the monsters:
You can use Axii (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35 )
Knock some sense into him, in which case you need to fistfight him
Regardless once you have the power cell continue forward. If you look inside the chests you can find a Letter to Philippa. Now place the cell on the marked location and use Aard on it to open the next portal. After getting through, Geralt will be greeted by more Nekkers, kill them and go right to find another inactive portal. Geralt will remark that the nekkers may have the next power cell, so go back and take the path leading down. You will find a few more nekkers and the power cell there. Take it back to the portal and activate it like the previous. 70 is awarded once you go through the portal.
The Lair[]
Now you will be at the lowest level and encounter a Fire Elemental, so use your elementa oil and whatnot to get rid of it. Now enter through the gate at the far end to find Philippa's room, to the left you can find some agate. Search the rest of the room to find a broken megascope and a polished crystal. Note: The crystal doesn't glow with Witcher Senses, so it can be hard to spot - it's by the right-side column. Take it then go back to the last portal, however, there is no need to go back all the way, just go to the right and there will be another portal that is inactive. Use Aard on the nearby power cell to activate it and it will take you back to the beginning through the inactive portal that was to the right at the start.
The choice[]
Once you are back out the witch hunters will demand you give them the polished crystal. Agree and you get 50, but no payment from Radovid later. If you refuse, you will have to fight them. If you chose the latter, you can bring it back to Radovid, or if Triss and/or Yennefer are available you can bring it to them. If you go to either of them, it will reveal the contents of the crystal, after which you can take it back and hand it over to Radovid anyway.
If you don't give him the crystal, you will not receive payment. This includes the case if you gave it to the witch hunters, as they will have lied to him that they found it and he takes their word over yours. However, if you do have and give him the crystal, you'll receive 135. Regardless of your choice, the quest will end here. (50)","Talk to the witch hunters in front of Philippa's hideout.
Open Philippa's hideout. (50)
Search Philippa's hideout.
Use Aard to activate the crystal.
Find the missing crystal.
Place the crystal in the right spot.
Search Philippa's quarters using your Witcher Senses.
Only if either Triss or Yennefer are currently available to talk:
Talk to Triss about the crystal from Philippa's megascope.
Talk to Yennefer about the crystal from Philippa's megascope.
Tell Radovid what you learned about Philippa. (50)"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Rough_Neighborhood,Novigrad,"As soon as the prerequisite contract is completed, you can find a woman being harassed by several mercenaries just north of Shani's Clinic. Note: they'll only appear at night and is time sensitive: stray too far away once you find them and the quest will disappear. Interrupt them but no matter what you choose, the 3 mercenaries will enter a fistfight with you. There's no choice to lose the fistfight here: if you lose it'll treat it like you died and have to load a previous save. Furthermore, if you draw your sword and kill them, Dora will run from you and the quest will end here (giving you no reward).
Once they're knocked out, the woman, Dora, will note she could have handled them by herself but thanks you nonetheless. You can ask her a bit about how she'd have handled it, then offer to walk her home or just say goodbye (saying goodbye here will still net 25  but won't be able to talk to her later). She'll take you up on the offer after making it clear this isn't going to lead to anything, then heads towards home. Follow her a short distance and then choose whichever option and she'll say good night, earning 25  and completing this part of the quest.
Anytime later (like fast traveling to Novigrad Gate right after) you'll find 5 mercenaries in the courtyard just southeast of the Western Gate signpost. Note: If you walked Dora home, she'll actually be standing at the house, near the signpost, and will jump in to help fight. Otherwise, you're on your own. After finishing them off, and if Dora helped out, you can tell her whatever you wish, earning another 25  and concluding the quest.","Escort the woman to her home.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Spooked_Mare,Novigrad,"At the hut north-northwest of the Crossroads signpost near Oxenfurt, you'll find a man who calls out to you for help. Talk to him to learn he believes a ""woodland spook"" has stolen his gray horse. You can ask a bit more and he'll note only recently have horses gone missing, including a neighbor's. You can then agree to help or not.
Right near where the man was standing you'll indeed find drops of blood, but not much else to go on. Further south near the open pen you'll find hoofprints that you can then follow by foot or on Roach, eventually reaching a hidden pen with horses and Scoia'tael guarding over them. Note: you have to follow the trail to the commander until the dialogue with him triggers. If you jump over the fence, the Scoia'tael will immediately become hostile.
If you talk to the commander you'll learn they're stealing the horses to try and transport their wounded. You now have the following choices:
Say that they need the horses more (completes the quest without rewards)
Use Axii (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35 )
Pay 100  (10 )
Threaten them (starts a fight)
As long as you didn't agree for them to keep the horse, you'll earn 25 and then another 25 when you take a horse (this may be delayed because of a bug). The correct one is the gray one, however this is one of the few times you can get it wrong and be rewarded more.
Note: even if you agreed for them to keep the horse, you can still enter the pen and take one, which will re-activate the quest and follow the violent scenario. However, you can then fail the quest by telling the owner you couldn't find his horse.
Whichever horse you choose, ride it back and enter the pen next to the home, then talk to the man. If it was the correct one, he'll acknowledge it and pay you 20 . If you picked another horse though, he'll be glad that you brought him a young horse instead of his old one and pay you 50 . Regardless, the quest will then complete.

You may approach and talk with them, but note that if you don't back out after introductions, someone will be killed.
If you sit down to talk, introduce yourself as Geralt if you don't want to be attacked. If you refuse to state your name, Rufus and Manfred get suspicious and will attack you, leaving you no choice but to kill them both. (25)
After introductions, you can choose to leave now or ask about the world. This is your only chance to butt out and leave with no one dying (earning 25 ).
If you ask about the world, Manfred shows he's very knowledgeable about what's happening with the war, making Rufus suspicious and then decides to try and arrest Manfred, who refuses to go without a fight. You can tell Rufus ""hands off the merchant"" which will mean you have to kill Rufus (earning 25 ) or tell them both to calm down.
If you choose the latter, no matter your next choices Manfred will die, the only difference are the rewards:
If you refuse to help, you get no  or reward and can't attack Rufus as he kills Manfred.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Suspicious_Shakedown,Novigrad,"Head to the house just north of the Rosemary and Thyme, almost directly north of the Gate of the Hierarch signpost, to find an alley, where behind the alley's door are some bandits harassing a merchant. Interact with them and the bandits will try to get you to leave. If you choose ""at least I tried"" Geralt will leave them to it and the bandits will take the merchant's money and let him go. Important: if at any time you leave without helping, once the merchant returns to his store he'll refuse to do business with you.
If you choose to protect the merchant, you'll have three options:
threaten the bandits (will result in a fight)
use Axii (requires Delusion level 1 for a minimum of 30)
leave (will lock you out of doing business with the merchant)
As long as you help get rid of them, the merchant will thank the witcher and heads back home, concluding the quest. You can then find him later at his shop in Silverton where he'll either refuse to do business (if you left him to the bandits) or will be glad to see Geralt (if you helped him). If he was rescued, he'll also say he's giving a discount, but that's only dialogue and no price change occurs.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dwarven_Document_Dilemma,Novigrad,"Along the road south of Southern Gate and the bridge that connects over to the Seven Cats Inn you'll find Rostan Muggs, who'll tell you he needs urgent help, explaining he was attacked across the river and the thief ran off with some important documents.
Head out to the spot on the other end of the bridge to find a bottle of moonshine and pick up a trail. It might be a bit difficult to follow depending on the lighting, but it basically takes you right to the man sitting just outside the inn, Gerd. Talk to him and he'll reveal that Muggs actually lost the documents when they were gambling. You now have several options:
Demand the papers (leads to a fistfight)
Beat him at gwent
Use Axii (requires Delusion level 1, gives 30 )
Ask how much for them (he'll refuse to sell them)
Simply leave
Note that if you use one option and fail, you can continue trying the other options (note that you can only do one fistfight, but unlimited gwent attempts until you win). You can also simply choose to leave without the documents and confront Muggs about his story first. Quest loop: note that the only way to complete this quest is to get the documents. Otherwise, you'll be stuck in a loop to talk to Muggs or Gerd until you do.
If you go back and talk to Muggs, he'll confess, revealing the documents belonged to his employer and, desperate to get them back after losing them in a drunken gwent game, tried to get them back until Gerd pulled a weapon on him.
Once you get the documents, you'll learn they're the title to property. Head back to Muggs and, if you didn't confront him earlier, he'll reveal the truth. You can then hand the documents to him and he'll reward you with 25  and 20 , completing the quest.","Go to the place where Muggs was attacked and examine it using your Witcher Senses.
Use your Witcher Senses to follow the clues to find Muggs' attackers.
Confront Muggs about his story or get the documents from Gerd.
If Geralt demands the papers:
Defeat Gerd.
Compare Muggs' and the attacker's accounts.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Flame_of_Hatred,Novigrad,"To the east of Hierarch Square you'll find an Eternal Fire preacher condemning mages, alchemists, and especially witchers. Once you're close enough he'll start to personally insult you until you interact with him, where you can choose from 3 different options:
ask how many lives he's saved
threaten him to shut up
just leave
Any of them will earn 10  and the crowd will disperse, concluding this part of the quest.
However, if you chose any option but to leave, a few days later you'll be approached by two guards next to a well in The Bits (right in the middle between Hierarch Square and Southern Gate) with orders to interrogate you, accusing Geralt of offending religious sentiment. You then have two choices: hand over your weapons or refuse. Regardless what you choose, the guards will then remind you of the preacher you humiliated before attacking. If you surrendered your weapons you'll have to use your fists or other methods to fight them. After they're successfully taken care of, the quest will then end, earning 25 . If you handed your weapons over remember to loot them back.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Gangs_of_Novigrad,Novigrad,"Follow your map to find Cleaver in his headquarters near Hierarch Square and a cutscene will play out with him torturing someone in order to find the whereabouts of Whoreson Junior. Cleaver will then say that he believes Whoreson Junior is either at his casino or in his arena.
You can agree or refuse to work together, but the latter doesn't end the quest - it simply gives you an objective to think over his offer. Note: You can also talk to him after going to either the arena or casino (but not both), but you can only get the remaining location as an objective then.
Once you accept his offer, all you have to do is meet with his henchdwarves near each location and raid the places together with them. The rest of the events at both locations are part of the Get Junior quest. Note: If you stray too far away from the casino or the arena after talking to Cleaver's Henchdwarves, the quest will fail.
After you've killed everybody at both the arena and casino, simply go back to Cleaver for your reward, earning 150  per location and 50.","Talk to Cleaver.
If you refused Cleaver's offer:
Think over Cleaver's offer to help you find Whoreson Junior.
Offer accepted before going to the casino:
Meet Cleaver's dwarves outside the casino.
Destroy Whoreson Junior's casino.
Offer accepted before going to the arena:
Meet Cleaver's dwarves outside the arena.
Destroy Whoreson Junior's arena.
Talk to Cleaver. (50)"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Most_Truest_of_Basilisks,Novigrad,"Note: this quest marker will not appear unless it's between 7am-6pm, otherwise the people and cage are nowhere to be seen. However, once the quest marker does populate, it can be completed no matter what time of the day it is.
Just outside of Oxenfurt, northeast of Novigrad Gate and southwest of the Herbalist's Hut, a Beast Tamer advertises a ""basilisk"" to a group of Redanian soldiers. In actuality, it's a young, ill-fed wyvern.
You can inquire further about this ""basilisk"" if you wish, or just go straight to pointing out it's not one. Once it's pointed out that it's a wyvern, the soldiers start to realize the man's a cheat and move to take him when the cage suddenly breaks and the wyvern gets out. Kill it to complete the quest.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Nobleman_Statuette,Novigrad,"No real challenge, just buy the jade figurine from the merchant in Gildorf (he also sells the lizard figurine required for Of Dairy and Darkness), and bring it to Triss, who will revive the poor fellow.
The only real problem is that if you already completed Now or Never Triss will no longer be in Novigrad, and you will have to wait until Blindingly Obvious is completed much later in the game.","Talk to Triss about the statuette.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Price_of_Passage,Novigrad,"When traveling in Oxenfurt, you will be approached by two Redanian soldiers asking for a ""war tax."" They can be found under the archway leading from the Oxenfurt Harbor signpost to the marketplace. You have two options:
Option 1: Pay Them[]
This will cost you 50  but earn a total of 15  after the conversation ends. A few days later, you'll be able to find these guards on the western end of Novigrad Gate, where they'll once more ask for money, this time 100 . If you pay again you'll earn a total of 20  this time and you'll never see them after this, but if you refuse you'll only earn 10  and you may run into them on the eastern outskirts of Oxenfurt a few days later. If this is the case, they'll be angry at you for getting them into trouble. Regardless if you fight them with your fists or kill them with your sword, the quest will then end.
Option 2: Refuse to Pay[]
They will call their superior and accuse you of being a spy but the superior will not take the bait and will threaten to send them straight into battle for extorting money. The quest then finishes and you can be on your way. After some time, they can be encountered again east of Novigrad Gate (right next to two houses, close to the quest The Most Truest of Basilisks). You'll have the option to use Axii (and earn 40 ), pay them 50  (for 5 ), or engage them in a fist fight (or other weapons for a more lethal approach).",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Soldier_Statuette,Novigrad,"To start this quest, you must find and obtain the statuette during the secondary quest A Dangerous Game inside Caesar Bilzen's house. To then complete the quest, you just have to bring it to Triss who will revive the soldier.
Important: if you already completed Now or Never, Triss will no longer be in Novigrad and you will have to wait until you finish the Blindingly Obvious quest much later in the game. In fact, if Triss has already left Novigrad, Geralt will note that when finding the statuette and the quest will not appear until you can freely talk to her again.","Talk to Triss about the statuette.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Volunteer,Novigrad,"This quest may be started via is notice on Oxenfurt's notice board or by simply going to its location.
Head out to White Eagle Fort, which is just west of Oxenfurt Harbor, to hear a badly singing troll who goes by the name Trollololo. Talk to him to learn that he sees himself as a Redanian soldier now, having been asked by some to guard over some boats that the soldiers took from peasants in the area. However, the peasants arrived to take their boats back while the soldiers were still there and the two groups fought. Trollololo tried to help the soldiers but due to his brute strength he accidentally killed everyone, peasants and soldiers alike. He then decided to not let the ""meat"" go to waste and cooked and ate the bodies. Geralt can then decide to let it slide or kill Trollololo.
Kill him[]
If you opt to kill him, you'll gain 50 after killing him and a number of loot items off his body, which contains a mixture of animal hides and monster items. However, the most notable object off of him is a Cave troll liver.
Let it slide[]
If you opt to let it slide, he'll then ask you to retrieve some paint. If you didn't already buy it from the merchant in Oxenfurt, head there and buy the paint from him, then go talk to Trollololo again. He'll then realize he doesn't know how to paint the Redanian coat of arms and asks Geralt to do it. You can choose to or tell him he's better off painting it himself. Regardless of who paints it, you'll receive 50, the Gven'nel and Axeman's gauntlets diagrams, and a number of hides.","Look around the area.
If Geralt opts to kill Trollololo:
Kill the troll.
If Geralt opts to let it slide:
Find the paint the troll needs.
Deliver the paint to the troll."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Warehouse_of_Woe,Novigrad,"Along the back wall of Harborside district, a human and a dwarf are arguing outside of a warehouse they share, accusing each other of placing a monster inside the building. Geralt can decide whether or not to intervene and discover the truth of the matter.
If you choose not to help, the guard will decide he's had enough and takes both of them to have the captain decide. Important: once you accept the quest, don't stray too far away, otherwise the quest will fail.
If you agree to take care of the monster, enter the warehouse to find a single nekker. Slay it, then use your Witcher Senses to find the only two clues: a cage with its bars sawed off and a large footprint, with Geralt noting it's possibly a dwarf's. Exit the warehouse and talk to the guard, telling him that you took care of the monster. You can do a number of options depending on what you found inside:
If you tell the guard you do not know how the monster got in, he takes the matter to his captain, finishing the quest.
If you tell him you found a cage (but didn't find the footprint) the guard will happily take both of them away and lock them up if neither of them confesses.
If you reveal the cage and found the footprint then you have two choices:
Accuse the human. He will protest that the nonhumans were working together and gets hauled away. The dwarf then chortles, saying that the man wasn't a racist, he just talked tough. When Geralt questions him further, the dwarf admits that the human wasn't smart enough to concoct a plan like that, then goes on his way.
Accuse the dwarf. He will deny the accusation and is taken away. The man remarks that he can't wait to watch the dwarf hang and that he will need help getting onto the stool.
Regardless what you say, as long as you dealt with the nekker you'll be rewarded with 25  and 60 .","Kill the monster.
Tell the guardsman what happened in the warehouse.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Bard%27s_Beloved,Skellige,"In a cave at the end of a road east-northeast of the Palisade signpost, you'll find a troubled troubadour asking for help but then speaks of his beloved further in the cave and asks you to be quiet as not to wake her.
As this is rather odd, venture further into the cave to find his ""beloved"": a talking water hag surrounded by skeletons, obviously previous victims. You can either try to play along or not, but regardless you'll have to fight her. Once she's dead, it'll complete the quest, but as you exit the cave you'll see the bard has run off, unsurprising to say the least.","Find the troubadour's ""beloved"".
Defeat the water hag."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Hallowed_Horn,Skellige,"This quest may be started via a notice on Holmstein's notice board, or by finding the unmarked bandit camp where the horn is, north of Arinbjorn.
However you find the camp, kill off the bandits then loot the chest for the horn and a journal. If you found the horn before getting the notice, the journal will need to be read to know what to do next.
Head to Holmstein to find Mathios and give the horn back to him. He'll be displeased you killed the thieves as they weren't evil men, but will nonetheless reward you with 20 , completing the quest.","Track down the thieves and retrieve Holger's horn.
Find the stolen horn.
If you found the horn before the notice:
Read the journal you found in the chest with the horn.

All you really need to do is examine the human bones (around the open shed area, third building from the right) but if you want to find all the clues first, go into the far left building and, using Aard to blast the door open, loot the chest here for Letter from a druid. Then go into the far right hut for Lumberjack's letter to his wife, and the hut next it (the building between the lumberjack's letter and the bones) for Sawmill owner's notes.
Once you view the bones, the leshen will spawn, either near the far left or far right. Kill it off to finish the quest, gaining 20  and 50 .","Search the abandoned sawmill using your Witcher Senses. 0/4

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/An_Unpaid_Debt,Skellige,"After accepting help from Simun Brambling in Stranger in a Strange Land and finishing helping Blueboy Lugos at the Cave of Dreams, several days later you can find Simun again, outside the New Port Inn at Kaer Trolde. He asks the witcher to help him settle a score to fulfill his debt as his end of the favor. If you refuse to help, the quest will not start and Simun will leave, condemning Geralt to a shorter life for breaking an oath on Skellige. If you agree, then you must meet him at a hut by the lake near Blandare to repay the debt.
Once there, Simun asks Geralt to kill a man named Volund, who indicates that Simun had killed his brother by tricking and betraying him and thus swore revenge against him. You now have a choice to make.
If you agree to do what Simun asked, you'll fight Volund and a warrior. If you don't want to kill Volund, Simun Brambling will fight you, Volund and the warrior all together. Whichever side you take, after the fighting is over some parting words will be exchanged with the surviving party and the quest completes. (50)","Meet with Simun in the hut by the lake.
Depending on Geralt's decision:

If you approach too close the bandits will turn on you instead, so kill them off. You can then loot off one of the bodies Lugos' letter, though this won't have any bearing on the conversation with the hut's owner.
Knock on the door and the owner will come out, revealing they were Madman Lugos' men but he'll be fine now as he'll send word to Clan an Craite's jarl about what happened, though Geralt should keep low as he won't be as lucky if Lugos finds out about his involvement. The quest will then complete, giving 25 .",Knock on the door to check on the inhabitants of the house.

Petter is badly injured, having fallen from a great height off a stone statue while trying to light a fire atop its shoulders. Though succeeding, the ferocity of the fire caused him to fall and break his leg. Geralt can offer Petter some celandine to help dull the pain or simply leave them be.
Unlike other quests, this quests doesn't have a ""fail"" status if you leave them, it simply never appears in one's journal.","This quest has no journal objectives.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_the_Wild,Skellige,"Just east-southeast of Arinbjorn is a forest inhabited by a large pack of white wolves and, only at night, the ulfhedinn will also appear with them. Kill them off to complete the quest.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Coronation,Skellige,"This quest immediately follows King's Gambit, after the gathering of the jarls at Kaer Trolde. Geralt speaks to Crach an Craite, who thanks him for bringing the party responsible for the Vildkaarl massacre to justice. Crach proclaims that he must ride for Gedyneith, as it is time to pick a king. You may choose to go with him, in which case you'll be instantly transported to Gedyneith, or exit the conversation to make your own way there.
Upon reaching Gedyneith, you'll see an already-sizeable congregation beneath the sacred oak. The eldest of the jarls, Donar an Hindar introduces the new ruler, either Cerys or Hjalmar, depending on which one of them you helped during King's Gambit after the massacre at Kaer Trolde.
Following the victory speech, Madman Lugos storms off from the crowd in a rage, clearly displeased by the fact that an an Craite has taken the throne. It is at this point that the quest ends, though you may stick around to speak to the victor, and the many other characters in the congregation to gauge their opinions of the new ruler.",Attend the coronation under the sacred oak. (200)
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment,Skellige,"Sail to the peninsula east of the Ancient Crypt to find a man chained to a rock being attacked by harpies.
After you kill off the monsters, you can talk to Yorg, who claims he was framed for murder and begs you to free him. You can choose to free him or leave him to his fate. If you choose the latter, the quest will fail once you travel far enough away.
If you choose to free him, he'll thank you and offer to help you out should they ever meet again. The quest will then complete. (10)
While that completes the quest, you can learn more by heading to Rogne where, on the northwest outskirts of the village, you'll find a group of mourners at the murdered man's grave, Gretter, praising how good of a man he was and the vile criminal, Yorg, should have been punished more severely. A young girl in the group will then cry out that her brother was a good man before running a short distance away.
Go over and talk to her to learn she's Yorg's sister and that she's to blame: she didn't like their uncle so she lied and told Yorg that Gretter had done bad things to her, sending her brother into a flying rage and killing their uncle. If you freed Yorg, you can choose to tell her you freed him and she'll be happy and swear to never lie again, or you can coldly tell her that she learned her lesson. If you left Yorg to his fate, the latter is the only option. Regardless of what you choose, the conversation will end and the journal will update.",Help the prisoner.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Farting_Trolls,Skellige,"Along the road between Arinbjorn and Kaer Muire, you'll find an unmarked cave entrance just west of the Place of Power here and, almost as soon as you enter it, you'll hear the unmistakable sounds of farting.
Head further in to hear 3 rock trolls conversing (while continuing to fart). However, they're not friendly and if they sense you they will attack. Unfortunately if you wish to explore the cave you'll have no other choice but to kill them off.
Once they're dead that'll complete the quest. However if you're also looking for witcher diagrams, a chest near the boat contains the Enhanced Ursine boots diagram.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Finders_Keepers_(The_Witcher_3),Skellige,"To start the quest, head to the larger of the islands north of Giants' Toes' signpost (the one with a shipwreck) to find several bandits trying to loot the crates. Kill them and Geralt will comment on the crates, starting the quest. You can then examine each crate to see one has Clan Brokvar's insignia on it and the other contains the Solid Skellige sword.
Head to Svorlag village on Spikeroog and speak with the merchant at the docks about the crates and he'll comment that it must have been one of their ships that sailed out a month ago to raid the Continent but never returned. He'll then ask about the decorated sword which, if you retrieved it, Geralt will automatically hand it over for a finder's fee of 55  and 75 , completing the quest. If you didn't get the sword, you'll instead be paid 50  (but same amount of ).","Look for signs indicating the cargo's owner using your Witcher Senses.
Ask the shopkeeper in the Clan Brokvar village on Spikeroog about the shipwrecked cargo."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Fists_of_Fury:_Champion_of_Champions,Skellige,"This is the final fist-fighting quest in the base game, issued after becoming the fist-fighting champion in all three main regions that have fist fights: Velen, Novigrad, and Skellige. After becoming champion in the third location, wherever that happens to be, a man will approach and offer you the chance to fight the Champion of Champions. He instructs you to sail to Spikeroog and head to the arena, which is located in the village of Hov.
Upon arriving at the village, speak to the Bookie who is leaning against a wooden pillar in front of the arena's entrance. If you have not yet completed the quest Master of the Arena, the Bookie will inform you that the arena is closed due to an unresolved incident. Otherwise, he reveals that the reigning champion is, in fact, a rock troll, and initiates the fight. During this fight, it is possible to use consumables such as food items and potions.
Important: completion of this quest also unlocks the ""Brawl Master"" achievement/trophy, though if you didn't defeat the troll, then the fight cannot be repeated and this achievement unobtainable. Creating a save prior to the fight however will allow you to repeat the fight.
After defeating the rock troll, Geralt is proclaimed the Champion of Champions, and the Bookie says that he will send word of this news to the four corners of the world. The quest then ends, and you are awarded 90 and a diagram for The Tamer. You can talk to the troll after the fight and he'll tell you what his name is.","Go to Spikeroog to find out about this mysterious opponent.
Enter the arena.
Kill or be killed."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Fists_of_Fury:_Skellige,Skellige,"This quest may be started via its notice on Kaer Trolde Harbor's notice board or simply encountering one of the spots where fist fights take place.
When you first arrive in Skellige, you'll most likely come across the fistfighters at the harbor first, in front of The New Port. Here, you'll have to fight Valgard, however he'll ask to talk to you for a moment in private.
He'll point out he's trying to impress a nearby woman, Eryka, but obviously doesn't stand a chance against a witcher. You can tell him whatever you like before the fight begins but can change your mind during it. Valgard's reaction will differ a bit depending (for instance, if you agree but then defeat him anyways he'll be upset you backed out of your promise, while if you refused but lost, he'll boast to Eryka rather than privately thanking the witcher). If you threw the fight, you can fight him again. Regardless what you do, once you win you'll gain 25  and 70 .
The other two opponents are straightforward:
In Arinbjorn you'll find Grim (25  and 70 )
In Harviken you'll find Einar (25  and 70 )
Note that the diagrams given out are based on order: your first opponent will drop diagram: The Digger and your third opponent will drop diagram: Nilfgaardian guardsman armor.
Once all 3 are defeated, you now have the chance to fight Skellige's champion, Olaf on An Skellig. Head to the arena northeast of Urialla Harbor and talk to the bookie who'll inform you Olaf will appear once he has an opponent to face. Once you're ready, let him know and head into the arena. Note: Your health won't be set to full at the start and end of the fight. After a short cutscene you learn your opponent is a bear that you have to punch to death. Once you win, you'll earn 50 , 90 , and Gwestog.","Defeat Valgard.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Flesh_for_Sale,Skellige,"Head to Faroe Isle and make your way to Trottheim, which is currently under control by pirates. Starting from how you even approach the village, the quest can go a number of ways.
If you approach any other way but through one of the guarded gates, you'll automatically have to kill the pirates to advance the quest.
If you approach the western or eastern gates, the pirates at the chosen gate will mistaken Geralt as the person sent by a Nilfgaardian named Ville. You can choose to go along with the act or try to correct them. If you try to correct them the first time, they'll insist you stop playing dumb and you can choose to go along with it or try to correct them again. If you try to correct them this time, though, all the pirates in the area will become hostile, and you'll have to kill them all to continue the quest.
If you go along with it, the pirate will lead you to their leader in the middle of the village, who'll remark on Geralt not looking Nilfgaardian and you can choose to reveal yourself or insist you do work for Ville. Revealing yourself will naturally lead to a fight with all the pirates. If you play along though, the leader will then ask for the agreed upon amount and you can go with several options:
pay 500  (50 )
use Axii to convince him you already paid (requires Delusion level 3; 40 )
reveal you're not a slave trader (makes all the pirates hostile)
Fight the Pirates[]
If at any time you chose to fight the pirates, you'll need to kill them all off, then find the slave driver's body for 2 keys: his house key and the slave cell key. The first will unlock the house that you meet the leader in front of while the second is needed to unlock the slave cell.
Go and unlock the slave cell and the women will thank you before one of them suggests the pirate leader had kept some valuables in his house. You'll then earn 50 , Diagram: Ban Ard breastplate and a Lesser Dazhbog runestone, completing the quest. You can then go and loot the house for additional valuables.
Play Along[]
If you played along all the way through, Geralt will eventually convince the leader to give him the key to the slave cell, despite the leader warning they're not responsible if any should escape. Go over and unlock it and, after you threaten them, lead the group out the western gate to the indicated area. Once there the women will thank you, earning 50  and the Diagram: Ban Ard breastplate, completing the quest.","If Geralt fights his way through:
Defeat the pirates.
Find the key to the slaves' cell.
Free the slaves.
Played along all the way through:
Follow the pirate to his boss.
Free the slaves.
Lead the slaves away from the pirate village."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/For_Fame_and_Glory,Skellige,"Head to the first cave just west of Larvik to find two warriors outside the entrance and approach to automatically talk with them to learn they plan to clear the cave of the necrophages inside.
If you offer to help they'll accept your assistance. Important: you need to keep both of them alive to complete the quest. However, they're both overzealous about glory and will recklessly run in, most likely getting themselves killed in the process. To counter this, try to use Axii on at least one of them at the entrance to hopefully keep them at bay a short while. It's then possible to do it a second time inside.
Head in and go to the right to run into a large group of ghouls and devourers and kill them off, making sure to watch your allies and their health bars. Throwing a northern wind bomb before engaging is a good idea. Once all these necrophages are dead, head further into the cave to find an alghoul. Once it's dead Geralt will automatically talk with the two warriors again, giving 50  and 60  as a reward, completing the quest.",Help the warriors kill the necrophages in the old mine.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Spirit,Skellige,"To start this quest, go to Snidhall Isle, the island north of the Ancient Crypt where, along the southern shore, you'll find two Skelligers about to enter a fight. If you don't interfere, there's a chance the quest giver will be killed so jump in if you want the quest.
Despite both showing exclamation marks, only the one in the blue tunic matters as he's the quest giver. Kill the angry warrior and Ivar will speak with you, explaining he wants to marry the warrior's sister, Irma, but she's a priestess and their religion forbids it, but there's bound to be loopholes. He'll then ask you to find him books on the subject as you travel (25 ).
Depending on how much you've traveled and bought, you might have some (or all) of the books already which include:
The Cult of Freya: bought from the alchemist preacher in Novigrad's Electors' Square (doesn't appear at night)
The Curious Cases of Virtuous Vegga: bought from Gildorf district shop's merchant in Novigrad
Change your life! A Handbook: bought from the Loan Shark in The Bits in Novigrad
Tristianna and Isador: bought from the merchant in Lindenvale
Religion and Life: bought from the merchant in Crow's Perch, or (since Patch 4.0) merchant at Devil's Pit
You can talk and hand over any books at any time to Ivar, though naturally as he's out of the way it's best to do it in one trip if possible. Bug: sometimes if you hand over all 5 books at once, the quest won't complete. If you run into this, try to hand over one at a time.
Once you hand them all over, he'll decide he can't learn anymore sitting there on the island and thanks you, giving 50  and completing the quest.
While the quest may be complete, you can bump into him later just east of where Odrin can be found in the Silverton district of Novigrad. He'll explain he hasn't given up on being with Irma but decided to seek out more culture in Novigrad to learn more, but as he needs to also earn money he's looking to sign on with a ship.","Gather books describing religious customs and precedents and take them to Ivar.
Take the books you found to Ivar, he might find them interesting."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Gwent:_Skellige_Style,Skellige,"Note: While the quest can be picked up any time from the notice board at Kaer Trolde Harbor, it cannot truly be started until Echoes of the Past is completed. Additionally, Practicum in Advanced Alchemy also has to be completed to unlock two of the matches.
Ermion is always the first player to face, but the earliest point to do that is while he walks away right after Echoes of the Past. You can later find him at Gedyneith. Once beaten, he will award you the Leshen card and direct you to Gremist and Crach an Craite.
Gremist, just north of Gedyneith, cannot be played until Practicum in Advanced Alchemy is completed. When beaten, he gives you the Mysterious Elf card and directs you to Madman Lugos.
Madman Lugos is found at Kaer Muire. However, unless Svanrige becomes king, he cannot be played after you set sail for Skellige at the start of Battle Preparations. If you miss that last opportunity, an objective to loot his Vampire: Katakan card will appear. In this case, you will get a red mark for winning the match, but  is still awarded when the card is looted.
Note: At least as of Patch 4.0, Ermion and Lugos are still available in their usual places before asking Crach where the druid is for The Sunstone - even though Geralt supposedly doesn't know where Ermion is, he's not yet gone to Kaer Muire and is just chilling at Gedyneith, allowing to go through everything needed to unlock the match with Madman Lugos.
Crach is usually found in his room at the Kaer Trolde citadel. When beaten, he gives you the Draug card and directs you to Sjusta. However, Crach can't be played after you start the battle during On Thin Ice. Should this happen, the objective to play him will be removed, you'll simply receive his card (no  though) and be directed to Sjusta.
Sjusta is always at his place at Kaer Trolde Harbor and beating him awards the Yaevinn card.
Winning each match awards 25 and when you're done with all of the above, you'll also be awarded the Emhyr var Emreis: The White Flame leader card as the quest completes.","Win a unique card from Ermion.
Win a unique card from Crach an Craite.
Win a unique card from Gremist.
Win a unique card from Sjusta.
Win a unique card from Madman Lugos.
If you couldn't play Madman Lugos:
Search Lugos' room and find a unique card."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Hard_Times,Skellige,"This quest can be started on the road between Blandare and Miners' Camp. You'll know you're at the right spot when you run into a cyclops near an overturned wagon.
Once the threat is dealt with, examine the corpse and dead horse, which will then update the search area. Just on the other side of the road you'll find a trail of footprints and blood splatters until you find a second corpse. Prior to Patch 4.0, you'd have to fight a group of nekkers on the trail, but after it there are a couple of ghouls directly over the body instead. Once the enemies are dead, loot the corpse for a letter to Yanne.
Head to Kaer Trolde keep to speak to the blacksmith. Bug: note that this character tends to be bugged, either not appearing or not available to talk to. You may have to save and meditate a couple times before you can finally interact with him during the day.
Talk with Yanne and he'll ask how you found the letter. If you tell him he'd rather not know he'll assume you robbed and killed his family and will refuse to do business with you. The quest will then reward 25  before completing.
If you tell him the truth, he'll still refuse to do business with you for a time but will thank Geralt for informing him and will give you 20  along with 25 , completing the quest.","Investigate the broken cart using your Witcher Senses.
Use your Witcher Senses to follow the tracks leading away from the broken cart.
Read the letter you found on the dead woman's body.
Deliver the letter to the smith at Kaer Trolde."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/In_Wolf%27s_Clothing,Skellige,"This quest can be picked up either through the main quests, Missing Persons and Nameless, or from the notice board at Larvik.
Once picked up, go talk to Josta at the nearby Temple of Freya, who informs you killing Morkvarg will be no ordinary feat: apparently he's been killed many times before only to keep coming back after each time. Undoubtedly, this signifies a powerful curse is in place. Inquiring further reveals it was allegedly cast by the late archpriestess Ulve, who, on her dying breath, cursed Morkvarg for all his foul deals, but in particular for attacking Freya's Garden, a sacred place. To learn more though you can talk with Einar, a pilgrim on that fateful day who happened to survive the events.
Head to Larvik's harbor to find him getting ready to set sail. He'll tell you how he remembered Ulve uttering the curse that transformed Morkvarg into a werewolf and proceeded to attack his men but couldn't devour any of them as they turned to ash in his mouth. Despite it all, Einar escaped, though a few things still seem off with his story.
If you haven't already, investigate the garden where you will have to deal with some wolves, although most of them can be skipped if you know where to go. Don't bother with the small house there yet, as the rooms inside are locked. You need to go to the southestern end of the sanctuary where you'll come across a body first, with a lone wolf guarding it, and then past that a small bridge followed by a ladder (built into the wall) to climb.
Find Morkvarg[]
There you'll find a mechanism with two levers, which opens floodgates in the small river below. You're supposed to use that and there will even be a cutscene if this is your first time seeing it, but not yet. This is also where the paths for this quest and Nameless split, in case you're doing them at the same time. Continue further ahead to find a cave and as you enter, a cutscene will trigger with Morkvarg talking to himself about a lost key.
At this point you can backtrack and go search for the key in question, but unless you really want to avoid a fight, it's better to attack him. If you do, once his health is cut down enough (somewhere between a quarter and almost dead), he'll fall and you can interact with him to start a conversation. He will plead with Geralt to lift the curse, promising a reward. Afterwards, you have the option to feed him, which is one of the ways to lift the curse, but if this is your first encounter, you wouldn't have the correct thing to feed him with yet. Finish him off, or leave him - either way he'll vanish, dropping regular werewolf loot, but also werewolf meat. While still in the cave, you can use Witcher Senses to examine a hole in the floor, adding another objective to find a flooded cave - this is where the lost key is.
Floodgates[]
Now, return to the floodgate mechanism found before the cave. Activating the lever on the right-hand side will close the currently opened flood gate—while the lever on the left-hand side will open the next flood gate. Neither flood gate is strictly necessary to go though before the quest can be completed, but one unlocks more options, as well as some loot.
The ""center"" flood gate, or straight ahead from the vantage point of the mechanism, will lead you into the other side of the garden that you can currently see, but has two doors to it locked (the wooden one on the opposite side of the sanctuary, and the grate one to your right). You are supposed to go there eventually, but it's more practical to retrieve both keys first. Note: it is possible to jump over this gate to get past it without ever using the mechanism.
The ""right"" flood gate, or the one closest the werewolf cave, will lead you to the flooded cave and lost key that Morkvarg was talking about. Dive underneath the opened flood gate, swim through the long tunnel, grab the key, and swim back. This key will unlock both doors to the garden, as well as the rooms in the house near the sacred tree, where you dropped down from at the very start.
Trick the werewolf[]
If you wish to just get rid of the werewolf quickly, open the ""left"" gate and through it, after climbing into the garden, head east to the building with a broken down door. There are a few things to examine there, but the important one is a bloodied werewolf's leg on a chain. Once you interact with it, a small cutscene triggers with Morkvarg appearing and telling you how the curse doesn't allow him to die, making him always return from death.
He will ask if you wish to hear a story, and listening to it, if you're attentive, provides a hint for a flaw in the curse. Regardless though, you have to fight him eventually and then talk again when he falls down. Unless you ran away from him in the cave, you can now feed him his own flesh - the werewolf meat he dropped. If you haven't fought him before, just finish him off here and loot the werewolf meat, then go around into his cave lair to find him there a second time.
The curse doesn't allow for Morkvarg to eat his own flesh, so when he does, it ends with his life. You'll be awarded 50, a non-relic Salmian brigandine and can go to Josta to get her reward as well. However, you miss on more rewards by getting rid of the werewolf this way, though you can still get hidden treasures by exploring the other route afterwards.
Lift the curse[]
Open the ""right"" gate and swim through the flooded tunnel until you reach the cave, right underneath Morkvarg's lair. Search the skeleton remains there to find a padlock key, exactly what you are looking for. With it, swim back through the flooded tunnel and head for the house near the sacred tree.
Once inside the house, unlock and search both rooms. The room on the right isn't necessary, but it has worthwhile loot. In the left one you'll find a chest with Morkvarg's journal and reading it will reveal that Einar lied to you and he was actually part of Morkvarg's crew, so it's time to confront him.
Return to the harbor near Larvik, and when you call Einar a liar you'll have two options: fight him and his mates, or calm him down and say you're only interested in lifting the curse. If you choose the peaceful route, he'll provide the necessary information - he was the one to curse Morkvarg to begin with, cutting him with a fang, which merely needs to be given to the werewolf in order to lift the curse. After this, you can demand the fang and have to fight for it, or convince him to part with it for priestesses. If you do the latter, he'll make one request: kill Morkvarg once the curse is lifted. Important: you will get the cursed fang no matter what, but without Einar's confession, Geralt doesn't have the knowledge to use it. Then the option to give it to Morkvarg won't appear when you meet again and you'll be left with no choice, but to feed him his own flesh (see previous section).
Head back to the garden and find Morkvarg again. If you haven't seen him inside the garden building yet (where the other option is revealed), you can trigger the scene there if you wish, but he'll always be back inside the cave after you've talked to Einar. No matter what, you'll need to cut him down again before you can talk, but this time you should have the choice to give him the cursed fang.
When you do, the curse is lifted and Morkvarg is human again. (80) He'll be quite excited for a moment, before you can either honor Einar's wish and fight again to kill him (85), or ask for the reward he mentioned (80), in which case he'll instruct you to find the Loan Shark in Novigrad. Note: asking for his reward is the more profitable option in every way, and you can still attack and kill him as he leaves.
Collecting payment(s)[]
You will always get 50 and 85  from Josta.
Unfortunately, Einar didn't promise and won't give anything for honoring his request, but if you asked Morkvarg for a reward after lifting the curse, go see the Loan Shark in The Bits for another 50, Deithwen and (if you don't already have it) Torn-out page: Werewolf decoction.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Maiden,Skellige,"East of Harviken, on the top of a hill, you'll see a laid out ring in which a woman fights and knocks out her opponent before demanding if there's really no one that can best her. Approach and she'll reveal herself as Jutta an Dimun. However, she won't fight a nobody and thus asks Geralt to perform a worthy feat to fight her and will give one of the following tasks:
defeat Gundar in Harviken
recover Horned Hoskuld's sword
Note that certain feats will allow you to skip any tasks as she'll recognize your name:
Defeat Olaf (Fists of Fury: Skellige)
If you've already found the sword or defeated Olaf, she'll acknowledge Geralt as a worthy opponent and fight him on the spot. If you didn't do it yet though, you must complete it to continue the quest.
The tasks[]
If asked to defeat Gundar, it'll be a sword fight and you must take care not to leave the arena to beat him. You can also use this to your advantage: if having a hard time defeating him, try to force him to back out of the ring (like near the nearby hut).
If you were given the sword task, go to the far western part of Faroe Isle to find the sunken treasure chest, and where a bunch of ekhidnae are flying over. Deal with the nearby threats (if you're lucky, you'll only need to kill a couple) then dive down and retrieve the sword, then head back to Jutta.
Talk to Jutta[]
Once your task is complete, talk to Jutta and tell her, and she'll then fight you. If you instead tell her you refuse to fight, she'll refuse to fight you in the future. This can then lead to a bug: while the quest won't mark as failed, when you then try to talk to her about fighting, she'll give you another task, sometimes including the same one you just did, and the quest won't acknowledge it.
If you do fight her, bear in mind not to use any signs, crossbow, bombs, or potions, as the quest will fail owing to it not being a fair fight. Also note you only get one shot at this: if she defeats you instead the quest will fail and you won't get another chance to fight her.
After knocking her health down significantly she'll yield (25 ) then ask where you learned to fight and regardless what you say, she'll insinuate meeting her at her place after dusk. You can take her up on her offer or not. Note: if you choose not to take her offer right here, the quest will mark as failed.
Head to her home (the earliest at 8pm) to talk with her and she'll reveal her vow to Freya: she swore she'd marry the man who could best her in a fight and have children with him, but turns out Geralt, a witcher, is sterile. If you tell her you can help with the other part of that, the two will have sex. If you instead tell her the wrong guy beat her, the two will just talk before ending the night with her commenting how it's time she left Faroe. Note: sleeping with her will have no effect on your relationship with Yennefer or Triss.
Note that if Geralt sleeps with Jutta after the encounter he will be disrobed and unarmed and you'll need to reequip all his armor and weapons; this differs from most other encounters (i.e., Triss, Yennifer, Keira, prostitutes) which automatically restore Geralt's inventory after.","The following are mutually exclusive and depends on the task given:
Look for the sword Jutta requested in the sunken ship's wreck using your Witcher Senses.
Defeat Gundar.
Tell Jutta you have performed the feat.
Defeat Jutta.
Meet Jutta at her home after dusk."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/King%27s_Gambit,Skellige,"At the entrance to Kaer Trolde, the portcullis will be closed but it will open when the player approaches. Follow Arnvald to the feast hall where you'll see Hjalmar and Cerys quarrel. After the conversation ends, you're free to roam around and there's an extra conversation with Cerys if you find and talk to her outside.
Fistfights[]
There's a profitable opportunity if you approach Hjalmar while he's in the middle of a fistfight. He'll challenge you to defeat a vildkaarl in a fistfight to win his prized steel sword. (100) Lose and Geralt either forfeits his own sword or pays 350  to keep it.
After Hjalmar's challenge, you can also challenge the other vildkaarls in a sequence of three fistfights, each awarding 50. These brawlers hit very hard and the second and third fighters are capable of countering the player if too many attacks are thrown. They always start off with a heavy punch when the player regains control so counter that and work from there. Undying can help from getting KO'ed. An easy tactic is to first counter then perform two strong punches and counter again, rinse and repeat.
Important: all fistfights must be completed before talking to Crach.
Official business[]
Once you're ready, approach Crach's room and a cutscene will play where Birna Bran barges through the door while appearing a bit mad. Geralt and Birna have a small chat with each other. She is complaining about the king-choosing system (which consists of voting for the next king) and implies that Svanrige, Bran's firstborn, should be the next king by birthright instead. Eventually she tells Geralt that she will be leaving tomorrow and goes her own way. You then talk to Crach An Craite, who gives you the Fate silver sword as a reward for helping his children. (500)
As he does this, another small cutscene triggers where the people scream ""Lu-gos! Lu-gos! Lu-gos!"" and then suddenly, screams and a few roars are heard. The two head for the feast hall and witness a massacre by three bears. You then have to defeat the bears. (300)
Important: this is unknown to Geralt yet, but these are berserkers susceptible to cursed oil and silver swords, not regular bears.
Following the massacre, Hjalmar and Cerys both decide to investigate the matter further. Geralt must make a decision to help Cerys, Hjalmar or neither (in which case the quest ends). Your choice here will affect who becomes king or queen of Skellige, and ultimately the fates of the two an Craite siblings.
Side with Cerys[]
Use your Witcher Senses to search the hall. Once you examine one of the bears Geralt discovers they are half-human half-bear, similar to werewolves, and notices the mead they drank smelled odd. After finding the right container it turns out the mead contained some mushrooms and Geralt picks up a trail of the smell, so follow it to find the horn that contained it. Geralt will now call over Cerys and start conversing. She will confirm those so-called ""humans"" were berserkers and then suggests talking to Hjort to find out which mushrooms were added to the mead. When you go outside to find him, there is an optional conversation with the Jarls. When you speak to the druid, he will identify the mushrooms as ""Mardroeme"", which, according to legends, can turn people into animals. Geralt and Cerys agree that the mead must have been spiked before the celebration so she will lead Geralt to the wine cellar.
Once there, use Witcher Senses to find the right barrel. When you do someone will attempt to kill Cerys and Geralt by lighting up spilled Mahakaman spirit. Cerys will say there is another exit but it's hidden behind some barrels and there is no time to move them before they suffocate. Geralt will say he has no intention of ""moving"" them and you can probably guess he intends to use Aard to remove the obstacle so do just that. Run through the secret passage which will take you to a Quen place of power.
Important: this is the only way to reach this place of power. If you go with Hjalmar or decide not to get involved you will not earn this skill point. Also, this is the only way to find the true culprit, so helping Cerys is the best option for both roleplaying and character development.
Once you are back in the castle, Cerys will propose checking the cellar entrance as the ""pyromaniac"" must have used the same entrance, while Geralt will mention hearing a bottle being dropped. When you reach the door you will discover that someone stepped inside some mead leaving a trail to follow. Once the trail ends you will find a piece of thread on the wall. Cerys will recognize it as belonging to Arnvald (300) and you then go to catch him at the keep entrance. He will try to run away on a horse and a chase ensues with you automatically starting on Roach after the cutscene.
Don't waste time, because he can escape. You can still complete the quest in that case, but with a red objective mark. There are three ways that this can play out:
Catch him during the chase by hitting him with your sword
This is fairly easy to do with a decent saddle, which you should have by now. He will fall from the horse and Cerys will interrogate him until he admits to conspiring with Birna and gives a letter written by the queen.
He gets too far away and escapes
This fails an objective and you have to follow his horse's tracks all the way to the beach where you originally landed on Skellige. There you will find him dead and loot his body to find a key, then have to return to Kaer Trolde to continue the investigation. Back at the keep, Cerys will lead you to Arnvald's room where you have to find a piece of perfumed paper, giving a scent which leads you to a secret compartment. Inside it, unlocking a box reveals the same letter from Birna that you would've gotten if you caught him.
Chase him all the way to the beach
In this case, Arnvald is double-crossed by a few seamen wearing Clan Tuirseach colors and you have to save him from them. He's actually quite strong against them and will most likely survive without you doing anything, with Cerys also joining the fight, but it is possible for him to die. If he survives, the rest plays out as if you caught him during the chase. If he dies, then it's the same scenario as if he escaped (except a different objective fails and you know who killed him), and you go to search his room.
Birna's punishment
Regardless, you now know that the mastermind was Birna Bran. (200) Cerys will gather the jarls to reveal the findings and the conversation will differ depending on how you found out, with Arnvald appearing as a witness too if he is alive. However, your dialogue choices don't really matter and the outcome is always the same. The evidence is insufficient and all appears to be in vain until Birna's son, Svanrige Tuirseach, steps up to ask her why she told him to leave the celebration early, right before the attack took place. She will admit then and be sentenced to death by thirst and starvation, after being chained to a rock. Note: if you later go to the shore north of Sund you will be able to see the Jarl's made good on her sentence.
Side with Hjalmar[]
Hjalmar will take Geralt to Fornhala where the vildkaarl reside as he was witness to them turning into the bears that attacked, so clearly it's time for some payback. After the conversation, just a few steps ahead another cutscene triggers and Hjalmar will point out a body uphill.
If you just want to go through this quickly, after this cutscene you may simply go to the large hut on the southern end of the village and find a hatch there. However, if you want to examine all the clues, note that there's a specific order intended for them and it can be quite confusing if that order isn't followed. Some minor objects in the huts can be examined, but only result in minor comments. The first real trail is the body that Hjalmar pointed out, so go there and inspect it. The body itself is placed against an altar and there are also some discarded clothes nearby, but they are unimportant. Examine the altar to learn that it is to Svalblod, a forbidden god which demands human sacrifices. There are some dishes in front of it and Geralt will pick up a smell from them, so follow it to another body and a blood stain. Once examined, some footprints become your new trail and lead you to a house with interesting decorations and a hidden hatch in the floor. Enter the hidden entrance and soon you will hear some strange noises, before meeting Halgrim. (200)
After a short conversation you will have to fight him. Once he is injured enough he will transform into a bear and the fight resumes. After the fight ends, keep pushing forward and soon enough a cutscene triggers where a strange ritual led by a druid takes place. Now you need to interrogate the druid, named Artis, but he will refuse to tell who is behind the attacks and you are forced to fight him and another berserker. Once they are dead, you find a letter revealing the druid would've become the new king's advisor in return for causing the massacre. (300)
You then return to Kaer Trolde to speak with the jarls, and while you couldn't find the true culprit, the deed is enough to cleanse the an Craite name from dishonor.
Aftermath[]
If you chose to help Cerys or Hjalmar, after the whole ordeal is over, you will talk with Crach again, who will give you yet another item reward - the Death From Above crossbow, before the quest completes. (400) He will then invite you to the Coronation of Skellige's new ruler. In game you don't learn who that is until attending, but it will be whomever you chose to side with during this quest. You can go there immediately or join later.
However, if you didn't help either of the siblings, the quest will have completed right then and there. Later Svanrige becomes king, as was Birna's wish. The Coronation quest will not appear in this case, and obviously you've missed on plenty of rewards as well. Note: if you just let the quest fail instead of completing it via the dialogue choice after the berserkers' attack, Cerys and Hjalmar later die in battle alongside each other.","If accepted Hjalmar's challenge:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Master_of_the_Arena,Skellige,"Head to the arena in Hov on Spikeroog to learn of a wraith that haunts the arena, preventing warriors from fighting in it. Note: you must talk with the guards in the tower or the wraith first to fight him, otherwise your strikes will do nothing against him and he won't fight back. Also, for maximum reward and experience, talk with the guards before lifting the curse.
The guards in the tower overlooking the arena will reveal the wraith was once a man named Ulle the Unlucky, who lost every bout he fought and during one tournament was paired against the jarl Thormar, who ridiculed Ulle so much the warrior killed the jarl while they were in the arena, and thus the jarl cursed him that he should never win a fight. You can then agree to help them out and they'll offer a reward on top of a percentage of the profit from the first fight once the arena is usable again (the second reward is only available if you talk to them before lifting the curse).
With this in mind, head into the arena to meet Ulle, who passively walks around the arena proclaiming everyone always beats him. You can talk with him to learn more, revealing he's bored and just get it over with, sparing the banal remarks. If you choose to fight and kill him, you'll quickly see it was rather useless and didn't do anything and will have to wait a few days for Ulle to appear again.
However, if you paid attention to the story, you'll realize to lift the curse you must let Ulle win. This time, when you fight him, don't strike back and instead let Ulle wound you enough for him to defeat Geralt, lifting the curse (25 ). Once the curse is lifted, talk with the guards who will reward you an additional 10  and 15  regardless if you talked to them beforehand or not. If you didn't talk to them, this will conclude the quest. If you did talk to them before lifting the curse though, return in a few days and talk to the guards once more, who'll give you an additional 25  and 20 , concluding the quest.","Talk with the villagers about the problem at the arena.
Find a way to send Ulle on to the afterlife.
Return to the warriors.
If the guards were talked to beforehand:
Return to the Spikeroog arena later to collect your percent of the takings."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Peace_Disturbed,Skellige,"You can start this quest two ways: the main one is to talk to the women first but requires facing all the monsters. The second way is to find the hidden entrance in which case you'll only face the main monster.
To start the main way, head to the cave southeast of Kaer Trolde Harbor to find two women just outside it and, on spotting Geralt, will call you over. Talk to them to learn they wish to cut the toenails and fingernails of the dead inside as that's the material used to build the mythological ship, the Naglfar. However, the crypt is haunted by wraiths, preventing them from entering.
Agree to help them then head into the crypt. The first floor is void of threats, but the first room down the stairs contains a single wraith. Once killed, head to the next room which has two waiting wraiths, then finally head down the stairs to deal with the remaining two wraiths. Note that the body here also contains Daystar. You'll also notice a destroyable rock wall that leads you through a long, twisting tunnel and out an unmarked entrance just outside Kaer Trolde's gate.
However, you'll notice the objective to kill all the monsters hasn't gone away. Turn back and backtrack to leave and near the stairs that go up to the first floor a nightwraith appears. Kill her to complete the objective. You can then head back out to let the women know the threats are dealt with.
If you instead find the hidden entrance first and enter the crypt that way, you'll only face the nightwraith as you near the flight of stairs out of the flooded room. You can proceed all the way back up and, on exiting the crypt, one woman will cry out in surprise, thinking you're a ghost. Their conversation is pretty much the same other than Geralt informing them he already dealt with the wraiths.
Whichever route was taken, the quest then completes (50) and the two women then head into the crypt.","No objectives appear if you used the hidden entrance to deal with the nightwraith.
Enter the tomb.
Kill the monsters on the lower level of the tomb.
Talk to the woman waiting outside. (50)"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Possession_(quest),Skellige,"This quest is given after speaking with Crach an Craite during the main quest The King is Dead – Long Live the King, who mentions his daughter, Cerys an Craite, went off to complete a feat worthy of becoming Skellige's new ruler and was under the impression Jarl Udalryk was under a curse, despite Crach believing this wasn't the case. Regardless, he hopes you'll convince her to come back home.
Head to Svorlag on Spikeroog to speak with Udalryk, who was in the middle of talking with his advisor Hjort about some strange dreams of his. Udalryk will eventually head off, leaving you to question Hjort alone. If you ask him about Cerys, he'll point to several possible villagers and the jarl's old family home, an abandoned, haunted structure overlooking the village. However, if you ask about the jarl's health, you'll be interrupted by Udalryk suddenly screaming and Hjort will leave to go see what's going on, leaving you to ask around the village about Cerys.
If you're left to ask around, you can find a man and woman just by the signpost of Svorlag who inform you Cerys was inquiring into the jarl's childhood so they directed her to Bergthora and Eiric, who were once close with Udalryk years ago. These are the same people Hjort would have pointed you towards if you inquired about Cerys. Head to their home to find Bergthora, who tells you Cerys went looking for Eiric on the beach, so follow the marker to find the man surrounded by several drowners. After killing them off for 400 , you have the option to ridicule him or use Axii (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35). Whichever you choose, he'll reveal that Cerys went to the jarl's old family home.
Finding Cerys[]
Enter the home and follow the footsteps to find a passed out Cerys and, after a short cutscene, the two will converse, with Cerys refusing to return home until she helps the ailing Udalryk. She then reveals the reason she went into the house was to find Udalryk's family sword Brokvar, which she believes will lift the curse on the jarl as, many years ago, the sword was given to Udalryk's younger brother, Aki, instead of following custom of going to the firstborn. Enraged, Udalryk then broke a sacred Skellige law by openly questioning his father's decision and was thus punished for several days. Afterwards, Udalryk took Aki out fishing to mend things between them but a storm hit and Aki fell overboard while Udalryk had his hands full with the sails and thus didn't notice until it was too late. However, others in the area believe Udalryk killed his brother on purpose.
Regardless, Cerys believes it's Aki's ghost that's troubling the jarl and if she could return the family sword to Aki then Udalryk would no longer be troubled. Despite some holes in this theory (like why it was the house being haunted and not the sea, or why Udalryk thinks it's the gods commanding self-harm and not Aki) go along with the plan and go back into the haunted house. In the back of the oven you'll find the cellar key and, on entering the cellar, find the sword on the only table here (400 ). Note to pay close attention to the walls/shadows when you get the sword.
Note: While exploring the house, breaking the wooden planks in the room behind the first door of the hallway opens a pathway to the Place of Power west of the house. This room is locked after the quest completes, so you may want to go take it now, although it's not that hard to climb your way there afterwards where the house's wall and rocks meet.
Head back to Cerys and the two will go talk to Udalryk to explain their theory, who will then point to the location where Aki drowned, just past Ulula's Needle.
Aki's grave[]
Head out to the location and, after dealing with some sirens, dive down to find Aki's remains and place Brokvar with the skeleton.
Note: The treasure hunt quest Not Only Eagles Dare takes place at this same location and can be completed during the same dive as placing the sword should Geralt first stop off on the nearby islet to start the task.
When finished in the area, return back to Udalryk to let him know. However, as you return (550 ) the jarl screams once more and it's revealed he poked one of his own eyes out as commanded by the gods' voices in his head, this time under the guilt of not sailing out himself to beg for Aki's forgiveness. As he talks about the voices some more, Geralt figures it out and eventually pulls Cerys aside to reveal it: the jarl is indeed haunted but by a very rare and dangerous creature known as a Hym, a shadowy being which latches onto a person's guilt and feeds off of it by making their host harm themselves.
Geralt will then reveal two ways to deal with it: the witcher's way or the less common method of tricking the hym. The former consists of fighting the hym in its lair, but would require the host to also be there, who may not last long enough for the hym to be killed. The latter consists of tricking the hym to latch onto a new host who believes they've committed a horrible deed, but then revealing no such deed was actually committed, thus forcing the hym to leave. However, successfully tricking the hym would require the intended recipient to not know they were being tricked. Your dialog choices here do not matter. After explaining the two choices to Cerys, she will immediately decide on the latter, though agrees to use the witcher's way as a backup. She heads back to the haunted house to look around some more before exclaiming she's figured out an idea, then asks that you trust her. It is at this point where you actually choose which method to use. Trusting Cerys will allow you to trick the hym. If not, you will use the witcher's method and fight the hym with Udalryk present.
Trick the Hym[]
Cerys hands the baby to Geralt
If you decide to trust her, she'll then run off and you'll have some time to prepare if you wish before starting the fire for the oven. A small cutscene starts where, several hours later, Cerys rushes in with the jarl's baby and immediately hands him to you as guards and an enraged Udalryk rush in after her and she orders you to throw the baby in the now hot oven. You'll have a timed reaction here to do what she says or hand the baby to the jarl.
If you do as Cerys asks, Geralt will seal the baby in the oven. You must then fight off the guards (750 ) as Udalryk tries in vain to save his baby. Once all the guards are knocked out, the hym latches onto Geralt's guilty conscience before Cerys has Hjort appear with the baby, safe and sound. Cerys then reveals the trick: she had Hjort wait on the other side of the oven to safely recover the baby but Geralt, not knowing this, was filled with despair at what he did. Now that he realizes he didn't do anything wrong, the hym has no guilty conscience to cling to and is summarily banished, finally freeing the jarl from his torment.
If, however, you handed the baby over to the jarl, Geralt will remark he wishes to do it the witcher's way but Udalryk will nevertheless punch you while Cerys reveals the, now foiled, plan she had intended. The quest will then follow the path like if you'd chosen to fight the hym.
The Witcher's Way[]
If you chose the witcher's way (either by not trusting Cerys or handing the baby over to the jarl), go talk to Udalryk to tell him about what's been going on with the hym and that you need him to visit his old family home to get rid of it. Hjort will back you up and give you the torches needed for the fight or, if you handed the baby over, send you to the shed to get them. When ready, head out and place the 4 torches and head just outside to talk to Udalryk to let him know it's ready. You can then advise him or not on what's going to happen before heading back in to light the torches.
During the ensuing fight, you'll need to also use Axii from time to time on Udalryk to calm him down, and eventually the hym will retreat to the cellar. Head down to finish the job and once dead (750 ) go talk with Udalryk to let him know it's finally over.
Freed[]
Whichever method you chose, Udalryk is finally free from the hym's torment. Cerys then states she'll remain for a little while to make sure of the jarl's recovery before finishing the quest.","Ask Udalryk where Cerys is.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Practicum_in_Advanced_Alchemy,Skellige,"This quest can be started several different ways:
talk to Otto Bamber at the Herbalist's Hut near Oxenfurt
talk to Yolar (the druid merchant) at Gedyneith
just happen across Gremist sitting outside his cave at Gedyneith
However you start it, go see Gremist, who's being chastised by another druid about how he should pass on his skills before it's too late but he'll just tell the druid to bug off. You can then talk to Gremist who will initially refuse no matter what you say, but will eventually relent and give you 3 tasks before he'll accept you as his apprentice:
Search for a pimpernel from the Morskogen Forest
Get a bottle of spirit from the old distillery on Hail Hill
Convince Fritjof, a vaedermakar druid in Blandare, to help perform the rite
You can ask him to elaborate on any of the tasks, but in short he won't reveal what he's planning, you just need to do the 3 tasks.
Find pimpernel[]
This is the only task out of the three that you could possibly have done beforehand if you found the cave while exploring, in which case you won't need to do this if you already gathered the pimpernel.
If you didn't get it though, head to the marker far south of the Druids' Camp to the Morskogen Forest and look for pimpernel, only to see the blooms have all been picked. As one is examined, a druid approaches and explains how Gremist has sent countless young druids to bring back pimpernel and they all returned with a blank look on their faces with no flower in hand. Furthermore, none of them ever speak of what happened to them. However, the latest one, Ramund, hasn't returned, so the druid came out to find him or kill the monster he believes is responsible.
Find the tracks, which will take you through a group of white wolves, before the tracks split on a path: one set going up hill and one set going down. Head downhill and Geralt and the druid will find an armored arachas near a neat pile of stones, under which is a dead body. Since the arachas may take time to kill, it may be better to find the grave, but when you do and examine it, the druid remarks that it's Jorre the White. Now head back up the hill and follow the tracks where eventually Geralt hears a male's voice. Turns out Ramund is safe and sound with a succubus, who resides in the area.
If Geralt didn't find the body, the succubus explains she hasn't harmed anyone and the young druids find her by themselves, to the point she has to use magic to send the unwanted admirers away. However, as Ramund is nice, she decided to let him stay. If Geralt found Jorre, the succubus will reason that he was very old and even when she warned him his heart was too weak to continue, he kept returning and died, so she buried him as custom dictates.
Convinced that the succubus uses bewitching charms, the older druid wants to kill her. Geralt can agree and kill her or stand down. If he agrees, the pair kill the succubus and Ramund becomes bitter about it. Geralt must then follow the scent to her lair, which she decorated with pimpernel flowers, and take one. If Geralt stood down, the older druid storms off, promising to bring someone willing to kill her. The succubus will then lead Geralt to her lair and allow him to take a pimpernel flower as repayment. Regardless how you obtain the flower, you'll earn 80 .
Important: If you decide to kill the succubus, note that prior to Patch 4.0 she was vulnerable to steel swords and not silver.
The distillery[]
While you might have been able to gather the necessary items for this one before starting this quest, it wouldn't have let you use the distillery until you actually agreed to help Gremist.
Head to the abandoned distillery on Hail Hill to find a cave inhabited by a cyclops where the distillery is located. There will be some alghouls just before the signpost if you haven't been there and killed them yet. After defeating the cyclops, look inside the small shack to find the Distiller's Log and the Distiller's letter detailing the instructions on how to distill the alcohol. There is one sample of mash left up on the scaffolding to the left of the machinery. To make the spirit:
put the mash in the evaporator (the center vat) and ignite the fire underneath to boil it
once Geralt remarks that should be enough, go to the levers and first use the right one, then left
Despite commenting to cool it down, this appears to have no effect on the outcome if you skip putting out the fire, nor does it ruin the alcohol if you pull the levers in the wrong order as long as you then pull the left after the right one is down.
Now retrieve the alcohol from the barrel next to the condenser, earning 80 .
Find Fritjof[]

Go to Blandare to find Fritjof, who's warning a villager about the dangers of the ritual he's about to perform. When approached, he explains the village is suffering from a drought and, as a vaedermakar, he can call forth rain, but at the cost of also summoning monsters. Agree to help him and he will lead you to an altar in a field where, once close enough, a cutscene starts and he will sacrifice a sheep and start the ritual, causing foglets to appear.
They'll appear in groups of 2 until you kill off the second group, after which 3-4 will appear at once. While Fritjof also has a health meter, they tend to ignore him. His wolf will also help you fight and is immune to damage, helping you if you're having difficulties. Once the third group of foglets are dead, Fritjof will finish the ritual then agree to go help Gremist, earning 80 .
Go see Gremist[]
Once all favors are completed, head back to Gremist. However, even though the old druid accepts Geralt as his official apprentice, he will still refuse to tell him about the ritual and instead tells Geralt he must wait a day while he and Fritjof conduct the ritual in his workshop.
Come back in 24 hours to find that the ""ritual"" was just the two old friends hanging out and getting drunk. While drunk, the master alchemist finally decides to teach Geralt all he knows about alchemy and drinking toxins. The quest finishes some time later, leaving Geralt a bit drunk as well and earning a final 80  plus a few alchemical ingredients.
After this, you may return to Gremist at any time to buy alchemy supplies and a large amount of Potion of Clearance. But more importantly, he's available to play for Gwent: Skellige Style.","Note: The order in which these objectives appear may differ depending on the order in which the locations are visited.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Shock_Therapy,Skellige,"Head to Gedyneith and, at a cave entrance to the west of the signpost, you'll find a druid calling you over. Talk to him and he'll tell you one of the druids, Egill, has suddenly gone mute and he needs your help to cure him. He'll then suggest using scare tactics or irritate him to do so, provided no harm comes to Egill.
With that, head over to where Egill is, who's labeled as the taciturn druid. You can try talking with him if you wish but, naturally, he won't say anything and will give a rather amusing answer with a finger instead. You can use your Witcher Senses to examine the area for 3 options:
destroy Egill's fire
hit the pots while Egill is sleeping
disturb a nearby hornet's nest
Note that you have to do everything in a particular order in relation to where Egill is and what he's doing.
If he's laying down on his mat, use Aard on the pots
If he's praying on the rock ledge, use Aard on the hornet's nest
If the fire is lit and he's warming himself at it, go up to it and extinguish it
After each instance he'll throw the middle finger at Geralt until the last one, where he'll yell at the witcher before suddenly realizing he broke his vow of silence. You can respond however you wish but he'll still be pissed and storms off to tell off the other druid. As you enter the cave and approach the original quest giver, he'll laugh at the joke and you can respond with whatever you like before being rewarded 75  and the Iorveth gwent card.","Go visit Egill.
Help Egill recover his voice by giving him a scare.
Keep trying to scare the druid until he recovers his voice. 3/3
Return to the druid who gave you the task."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Siren%27s_Call,Skellige,"Along the road west of Sund you'll find a shepherd and his sheep under attack by sirens. After saving the man, you can talk to him who'll reveal the sirens are coming from Undvik. The quest will then complete, giving you 50 .
While complete, a few days later you can run into the shepherd reuniting with his brother in Arinbjorn around the middle of the village (where one path splits to go up to the cliffs). On spotting you, they'll once more thank Geralt for his help.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land,Skellige,"After finishing the Contract: The Phantom of Eldberg and receiving payment from Jorund in the inn at Arinbjorn, Geralt is forced again to face Kori and Kraki with the help of Jorund, but this time in a fistfight.
No matter what you do, Geralt gets knocked out and before you can recover, Kori and Kraki draw swords and Jorund is lethally wounded. You need to finish them off then, after which Geralt goes to check on Jorund, but the only thing he can do is hear the man's last words. As you leave the tavern afterwards, Geralt is confronted by Leif - Kori and Kraki's father. You can argue for a bit, but are eventually taken to be judged by Madman Lugos and end up in his prison at Kaer Muire. (50)
When the scripted events and cutscenes end, you have the objective to get out of prison. If you talk to the guard by interacting with the grate door, you can learn that Geralt can stay quite awhile here, which is obviously not an acceptable option for him. Luckily, in the same conversation you have the immediate option to use Axii (requires Delusion level 3 for a minimum of 40) on the guy, and that is enough to take you to Lugos. However, there are two more options.
If you just walk around the place, a man at the bottom end of the prison, Simun Brambling, will draw your attention and offer to help by cashing in a favor the guard owes him. The only catch is, Geralt will then owe him a favor instead. If you accept, all you have to do is what Simun says - talk to the guard.
Note: Accepting help from Simun Brambling will unlock the secondary quest An Unpaid Debt after The Cave of Dreams is completed.
The least obvious option is to attack one of the prisoners, which starts a fistfight with all four of them, although Simun will stay back if you keep your distance from him. It's not a very hard fight as you can consume equipped food and potions, as well as use signs. Once you beat them all up, the guard will be impressed that such a strong guy is being wasted for slave labor in the prison and takes you for a fast trial.
Regardless of how, you walk in for your trial as Leif is advocating for a harsh judgement in front of Madman Lugos. It makes no difference what you say here - the jarl sentences Geralt to death unless he can buy his freedom with a ridiculous amount of silver, but then declares that he will himself pay the blood price for you. This is obvious theater by the Madman, but the reason why depends on whether you've completed another secondary quest yet.
If you haven't, he's putting Geralt in debt of honor and wants you to help his son ""Blueboy"" Lugos in his venture to The Cave of Dreams, starting the quest. If you have, he's simply repaying you for that. The quest then completes and 80 is awarded.","Defeat the warriors who picked a fight with you.
See what's happening outside. (50)
Get out of prison. (80)

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Taken_as_a_Lass,Skellige,"Met the brother first[]
If you find the warrior first, he'll be on the eastern coast of Ard Skellig, around the pier south of Redgill and will be under attack by two pirates. Help him out and he'll then reveal he's looking for his sister, Kurisu, who was kidnapped and if you happen to find her, to tell her to head home to Blandare (50 ).
Once done talking, head to the islet southwest of the main Hindarsfjall island to find the pirate ship surrounded by a large number of ekhidnae. Kill them off then you can do one of two things to advance the quest:
loot the chest on the wrecked ship for some notes
examine the bodies and the 2 items next to them
Whichever one you do (or both) they'll then indicate Freya's temple as your next location. As you enter the small alcove of the temple, you'll see Kurisu talking with a priestess. Talk to her and she'll tell you a bit of what happened but is happy to go back home. The quest will then complete and 75  will be awarded, though this typically won't appear until you've traveled far enough away from the temple, presumably when Kurisu leaves it.
Met the sister first[]
If you find the sister first at Freya's temple, the conversation will go about the same with her eventually stating she's happy to head back home, however no  is given in this case. You must then head out to eastern Ard Skellig to the same location mentioned above where her brother is to talk with him and where Geralt will reveal he ran into Kurisu already. The brother will then thank you, granting 75 .
Unfortunately, in both cases it doesn't seem that you can find the siblings anywhere after the quest.","If the quest is obtained from the warrior:
Find the pirate ship.
If you find the notes:
Read the note.
Look for Kurisu at Freya's temple.
Speak to Kurisu.
If Geralt encountered Kurisu first:
No objectives appear in the journal."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Cave_of_Dreams,Skellige,"You can start this quest on your own by finding Blueboy Lugos and his crew on a ship, near a cave far southeast of Holmstein's Port and Kaer Muire, but the location is quite remote and nothing else leads you there. It is more likely that Madman Lugos directs you to it after Stranger in a Strange Land, in which case you'll have a map marker to follow.
As you approach, Jorulf the Wolverine will stop you from boarding the ship. No matter what you say, Blueboy will overhear and allow you on, but you can use Axii (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35) for a bonus. When you speak to the jarl's son, you may have the option to tell him that his father sent you if that was the case, or simply suggest that he should hire a witcher for his dangerous endeavour. He'll take you on either way, but if Madman Lugos did send you and you don't tell him that, he'll get mad at you later. Say that you need to prepare first if you wish, but once you agree the whole group heads for the Cave of Dreams.
As you enter, they'll explain the challenge ahead and a short way inside, four nekker warriors are encountered. Once they are killed, everybody present consumes a mix of hallucinogenic herbs to enter a trance and the real challenge. (25) In the nightmare state, the crew is transported to a whole different cave filled with glowing, floating whales, fish, and markings on the walls and ceilings of the cave. Follow the quest markers one after another to face the ghosts of each crew members' greatest fears.
The first encounter is Uve Jabberjaw's fear - King Bran, for whom he cut his own tongue and lost the ability to speak. You'll have to defeat multiple of the King's warriors, rather annoying to deal with due to their fighting style, but nothing special. (50)
Next up is Jorulf's fear of sirens who had caused his father's death in a shipwreck by distracting him. There are only two weak sirens to kill before you can move on. (50) While en route to the next challenge, a water hag may appear, though it's easy to miss if you're just bolting ahead and your mates will easily deal with it alone.
The third is Blueboy's fear of his own father, who taunts him for shame experienced as a little child before attacking. The Madman's ghost is a bit more challenging as he swings a war hammer and incinerates anyone near enough to him, but is ultimately no match for a witcher. (50)
Finally then, Geralt reaches his own greatest fear - the King of the Wild Hunt, Eredin. He appears as a ghost of unknown level with a skull icon, supported by two hounds of the wild hunt and is a much more skilled warrior. Like the previous ghosts however, he is only a hallucination and as a result not actually that strong. Only half of his health has to be cut down before a cutscene triggers and Geralt is alone face to face with Eredin, who makes ominous promises of capturing Ciri. (80)
Just then, the nightmare visions end and Geralt wakes up. Blueboy Lugos will say different things depending on how you started the quest, including absolving you of the debt to his father if that was the case, and pays you 80  before leaving as the quest ends. (50)","Join Blueboy Lugos and his crew outside the Cave of Dreams.
Explore the Cave of Dreams with Blueboy Lugos.
Face your nightmares in the Cave of Dreams."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Family_Blade,Skellige,"Pick up this quest from Kaer Trolde Harbor's notice board about the stolen sword, then make your way to the the obelisk southwest of Miners' Camp to find a group of renegades leaving you no choice but to cut them down. Once done, loot one of the bodies for the Thief's journal and read it to learn your next location is Fort Grymmdjarr, which is southwest of Fyresdal.
At this next location are more bandits so make quick work of them and loot their bodies for yet another Thief's journal, this time pointing to the Whale Graveyard. Head there to deal with the last group of thieves and loot them for the third and final Thief's journal along with the stolen sword, Kuliu.
Now with the stolen sword in hand, head back to Kaer Trolde Harbor and speak with Olaf on the bridge who'll be very pleased you recovered it. He'll reward you with 20  and 75  and the quest will then complete.","Look for a thieves' camp near the obelisk.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Four_Faces_of_Hemdall,Skellige,"Northwest of Trottheim on Faroe Isle you'll come across a shrine being blocked by several pirates, who refuse to let a pilgrim pass unless they pay. Approach and a few choices can be made:
pay 20 . They'll make some remarks but ultimately let you and the pilgrim through without incident (also gives 2 )
threaten them (will lead to a fight)
be attacked (this happens if Hammond was killed during the secondary quest Following the Thread, in which case they'll recognize Geralt)
Regardless of how they're dealt with, the pilgrim will thank you and can tell you about Hemdall if you wish. You'll then earn 50  and the quest will end.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Heroes%27_Pursuits:_Fayrlund,Skellige,"On the road east-northeast of Fayrlund, and far south of the Rannvaig signpost, you'll find people getting ready to race. Talk to the race master here and he'll set up the race when you're ready.
This race is simple but short: you'll race along the road which at one point rides along the edge of the cliff and across a small bridge, before reaching the finish line on the other side of Fayrlund. The main kicker is to watch out for Red Rikka: she's clearly faster than your other opponent. However, she does make a few flaws that might give you enough room to get past her if you're having trouble.
Once you come in first, you'll gain 25 , 50 , and the Zerrikanian saddlebags.","Go to where the race starts.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Heroes%27_Pursuits:_For_the_Goddess%27_Glory!,Skellige,"This quest may be started at any of the Heroes' Pursuits horse race starts on Ard Skellig, by speaking to Svana, or finding the notice on Larvik's notice board in Hindarsfjall.
However you find it, the rules are simple: you must win at least each race once and it doesn't matter how you do it. Before you can compete in the championship against last year's winner, Astrid, you must win each of the following:
The Heroes' Pursuits: Kaer Trolde
The Heroes' Pursuits: Fayrlund
The Heroes' Pursuits: Fyresdal
After you win all of them, head back to Svana to let her know and you can then race against Astrid. This race will navigate towards Freya's Garden from the starting line at Larvik's western gate. Just be wary of a few sharp turns in the race, particularly near the garden. Also note that at the crossroads, while the path indicates you have to go into the sharp turn, you can cut through using the path right before it. The good thing is, even if you lose, you can keep racing against Astrid until you win.
Once you win the race, Svana will reward you with the Zerrikanian saddle along with 50  and 90 .","If Geralt found the notice:
Talk to Svana the priestess about the Heroes' Dash.
Win each of the qualifying races at least once.
Go to the race's starting line.
Be the first past the finish line.

The race is simple enough: there's no obstacles, just a race along the roads to Kaer Trolde's gate. However, you do need to win the race as part of the Heroes' Pursuits to do the final race.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Last_Wish_(quest),Skellige,"Dangerous Sometimes. Malicious All the Time[]
After finding Skjall in the well of Freya's Garden, and speaking about locating (and finding) Ciri, Yennefer requests you meet her in Larvik, at the warrior's hall. She has something important to tell you. You can accompany her to Larvik immediately (on horseback), or agree to meet her there later.
Enter the warrior's hall, where Yennefer is gaining the upper hand on some unruly yokels. Speak to her, and she mentions a mage named Amos var Ypsis, a specialist on djinns. She tells the story of his disappearance. Answer how you wish. She wishes to know what became of him, but she's particularly interested in his djinn. Feel free to ask more about these mystical creatures, before agreeing to help
The harbor is a short jog from the warrior's hall, down the hill to where her vessel is moored. Speak to her again. She tells you of an incantation on her boat, allowing you to see if there are any wrecks on the seafloor. Yennefer takes the helm. You sit at the bow of the boat.
You set sail into the ocean waters, talking of past adventurers. Eventually you reach an area that Yennefer wishes to search. She casts a spell to slow your heart, allowing you more breathing room. Leap into the frigid waters, and dive directly below the boat. If any sirens are in the vicinity, attack them with your crossbow or signs before you go.
Below are the remains of a longship, and a few swimming drowners. Avoid them as you find the entrance to an underwater cavern, or use your crossbow and remove them as a threat, and swim inside (roughly east). Use your Witcher Senses on the small half-buried vessel—it sports a Clan Drummond figurehead. This isn't the correct boat, so swim back to the surface. Yennefer sails roughly northwest, crossing the ocean toward a pair of small, odd islands of thin fur trees and rocks. Before you reach there, watch for the white whale if you wish.
She then stops and finds another wreck. Dive down and discover a variety of chests and barrels. By the rocks and ship's deck, you find a war horn bearing the Clan Heymaey symbols. Check for further chests, and gather all the war booty you can from them. There's also a Skelliger's buckler from ages past, but this isn't Yennefer's boat, so return to the surface.
Yennefer continues to travel towards the two islands that make up Ingdalen Isle. As she passes between the rocks, she senses something odd. Dive down under her boat, to discover a huge crater. However, when Yennefer uses your eyes to see this unnatural seafloor, she informs you this anomaly is the effect of teleportation. Now swim toward a collection of chests and crates (which can be looted), before finding the remains of a boat, which next to lies a broken seal, which Yennefer will order you to grab and return to the surface. (50  for giving Yen the seal)
The Other Half of the Ship[]
After examining the broken seal, Yennefer opens a portal and teleports you both to within a dozen yards of the other half of the seal. You appear atop a snow-covered mountain in Ard Skellig. Before continuing, quiz Yennefer regarding exactly why she wants a djinn. Choose either conversation. The topic soon changes to the link you and Yennefer share. She reminds you of the time you asked a djinn to bind you both together. Yennefer wants to ask this one to take that wish back.

Agree or don't. Yennefer wants to know if there's any magic left between you. Take that comment as you wish. You then head towards a ship, left atop the mountains of northern Ard Skellig, northwest of Yustianna's Grotto. Approach the wrecked vessel, looting the captain's cabin of treasure if you wish. Then continue down into the hull for more chests. The place looks like a laboratory. Gather some rare books, then inspect the following:
• A trail of blood from a pair of shoes. They lead to a bookcase. Interact with it, and you lift it up, revealing the crushed and bloodied remains of Amos. An unfortunate accident? Tell her you must search the body. You produce the other half of the seal. Head back up on the top deck.
Up at the ship's wheel, Yennefer aims to conjure and tame the djinn. It appears, but is too powerful to control. Leap down to the deck and attack the djinn, rolling in and using the central mast to avoid its electrical discharges. Whittle its health down until it weakens.
Yennefer captures the djinn, and bargains with it to remove the magic coupling you both in return for its freedom. It obliges. Afterwards, you both sit, and contemplate your triumph. You can:
Comment using language that is friendly and pleasant.
Answer using words that are more standoffish.
Yennfer tells you she was expecting to feel different. But nothing has changed. Answer:

Agree, telling her you love her. You embrace and kiss on the boat. Just like your first. Then you watch the mountains. Afterwards, you return to Yennefer's bedroom in Kaer Trolde.
Disagree, telling her you don't want to be with her any more. Yennefer is shocked, and you agree to a more formal friendship instead of romance.
Spoiler: if you chose to romance Triss during Now or Never, and you chose to romance Yennefer during this quest, you will lose them both.
Afterwards, it is agreed that Ciri should be found, but you aren't happy at Yennefer's insistence that the emperor should receive a report. Agree or disagree with her request—it is decided either way. If you have completed your searching of Velen and Novigrad, you decide Uma is important, and you must now head to see the Baron, collect Uma, and ride for Kaer Morhen. Your paths will intertwine again, as this quest concludes. (50)[1]
Note: Normally Yennefer would remain in The New Port until you leave the area, giving you time to converse with her on a few topics. However, with Patch 4.0 installed she leaves immediately.","Meet Yennefer in Larvik.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lord_of_Undvik,Skellige,"Before you set out to Undvik you should go to The New Port inn to get extra info on how to reach the island. You don't actually need to do this, but it's still a mission objective. Speaking just to Tante and Javor there is enough to complete it. However, if you also speak to Axel you will get extra information about the Jarl of Undvik, allowing Geralt to recognize him later and unlocking extra conversation options with him.
When you're ready, if you've bought The Lonesome World Guide to Undvik, then you may simply fast travel to Marlin Coast, otherwise you have to get on a boat. Sail there manually or use a fast travel harbor if you've been nearby before.
Note: This island can be approached from any direction. You aren't required to go to the location marker on the northern coast. Coming close to the island from any direction triggers the completion of the objective Sail to the island of Undvik and search for Hjalmar. long before you can get to the location shown on the map. A new objective marker in the middle of the island appears and the prior one is gone. Make a note of the first location or set a custom marker of the objective so you can investigate that initial area.
Note: By approaching through the northeast coast of the island, you'll be awarded 100 for this objective, since this is the way Tante and Javor advised you to proceed when talking to them at the Inn. If you want to make sure you get the , save before approaching the coast of the island so you can be in the northeastern coast area. This way you can reload if you approach the coast and no  is given. Fast travelling to Marlin Coast or either harbor on the northeast coast will give the , but approaching the island away from the northeastern coast only completes the objective without reward.
Keep in mind that this quest is long especially if you wish to save every survivor, so feel free to take your time to explore the island while at it, as you'll have to search most of it anyway. If you made shore on the northern part of the island, it's easier to move southeast to the nearest village on the island - Marlin Coast, at least to get its signpost tagged. However, the intended path if you want to examine everything is directly south from Undvik Boatyards. Along the way you may find some graves and shields with the an Craite clan symbols. Now follow the main path uphill from whichever point you chose, both converge at a broken bridge over a deep ravine. If you are uncertain which way then use your minimap and it will lead you toward your quest marker. Eventually you will reach a point where a cutscene will play in which the ice giant is feeding raw meat to the sirens and someone inside the nearby ship. After the cutscene you will have the option to explore the ship or move on.
The Stranger[]
Entrance to the Ship
Once you get close to the ship you will hear singing and you may have to kill a couple of sirens. Then climb inside through the opening, where you will meet an old man named Octo. The entrance may be hard to spot - stay on the eastern side of the ship and light a torch if you have to. Talk to the man and if you spoke to Axel back at the Inn, you can discover his true identity. Apparently he is a bit mad as he says he and the Sirens are preparing the boat for the giant before his battle with the gods and the meat the giant feeds them is from all the humans it has slain. After asking about Hjalmar and obtaining directions to the camp, he will ask for some twine and nails. The ""twine"" is entirely bugged and the quest always works as if you found it, but the nails you have to find are a quest item and will have white sparkles coming off of them. If you already have the quest nails, you can give them to Octo in this conversation. Otherwise you will have to go looking for them after the conversation is over.
Tip: There are actually some nails nearby. Exit the boat and just north toward the barricade you will find some boards to the left that contain them. You may have already picked up a set of nails in some boards outside the wooden barricade as well. Pick them up and go back to Octo to speak with him to deliver the items he wants (200 ).
Once you are finished exploring the area with the boat, you can follow the marker to the next area. Before reaching the destination, you can actually skip all other optional parts of the mission with ease. If you wish to do that, then beeline for the lake to the south in whatever way you find convenient, and from there on it's just a matter of walking east to Dorve Ruins, where you'll find Hjalmar, skipping all the next few sections. Obviously though, you'd be missing out on a lot. Back onto following the quest objective, you will reach a camp that looks more like a morgue, with many bodies around. Use your witcher senses to examine the place and you will have two tracks to follow - footsteps and tracks left by a boat being pulled.
Troll Soup[]
Following the footsteps you will find a dead nekker and some arrows along the way, later some more dead nekkers and eventually the trail will take you to the Abandoned Village. Now keep following the trail north and they will take you to a body, and to the left of it you can find the hornwall horn - a very useful item, though not immediately necessary and you'll get back here again. Nearby you will also find more footprints, both troll ones and the archer's, that will lead you into a cave.
Inside the cave you will encounter ice trolls, one at each branch of the tunnels, but you may only have to deal with one if you follow the tail of blood. While on the right track, eventually Geralt will make a remark about something getting cooked and after climbing a ledge you will hear some trolls talking about soup. Once close enough, Geralt will start conversing with the trolls. They are cooking the archer who will yell to you for help and you can either kill the trolls or decide to play a guessing game with them.
The answer to the troll's first riddle is ""troll"". The trolls are then unable to answer Geralt's riddle and the archer is freed. If you answered incorrectly, you are able to play a second round. The second riddle's correct answer is ""rocks"". However, if you answer the second riddle incorrectly it will be too late to save the archer.
The man you saved either way is Folan and he may ask you about Cerys. Geralt will have a more substantive response if you already completed Possession, but regardless you need to ask him about Hjalmar and the rest of the company. After the conversation he will join you and help with his bow. (200) Now go back to the camp to follow the other trail.
Note: Saving Folan makes him a potential ally for The Battle of Kaer Morhen.
The boat trail[]
Following the drag trail you will eventually find the boat and a dead body just at the edge of Urskar. At this point you may have the objective to cross the lake to the east (particularly if you examined the boat) and doing so is effectively a shortcut, as the path on the other end will lead you to Hjalmar and you eventually get there anyway. If you choose this route, there may be a couple of wraiths on the shoreline path, and further ahead some pirates associated with the aptly named treasure hunt quest Shortcut. However, if you wish to complete all objectives, head into the village.
What happened to the crew[]
In Urskar you will find a few more clues to examine, including footsteps leading to a cliff edge inside a cave. Approach the cliff and Geralt will remark that the lake below appears deep enough that it would be safe to jump in. Dive into the subterranean lake, and make your way out of the cave by following the trail up, dealing with any erynias nearby. While traversing, you will find a body and if Folan is with you he will identify it as ""Thorsten."" Now climb the wall near him and keep going along your new path. Soon you will find the body of ""Arvid an Tordarroch,"" after which climb the next wall. Eventually you will find a chamber containing a tree and a lot of harpies guarding it. Folan will start shooting there and you can can kill them if you want to loot the area (there are some in the waters below too), but that's not necessary. Use the ladder just around the left corner from where you came to reach a mine corridor. You will have to deal with a few devourers there before arriving at Clan Tordarroch Forge on the other end.
Note: This is the place you need to reach to find the tools required for Master Armorers so feel free to do that now.
Enter the house and a cutscene will play where you find the scene of a massacre, but if Folan is with you he will comment that none of the bodies belong to Hjalmar. A devourer is then seen running into a room and you can go investigate that if you wish, but keep in mind that there are multiple of them in a very tight space, so this can be tough. It's easy to just run past them and through the broken wall on the other end of the building where you will see footsteps. One set are the giant's, but follow the human ones when the two eventually split. You will soon find yourself on the path which the lake crossing would've lead to and your quest markers will update as you reach Dorve Ruins.
Hjalmar[]
At the ruined settlement you find Hjalmar fighting a couple of sirens. Kill them off and a conversation will begin, with Folan taking part too if you rescued him. At the end of the conversation, you set off together to find the giant. If you don't stay close Hjalmar will comment that he'll await you ahead at the cave entrance, but don't worry about that - this quest is buggy all around, but nothing fails here.
Note: If you have not found the nails the Stranger required before, you can find some right here if explore the town and if you wish to deliver them you should do it now. You can also find a skeleton that has a map and key as part of Ruins, Hidden Treasure, You Know... so you can do that too. You can also pick up the Diagram: Mastercrafted Wolven boots in the broken tower at the southeast end of the Dorve Ruins.
The Giant and the Loon[]
Once you reach the lair a cutscene will play where Geralt and Hjalmar clear a path. After that go inside and reach your main goal. The giant is sleeping, but you will also find Vigi the Loon in a cage, asking you to free him. Hjalmar will tell you to leave him there, but you can free him even if you agree. To do so, you need to avoid walking on snow until you free Vigi, or the giant will wake up and kill him. Also, don't try to pre-cast Quen as that seems to wake him up too. If you succeed, the Loon will join the fight, but as his name implies instantly charges at the giant and kicks him. (200)
Note: If Vigi survives, he will also be able to join you for The Battle of Kaer Morhen.
Regardless, it's time to fight the giant. Prepare yourself with ogroid oil and whatever else you need. After the giant is down by about 33% a cutscene will play where it knocks Geralt away and picks up an anchor as a weapon.
Note: Prior to Patch 4.0, even with manual sword drawing enabled, Geralt will draw his steel sword, both at the start of the fight and again when the giant knocks him down and picks up the anchor.
The giant obviously hits hard, so try to keep your Quen up at all times. Launch your attacks after he swings the anchor and it gets stuck in the ground. After he is dead (100), the quest ends and another conversation begins, at the end of which another 50 will be awarded if you rescued Folan and kept him alive.
Hjalmar will say he'll make sure everyone hears about Geralt's victory over the giant, which you can choose to accept or tell him to take the glory. Note: If Geralt accepts the praise, he will receive a 10% discount with all merchants in Skellige. It doesn't matter if any of the optional objectives are completed, only this one dialogue choice matters.
Either way, you will now have the choice to stay or go with him/them. (500) If you stay for the loot, he/they will be waiting at the harbor and you can later meet Hjalmar in Marlin Coast. If you talk to him there, it's only an unimportant conversation about his return to Ard Skellig and various dialogue options about his sister, depending on whether you've helped her during Possession. You can also go back and inform the Stranger that the Giant is dead if you wish, but at this point it's too late to get  for giving him nails.","Ask Crach an Craite about Hjalmar.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Nithing,Skellige,"This quest can be picked up from either Rannvaig's notice board or by heading further southeast to Lothar's hut and speaking directly with him.
However you arrive at it, he'll reveal someone planted a nithing just outside his home: the mark of a deadly curse targeted at his young son, Tjalve. Geralt will then reveal 2 ways to undo it and save the boy: either get the caster to remove the curse or Geralt can reverse the curse onto the caster, but he needs to know who cast it first. Lothar is adamant though that he's done no harm to anyone so you'll have to investigate into this if you wish to help.
If you choose to help, examine the nithing then follow the tracks until you find a skellige shawl with a clear scent trail. This will eventually lead you to Rannvaig, but then it fades off so you'll have to ask around about it. Head towards the harbor to find an unnamed Skelliger woman during the daytime and talk to her, who'll reveal that it belongs to the herbalist Jonna.
Talk to Jonna and she'll admit she planted it, revealing she did it for her dignity: she and Lothar used to be together for 10 years when he suddenly left her without a word and married someone else, making the whole village remark how Jonna had been ""had"". She'll then agree to lift the curse but for a steep price: Lothar must return to her and denounce his son, which would strip his wife and children of honor and condemn them to poverty. Go back to Lothar and let him know the deal and he'll be upset and all but demand Geralt to turn the curse on Jonna instead. You must now make your choice.
If you wish to not kill Jonna, Lothar will reluctantly agree to go back to her to save his son and will say goodbye to his family, finishing the quest. You can later see that when he does arrive in town, Jonna tries to tell him he'll soon forget about them and she'd bear him healthy sons but Lothar tells her off point blank he only agreed to return to her, not to love her.
If you instead agree to turn the curse on Jonna, interact with the nithing and her name will be carved on the shaft and the skull will be turned around, aiming towards Jonna. Go talk to Lothar to let him know it's done and he'll pay you before asking if you'll stay for dinner, though Geralt declines, completing the quest. A short time later Jonna disappears from the game.","Talk to Lothar.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Path_of_Warriors,Skellige,"This quest can be started 2 ways on An Skellig:
talk to the Skellige women in the center of Urialla Harbor
talk to Gunnar at the Trail to Yngvar's Fang
However you pick it up, go to the Trail to Yngvar's Fang to talk to Gunnar. He'll essentially think little of a foreigner being able to complete the trail but will tell you about it, revealing you must complete 2 parts: reach the top of the mountain and retrieve the token there, then enter the cave and retrieve something at the end of it and bring the items back to him.
To start, simply continue past Gunnar along the trail to the mountain top, Yngvar's Fang, where soon enough you'll come across a harpy and a couple sirens. Kill them off, then continue along the path but be careful as more sirens will attack as you make your way higher along the path. Eventually you'll reach a part of the path where you see an impossible jump to some broken stairs on the other side. Simply slide down to the path below and make your way to the ruins at the end and climb your way up to re-connect with the path. Note that at anytime you miss a jump, most cases you'll slide down to a section that can take you back to the previous ""checkpoint"". Note: A portion of Scavenger Hunt: Bear School Gear can be done in the structure you encounter after the slide, if not previously completed.
As you near the end of the mountain path you'll pass a man outside his hut, who also thinks little of you trying to do the path. Ignore him and continue climbing. Depending how fast or slow you go, you may encounter a couple harpies here before you reach the very top. Once you do reach the mountain peak, loot the totem pole for the token and 50 . You can also get the Place of Power here (Quen) if you haven't already done so.
With the first token in hand, take the other path down where you'll slide all the way to the next part, the cave path. Achievement note: this slide is one of the easiest ways to get the Hearts of Stone expansion achievement, Rad Steez, Bro!.
Enter the cave and prepare for a very long swim, so it might be useful to use Killer Whale here. Once you get through the first long tunnel you can come up for air, then continue swimming straight and get ready to dive into the next. Note that while there is land here that you can climb on, the token isn't here, only 2 gargoyles. The next token is about 3/4 of the way through the second tunnel and, once looted, continue to the end then climb your way out. Note that there are several bandits just outside this cave, so if you don't want to deal with them, you can swim back out the way you came.
However you get out of the cave, go back to talk to Gunnar who'll be impressed. The quest will then end, gaining 50  and earning a couple items, namely Diagram: Assault gauntlets.","Talk to the man who oversees the Path.
Reach the start of the Path.
Collect proof you made it to the top of the peak.
Descend down to the cave entrance.
Travel through the tunnel and collect proof you made it to the end.
Reach the end of the tunnel.
Leave the caverns and talk to the man who oversees the Path."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Price_of_Honor,Skellige,"In the village of Harviken on Faroe Isle, a man named Timmon will call out by the docks and will explain that his brothers, Mikkel and Ulf, have not yet returned from fetching his betrothed bride, Agda, from Hindarsfjall and the wedding day is approaching. He'll ask you to go check for him while he finishes the wedding preparations. If you agree to help him, you'll have to travel to the far northeastern end of Faroe Isle.
Note: depending on whether you've done the quests Flesh for Sale and/or Following the Thread, you may have to avoid fast travelling to Trottheim because of the hostile pirates there.
Once at the place and having dealt with a couple of sirens guarding the area, search the shores to find the dead body of a woman. You then have to use Keira's magic lamp on the dead body to see two ghosts crying over her whilst pleading to Freya for forgiveness for letting their brother's betrothed die under their watch, and her dowry lost after a storm beset them.
You can then follow the ghosts' footprints further east to a tree to find the dead brothers, having committed suicide to preserve their honor rather than face their brother with the news. On one of the deceased bodies you can find a key and a letter. The letter suggests that there's a dowry to be found, but doesn't actually give an objective for it. From here, you can return to Timmon or dive in where the ship wrecked just off the coast from Agda's body. If you do the latter, you can unlock the chest there for a gold diamond necklace.
Return to Timmon and give him the bad news. If you retrieved the dowry, you will also have the chance to return it or lie and keep it for yourself with no penalty. The quest will then complete. (75)","Examine the coasts of Faroe on the side facing Hindarsfjall.
Search the shore using your Witcher Senses.
If Geralt doesn't have Keira's magic lamp:​
Return to this place once you have found another way to examine it.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sad_Tale_of_the_Grossbart_Brothers,Skellige,"Go to Blandare where, near the signpost, a Skelliger named Djenge Frett calls out to you. Talk to him and he proposes an idea: the two of you work together and take out the Grossbart Brothers, a trio of brothers who rape and murder however they see fit. If you haven't come across the brothers yet, he'll bid you farewell and perhaps you'll meet again.
If you already found and killed the brothers, when you talk with Djenge he'll be pleased and gives you half the bounty once you point him towards where the bodies are, netting you 20  and 50 . However no quest log will appear.
If you didn't take out the brothers yet, head to Grotto on the southeast part of Ard Skellig and enter the cave. As you make your way around the right path, you'll bump into Djenge who'll ask if you've decided to team up with him. You can say yes or no. Note that unless you agree, the quest will fail regardless what you do next.
If you agree, head further into the cave to find the three brothers. Important: if you teamed up, you must keep Djenge alive or else the quest will fail. He is also not great at surviving, so before he charges for the cave ahead you might want to Axii him and deal with the brothers alone. Once all three are dead Djenge will talk with you before rewarding you with 25  and 50 , finishing the quest.
If you tell Djenge no, he'll make his own way into the cave to deal with the brothers and, if left on his own, will likely be killed by them, failing the quest (even if you told him you weren't interested). If you want to complete the quest, let Djenge get to the brothers first and engage with them in combat before jumping in and saving him. If you get to the brothers and start fighting before Djenge does, the quest can fail even if he also joins the battle with them and lives.","Look for the Grossbart brothers in southern Ard Skellig.
Help the bounty hunter deal with the Grossbart brothers."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Tower_Outta_Nowheres,Skellige,"Head to Urialla Harbor on An Skellig to find it's raining nonstop. As soon as you arrive, you'll also overhear several men in the center of town talking about a tower causing the bad weather and, once you get close enough, they'll spot you and call you over.
Talk to them and one will lead you off, explaining how the tower appeared out of nowhere and with it, the nonstop rain. Several of their men went inside with a druid to investigate but haven't been seen since.
Head out and enter the tower to find right down the stairs what the man had been talking about earlier: a portal. Head through it and you'll come out into another part of the presumed tower, but the portal you used immediately disappears as you hear and see a golem in the central part of the chamber while a voice announces an intruder, that is to say, you. The golem will then hone in on you so naturally you'll need to kill it off before investigating further.
Once dead, a man behind the barrier to the left when you entered will call to you, but you can examine the body in the middle of the room or near the man's archway first to find what happened to the earlier party. Now go and talk to the mage, who reveals himself as Sigo Buntz, and that the tower is outfitted with a Defensive Regulatory Magicon (DRM), so only the (now deceased) owner could use it. Before the new owner could disable it, it'd sealed off the rooms, summoned the golem, and, unknown to Sigo, teleported the tower from Kovir to Skellige. Turns out a side effect of the teleportation was the rain, so you'll need to find a way to get the tower back home. Sigo will then inform you that you must find the previous owner's Gottfried's Omni-opening Grimoire, which will help Sigo disable the DRM. You can talk with him to learn more about him, the tower, and the earlier party and, once done, he'll use a spell to open the portal across from him so you can try to find the grimoire.
Enter the new area which is flooded, and swim until you find two submerged archways, then go to the room on the left. Just as you get onto solid ground, DRM activates and will start to summon monsters after each one is killed as follows: 3 alghouls, a gargoyle, an ulfhedinn (mislabeled as ""Werewolf""), and finally, a non-violent cow. Once the hostile creatures are dead, you can now safely loot the key to library from the chest on the table. You can also examine the remains of another one of the missing Skelligers in the center area, where the monsters were being summoned.
With key in hand, head back out and this time go to the other archway to unlock the library's door. Before you start examining the books here, it's best to loot anything and examine the body here as, when you find the right book, the DRM will kick in again. When ready, examine the books to find GOG and the room will start to fill with gas. Thankfully it's only limited to that room so just go back out to the flooded passageway.
Go back to Sigo and he'll be able to remove the barrier to the room he was in before stating the hardest part was to come: the tower will throw everything at you in the final area while Sigo tries to disable the DRM. You can tell him you need time to prepare or go for it here.
In the final room you'll face an earth elemental in addition to occasional electrical shocks from the room's floor. While these shocks are meant to harm you, if positioned right you can also use them to harm the elemental. Once it's dead, talk to Sigo who'll thank you and give you Moonblade before teleporting the tower back to Kovir, but not before teleporting you back to Urialla Harbor, right into the ocean.
Note: Before you talk to Sigo, make sure you've looted everything you wanted, as you'll never come back here again. A chest in this final room always has Maugrim, while one by the entrance portal and two in the room with the key can have diagrams. If you weren't able to loot everything in the library before you set off the gas, you can go back there and it will be clear now too.
Swim back to the village and, once close enough, the villagers will thank you and offer you a reward. You can accept it for an additional 65  or inform them Sigo already paid you. Regardless they'll thank you and walk off save for one: he'll ask if you saw his brother while in the tower. You can tell him the truth, in which case he'll be sad at the news, or lie and he'll hope that his brother survived somehow. Regardless, the quest will then complete for 50 .","Talk to the villagers.

However, if you try to talk to him he'll suddenly call out to 2 others in hiding behind the Palisade, undoubtedly looking to rob and kill you. Simply kill them off to finish the quest.
Note that you can also simply bypass the ""wounded"" peasant altogether: if you do and go through the Palisade, all 3 will automatically become hostile as you've spotted the hiding men.","This quest has no journal objectives.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Worthy_of_Trust,Skellige,"This quest is started at Kaer Trolde Harbor by speaking to a Skelliger man on the docks. He identifies as Johann Bohner and asks Geralt for a loan, having been shipwrecked and left with no money for his trip back home to Novigrad. The man promises to pay back every last copper should Geralt pay him a visit in Novigrad's port district. You may give him the loan of 150  or refuse.
If given the loan, about a day later the man travels south of Kaer Trolde Harbor to the unmarked trading post between Kaer Trolde Harbor and the Crossroads signpost. This time he is posing as a wandering juggler from occupied Temeria but starts to fluster when Geralt questions him and finally admits he's a swindler. He then pleads for you to not turn him in to the jarl and promises to pay you back with interest in return. You can either agree to his terms, turn him in, or attack him. If you choose any but the option to let him go, he'll resist and you must attack him. At this point the quest ends, though one can loot his body afterwards to get back the 150 . Otherwise, if let go, Geralt will receive 20 .
If let go, the Skelliger can be encountered about a day later in the village of Fyresdal. Here, the witcher's patience is rewarded, as the swindler pays back the loan as promised plus interest, for a total of 200 , resulting in a net gain of 70  all total. For completing this quest you receive 50 , which are not affected by ±5 level constraint and difficulty level.","If Geralt decided to attack or try and turn him in:

Never Trust Children"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Yustianna_Disturbed,Skellige,"Head to Yustianna's Grotto in northern Ard Skellig and after you enter the cave, take the right path to eventually overhear some bandits talking in a central chamber. Note: if you take the left path and use The Eye of Nehaleni, you won't get the option to converse with the bandits like outlined below.
While initially marked as friendly, if you get close one of them will all but threaten you and you can either do the following:
pay him 150 
cast Axii (Requires Delusion level 2, earning 35 )
attack them
If you choose any but the last one, you'll be transported back to the area at the entrance of the cave. If you chose to attack them (or head back after paying or using Axii) they'll become hostile and you must kill all 4 of them off if you wish to explore the central chamber.
Whatever you choose, the quest will finish. If you attacked the bandits, you can further explore the main area to find the highwaymen's journal on one of the bandits, and a lot of loot. Many of the chests can contain random relic items and diagrams, and one of them has a second copy of the highwaymen's journal.
If you also have the Eye of Nehaleni, you can further explore the other hidden part of the cave for a few more lootable crates.",This quest has no journal objectives.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Berengar%27s_Blade,Kaer_Morhen,"To start the quest, find Berengar's notes near the western wall of Kaer Morhen. They're in a chest inside the ruins of a cell-like room, in the middle courtyard and to the west of the grindstone.
After reading them Geralt will decide it's best to consult Vesemir, so do just that. Vesemir will tell Geralt a story on how Berengar tried to craft the sword, but lost the diagram during the fight with a chort he had to retreat from. After that he will tell Geralt where is the cave the fight took place. As Vesemir tells you the best way to reach it is by the river.
Once there the quest will update and you can start exploring the cave. Eventually, you will see the Chort and be forced to fight it when you get close. When it's dead, search the rest of the cave and you will find the diagram inside a bag and the quest completes. (50)
Note: behind some stalagmites in the same cave, you will also find Diagram: Superior Wolven boots. As this is a remote location, don't forget to do that so you don't have to come back later.","Read Berengar's notes.
Talk to Vesemir.
Head down the river to the chort's cave.
Explore the cave using your Witcher Senses.
Kill the chort.
Look for a silver sword in the cave using your Witcher Senses. (50)"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Greenhouse_Effect,Kaer_Morhen,"This quest can be obtained by observing an unnatural weather effect in the southeast corner of the Kaer Morhen valley. The site is not easily visible on the map, although fragments of the road which lead to it can be seen. It can be reached by heading south from Kaer Morhen, across the river, up the hill to the left (passing through an old distillery), and then eastward as far as possible. It is east of the site where you meet Eskel in the quest To Bait a Forktail... (which has you exit the area to the south instead).
Once you have found the site, you need to look around with your witcher senses. The strange weather is arising from the decay of an old heat-generating spell, which served as a magical ""greenhouse"" for the production of exotic herbs. To fix it, you have to find the original mage's notes, which requires using The Eye of Nehaleni on an illusionary rock. You must then hit two of the three obelisks with the Igni sign and the remaining one with the Aard sign. However, a chort which appreciated the broken weather then appears and attacks. With the chort dead and the weather anomaly resolved, the ""greenhouse"" resumes its original function, and you can complete the quest a few days later by returning to the site (which now has a substantial crop of herbs, including Crow's eye, Fool's parsley leaves, Ginatia petals, Han fiber, Honeysuckle, Hornwort, Longrube, Mandrake, Pringrape, Ribleaf, Verbena, White myrtle petals, and Wolfsbane).
Note: You don't have to return days later as the objective suggests. If you leave the area (such as travelling down the hill a bit) and return, you will find that the herbs have grown and the objective completes.","Investigate the weather anomaly using your Witcher Senses.
Read the mage's letter.
Use the obelisks to restore the place's proper microclimate.
Kill the chort.
Return to the site of the anomaly in a few days. (25)"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Slayer,Kaer_Morhen,"This quest can be obtained by traveling to Lakeside Hut and to the right side the hut by inspecting the dead drowner's body. Once inspected, keeping on moving up and inspecting the dead drowner's bodies until you find a cave to the right.
Note: On the edge of the small island just before the cave, you can also pick up the Enhanced Wolven trousers diagram.
Upon entering the cave, an ancient rock troll will attack you. Once the troll is defeated, look around with your witcher senses and you will find an old letter which reveals details to the original plan to attack Kaer Morhen.","Use your Witcher Senses to find out what's killing drowners near the lake.
Kill the troll.
Search the troll's lair.
Read the letter. (50)"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Bastion,Kaer_Morhen,"You'll find the Bastion west of Kaer Morhen, if you are doing Scavenger Hunt: Wolf School Gear you'll be directed there in search of the Diagram: Wolven steel sword.
The Bastion will contain wraiths so be on your guard. After killing all the wraiths, use the magic lamp to find 5 locations where the lamp can be used. It can be hard to see the spots with the sun shining, so you may want to meditate until night time.
There is 1 on the ground level, 3 on the second level and 1 inside a ruined tower where you'll find the bones of a young witcher trainee who was stabbed with a pitchfork. The first 4 will show images of the boy's training days, and seeing them will give the objective to find his remains.
To reach the tower where the remains are found, you'll need to climb on the wall using a ladder located on the eastern wall. There you can see the last lamp projection as well, showing the boy's witcher instructor tell him and other trainees to hide there. When you pick up the remains, more wraiths will spawn below. The ladder can be particularly tricky to use downwards though, so be careful not to fall. If you must, drop down without using the ladder, but to avoid fall damage, do it exactly at the slightly elevated spot where it is located.
Once the wraiths are dealt with, go to the marked location to bury the remains and the quest will finish and advance you to the morning time.","Eliminate the wraiths haunting the old bastion.
Explore the old bastion near Kaer Morhen using your Witcher Senses.
Use Keira's lamp to investigate the old bastion.
Look for the boy's remains around the bastion using your Witcher Senses.
Use Keira's lamp to find out what happened to the boy.
Pick up the boy's remains.
Bury the boy's remains.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witchers%27_Forge,Kaer_Morhen,"The quest is started by reading Monstrum, or a Portrayal of Witchers. Volume 2, which can be found at the base of the tower where Yennefer resides while at Kaer Morhen. Search the room around the base of the stairwell to find it.
The mine mentioned in the note is the Iron Mine, southwest of Kaer Morhen. Enter the mine and head through the tunnel until you reach an open space, where you'll be attacked by an Earth Elemental. After defeating the elemental, look around the cavern for a pedestal. Place the tome on the pedestal and another tunnel will open. Just beside the pedestal you will also find Diagram: Superior Wolven gauntlets.
Head down the next tunnel and you will reach a room with the forge. Interact with the bellows, and a voice from the smoldering ashes will warn you to leave. Tell the voice that you want to look around, and an Fire Elemental will rise from the forge and attack you. The fight with the Ifrit can be tricky as its fire provides protection against melee attacks. Just being near the Ifrit will cause you to suffer fire damage. To counter this, hit the Ifrit with Aard to put out its flames. Once its flames are out, fighting is essentially the same as fighting an earth elemental.
Once you defeat the Ifrit, go back to the forge and use the Eye of Nehaleni to dispel the illusion to reveal a small room with three chests, completing the quest. (25)
One of the chests will contain Mastercrafted Wolven armor and Eternal Fire executioner's armor, while the other two have Mag Deira cuirass and Ban Ard breastplate respectively. Only the Wolven armor is of notable quality though.","Read the copy of the tome.
Go to the mine near Kaer Morhen.

Geralt makes several comments, including that the cave was formerly used for the Trial of the Grasses, before Kaer Morhen was built, but is now infested by monsters.
In addition to killing the nekker warriors and a devourer, one must inspect the various pieces of equipment and read the Trial of the Grasses registry tome, containing a list of old witcher candidates who underwent the Trial. Exploring the cave sufficiently and examining enough items ends the quest and rewards 25.","This quest has no journal objectives.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Devil_by_the_Well,White_Orchard,"The quest is simple enough and can be started by either finding the contract on the notice board or by talking to Odolan directly.
Speak to Odolan who'll explain the river's water has turned foul from all the bodies turning up in it from the war, and as a result, his daughter has fallen ill. The only way to cure her fever is to get fresh water from a well in the nearby abandoned village. However, a noonwraith haunts it, preventing him from getting near. You can barter a bit for a reward, and once agreed to, the marker will direct you to the well.
Investigate the Well[]
Head out and, if you arrive during the daytime, you'll see the Devil by the Well circling around the well. However, she won't attack unless you get too close, so you're free to investigate the huts unhindered. While they marker points to all 3 huts, the only one with evidence is the one on the east side. Enter it and read the diary written by a woman named Claer, then examine the skeleton. Geralt will then note he sees more blood. Follow it back to the hut's doorway for another area to examine.
If the noonwraith isn't out, you can safely examine the scorched area and body around the well, then the rope on the well. However, if she is out and you want to quickly finish the quest without waiting, approach and fight her. She'll soon flee and you can then investigate the well. You can then approach and examine the rope to find a woman's skeleton and Geralt will conclude the bracelet probably fell into the well, and which you need to get rid of the noonwraith for good.
With that, jump into to the well and use your Witcher Senses to find it at the bottom of the pool, then climb out of the water for Geralt to look the bracelet over. Afterwards, follow the path to another pool of water and dive underwater, following the underwater cavern out of the cave.
Dealing with the Noonwraith[]
Head back to the well, making sure to prepare for the fight, like crafting any oils and potions. Once ready, burn the skeleton and bracelet and she'll appear, regardless of the time of day. Make sure to use Yrden to keep her vulnerable to strikes and when she splits into 3 lesser noonwraiths, quickly take them out as she uses this time to try and heal. Once she's been dealt with loot her for the trophy (50) and head back to Odolan.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Jenny_o%27_the_Woods,Velen,"This quest can only be picked up by getting the notice, so get it off Midcopse's notice board, then go speak to the ealdorman about it. He'll eventually direct you to speak to Agneta who didn't see Jenny o' the Woods as she ran as soon as she appeared, but she does mention that she appeared after twilight.
With this in mind, head out to the fields and use your Witcher Senses to find a torn piece of fabric and someone's tracks. Follow them until you find a pool of blood and examine it to find the assassin's knife. Now follow the new trail until you reach the end: a shallow grave with a letter. With this, read the letter (earning 25 ) and head back to the ealdorman to ask about the names in the letter and he'll conclude the murdered woman, Zula, is the nightwraith. He'll then point you to the other end of the fields as one possible meeting spot that the young lovers went to.
Head back out to find a small campfire at the other end. If you want, take out the small bandit camp nearby before starting the fight with Jenny. To start, you need to interact with the fire here, but if it's not night time (9pm or later), you'll be given the option to meditate ahead to night. The nightwraith will then appear and the fight begins.
Note that she can be difficult to fight for the unprepared. Like most wraiths, you will need to use Yrden to be able to hit her. She'll also occasionally disappear and 3 regular nightwraiths appear. Take them out quickly (1 hit should suffice) as Jenny will refill her health during this time if they get close to you, so the longer you take, the more health she regains.
Once Jenny is defeated, loot the remains for the nightwraith trophy and Forgotten Vran Sword, then head back to the ealdorman for your reward and to complete the quest, earning 240  and 179 .","Talk to the ealdorman of Midcopse.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Missing_Brother,Velen,"This quest can be picked up at the Inn at the Crossroads' notice board, which will point you to talk to Bruno inside, or by finding the mine directly.
If you go to Bruno, he'll explain that his brother, Mikel, took it upon himself to take care of several women that were displaced when the war destroyed their village and had taken them to some old mines for shelter but hasn't returned. However, he's adamant Mikel can't possibly be dead despite everything indicating it's likely. You can haggle here if you wish, then head out to the location south of the Border Post.
Just outside the mine you'll find some bloody body parts and nearby monster tracks that lead into the mine. Head inside and down the ladder, then go left (going right will just go a long way around in a circle to the area that going left goes to immediately and will cause a young arachas to spawn in the area below the survivor).
You'll soon find the monster tracks again that lead to an area with a lot of blood you can examine. Note it's very easy to miss a fork here: just prior to all the blood, there's a path to the left (if you took the left route on entering the mine) that goes into an underwater tunnel. However, ignore that for now and instead go through the wooden archway area where you can examine other bodies, then head up the ladder to find a survivor. After talking to her, you can then head around to find a lever to use to drop the bridge, allowing her to escape, and where she'll make her way to the Border Post.
With that, head back to the underwater tunnel and follow the tracks to reach another cavern. This time though you find some eggs which, after being examined, Geralt will deduce it's a venomous arachas, Harrisi, earning 25 . It's important to destroy the eggs here with Igni or Aard, or it could lead to a more difficult fight later. With that, examine the fluids nearby and follow the scent trail to another underwater tunnel where you'll see more tracks you can follow to the next set of eggs, though this time a young arachas is waiting. Once the 4 eggs and the young arachas are dealt with, head back through the tunnel and continue into the next cavern.
Here, another young arachas is with the last 4 eggs. Dispatch all of them, then head into the final chamber where Geralt finds what's left of Mikel's body as Harrisi makes their appearance. Depending on your level, this can be a tough fight, so make sure to have insectoid oil, Tawny Owl, and Golden Oriole to counter Harrisi's venom. If you didn't deal with the eggs prior, Harrisi will let her children fight you first while she hangs back, but if they were already killed off, she'll fight you directly.
She uses 3 main abilities: throws a web out to pull Geralt within reach, shoots several toxic projectiles and, once the venom sac on her back is full, can release a large, toxic gas cloud. It's very helpful to use quen's shield here, while also hitting her with igni when you can. If close range isn't working, you can kite her using yrden traps with other related signs along with the crossbow. Once defeated, loot her for the arachas trophy. Before you leave though, make sure to look for a Nilfgaardian soldier's body in one of the alcoves as he'll have Gwyhyr on him as well. With that, head back to Bruno. Note that if you found the mine first, the quest marker won't update correctly and you'll need to go to the notice board to get the notice there to talk to Bruno (it won't direct you to do this in the quest).
Unlike his brother though, it appears Bruno isn't so generous, and refuses to pay you as he apparently wanted you to bring Mikel back alive. You now have 3 options:
tell him you risked your life (earns 200  and 84 )
use Axii (requires Delusion level 3, earns 40  for using it, and a reward of 200  and 210 )
say you won't beg (earns 300 )
Whatever you pick, you'll get the appropriate reward above and the quest will then complete.","Talk to Bruno.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Mysterious_Tracks,Velen,"The quest is available from Lindenvale's notice board or by finding the tracks or cave first. If picked up from the notice board, go speak to the hunter regarding it, who can be haggled with regarding the reward.
Head out to the area and examine the dead wolves, then pick up on the tracks nearby which will eventually lead to some fur on a tree to examine to pick up a scent trail. Continue following this new trail until you reach a sharp cliff where the entrance is too far up. Also note, there's a dung pile here to examine that Geralt will deduce belongs to a fiend. With that, go around and up the hill. If you didn't examine the dung pile below, there's another up here you can examine. To find the other entrance into the cave, look around the northern most tree up here and, just to the northwest, you'll find the hole. Carefully drop in (you may take some damage here).
Examine the fiend carcass, it's mouth to note the fur, then the two separate track prints and finally, the blood splatters. Once everything is examined Geralt will conclude it's a chort, the Howler, earning 25 . You need to lure it out however. The chort lure formula should then appear in the alchemy tab (though if you bought the formula from the merchant in Lindenvale, it would have already been there). Exit the cave and examine any of the three piles to acquire fiend dung if you haven't done that already. If you don't have any crow's eye, look on the hill and right around the base, where a few of the plants should be available. Once you have everything, craft the lure and equip it like a torch and use it at the 4 indicated spots. Then, once ready, go and re-enter the cave for a short cutscene where the Howler appears.
It is vulnerable to relict oil but the cave is small, making evasion difficult, so use quen to help against its charged attack, which can inflict bleeding. Once it's dead, loot it for the chort trophy, chort mutagen, and Azure Wrath. With that, return to the Lindenvale hunter who'll be glad to hear it's dead and will reward you with 400  and 193 , completing the quest.","Find the notice first:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Patrol_Gone_Missing,Velen,"Head to the Nilfgaardian Army Group 'Center' Camp in the furthest southeast part of Velen and either find Eggebracht's notice on the notice board here or speak directly with the quartermaster and ask for work to pick up this quest. He'll inform you that he sent some scouting troops out but they haven't returned so he needs you to find out what happened to them, then gives you a location west of the House of Respite.
At the location is a campsite, where you can examine the campfire and some tracks nearby that are of both armored and barefoot prints. Following them will lead to another set of Nilfgaardian prints that go on for a bit until Geralt comments on a stench. Following the stench to the right will lead to some wolves and green goo that can be examined that will point to a draconid but the path ends here. Following it to the left will go on a long winded trail with various versions of the same green goo, a couple bandits, and eventually ends near some nekkers, though by this point you can probably hear the wyvern with your Witcher Senses.
However, simply following the footprints is most straightforward and avoids most enemies. They eventually lead to a corpse, which you can examine. If Geralt already examined one of the green spots to determine a draconid was in the area, examining the body will confirm it and give the objective to kill the draconid. Continue following the footprints and you'll eventually come across the wyvern and another body. Once the wyvern is dead, loot it for a wyvern trophy. At this point you can return to the quartermaster but you can investigate further if you wish.
If you chose to follow the stench, backtrack a bit to just before you ran into the wyvern, otherwise continue a bit north from it. There are some mounds of dirt that you can examine to learn bodies were buried there before necrophages dug them up. Now examine the second body and the blood on the ground and follow this new trail to a cave where Geralt will comment on it being a ghoul's nest. Somewhat oddly though, there are no monsters inside. Head inside to find some more bodies, but this time on examining them Geralt will note they're not Nilfgaardian. With this in mind, you can now head back to talk to Eggebracht about what you've discovered.
If you didn't investigate further, or did and still accept payment, you'll get 10  and 50 . If you investigated and refused payment, you'll get 35  but no payment. Consequences: if you didn't investigate further and haven't done Blood Ties yet, Eggebracht will tell you the information by just asking. If you did investigate further, he'll refuse and you'll need to use Axii or bribe him instead.","Talk to the contract issuer.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Phantom_of_the_Trade_Route,Velen,"It can be picked up by either talking to a refugee in Benek, finding the ransacked caravan, or finding the cave where the refugees are hiding.
It's best to start with the refugee as you'll be able to haggle some if you wish. In short, some refugees, including his brother, were hired by a merchant group and were due back already. Agree to help, then head north along the road to find the ransacked caravan.
There's a number of clues here to examine including the blood splatter, the barrel, nearby tracks, and the claw marks in the rock. Once everything is examined Geralt will pick up on the wine scent that'll take you a ways northeast until you reach a large cave entrance with a body right there. Examine it, then head inside and, just below the ledge to the left, you'll find the other 2 missing men. If you talked to the other refugee first, you can ask about the brother, who's the one who died at the entrance. No matter how you found them, you can ask what happened exactly to learn the merchants use them as bait to keep their actual people and goods safe.
If you found them first before talking to the one in Benek, you can then tell them the way is clear but regardless they're not so sure and refuse to leave until the monster is taken care of. If you talked to the Benek refugee, Geralt will automatically decide to go kill it. Once the conversation is done you'll earn 30  from talking to them, and 25  for learning it's a royal wyvern.
With that, head south, going up the ramp. Mind the gap at the first ledge, then continue to climb up. Note: If you have the Hearts of Stone expansion, you'll see a path that goes down around here, but that's not the path you need for this quest. Once you reach the top you'll find 2 wyverns and 2 monster nests. Kill them both, then destroy the nests (20  each) and prepare for a short cutscene as the royal wyvern makes its appearance.
Keep in mind while you have a lot of space up here to move, there is a ledge and you can fall to your death. Once it's also dead, loot it for the wyvern trophy and Anathema sword, and the 2 refugees you found in the cave will come out to see for themselves before leaving. Note that if you don't loot it quick enough the refugees will talk to you first, but you can just loot it afterwards.
Head back to Benek to let the refugee know. If you didn't talk to him beforehand, he'll be reluctant at first to reward you as the friends haven't arrived back, but nevertheless gives you it. If you did talk to him beforehand though, the men arrived and he'll give you your reward readily. Regardless, you'll earn 250  and 192 , completing the quest.","Talk to the refugee in Benek first:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Shrieker,Velen,"You can start this quest either by finding the notice on Crow's Perch's notice board, or by finding the shrieker's cave.
If you found the notice, you'll be directed to talk to Chet, who's near the entrance into the village. Talk to him to learn Borzoy, the old lord's hunter, tried to take out an unknown beast in the area but was killed by it instead. He'll then point out that the hunter's son, Symko, is the only one that may know something about the beast, but understandably, is in shock over losing his last parent. Chet took in the orphan, so head around the hut to find him with the goats. He reveals a bit about the monster before he starts to get upset. You can use Axii here for an additional 25  if you wish, as either choice will end the conversation.
Now head out to the field east of Crow's Perch where you'll find a dead dog and some tracks near it. Follow them a short distance to find some monster blood. Follow this new trail as it goes near the water then across and up the small hill and around the Burned Ruins nearby until you find one final piece of evidence: tracks that lead into a nearby cave. From this, Geralt learns it's a cockatrice (earning 25 ).
Head into the cave and once near the last chamber, you'll hear the shrieker in an inaccessible part of the cave. Use your Witcher Senses to hone in on its hiding spot, which it's not about to leave, so lob either a samum, grapeshot, or dancing star bomb up there to get it to come out of hiding. Problem is, it left through a back way, so run out of the cave, going right to chase after it. Don't worry, you don't need Roach here, just run after it and soon enough it'll turn back to fight you. Note: This is one quest where it doesn't matter much distance there is between Geralt and the target; you can return later to kill it off without the quest failing.
After it's been slain, claim the Cockatrice trophy and cockatrice stomach along with other loot, then head back to Chet to turn it in. You'll have the option to tell him to keep the coin for Symko or take it. If you take the coin (or killed the shrieker before finding the notice) you'll earn 235  and 176 , otherwise if you refuse the reward you'll earn just 250 . The quest will then complete, but if you picked up the notice to start the quest, you can go tell Symko that his father has been avenged, to which he'll thank the witcher before running off.","Start quest from notice:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Swamp_Thing,Velen,"This quest can be picked up either by talking to the peat digger, finding the mysterious fog, or by finding the notice on Downwarren's notice board. Note: The contract will appear on the notice board only after obtaining the The Eye of Nehaleni.
Approach Leslav and talk to him to learn about the monster. You can then choose to haggle or not over your pay and, once agreed, head out to where the marker is. If you found the fog first, the marker will simply point you to this area, no interaction with Leslav needed. Regardless, a search area with then pop up to the east.
Note: Like with most contracts it is possible to haggle up to 300 , thus if you wait you will earn 600  making this contract one of the most well paying in the game.
Several drowners may appear on your way to the search area, though they aren't part of the quest. Once they're no longer a threat, you'll see a body near some rocks, and Geralt will comment on there being an illusion there. Examine the body, then use the Eye of Nehaleni on the ""rocks"" to reveal the missing tracks. You can follow them, but they're spread out a bit and they lead to where the marker is pointing anyways: a small hut to the west. You could also just skip finding the body entirely and go to the hut in the next part to continue the quest.
If you found the body and tracks, you just need to examine one of the things (the body or the blood smear) at the hut to learn of the unique foglet, Ignis Fatuus and earning 25 . If you skipped over the previous step, then you need to examine both. Once you've looted the area, head towards the new search area. Around the southeast part of the yellow area on your map Geralt will comment that he needs to use Nehaleni's Eye. There are two entrances you can use this on, but this assumes you used the eastern entrance. The western entrance has a horse's corpse nearby and the other is the cave entrance marker nearby. If you don't have the eye, you'll need to go to this cave marker to get inside.
Using your Witcher Senses, you should see what appears to be a large boulder in this area with the icon above it that indicates it's in illusion. Interact with it to reveal a cave and head inside. A foglet will soon appear in this first area, so take him out. Necrophage oil works against it and after you killed it, look in an alcove on the left to find a few lootable containers, one of which contains the Ursine superior silver sword diagram. Now, head deeper into the cave system to find the special foglet, Ignis Fatuus. Note: if you used the western entrance, when you venture in far enough it'll automatically go to the cutscene to fight Ignis Fatuus, skipping the first foglet fight. If you used the one unhidden entrance though, you'll still have to deal with a foglet before getting to Ignis Fatuus.
His hits do a lot of damage, so play it safe by dodging and using Quen. The monster cannot leave the fog, so run off to regenerate health with a Swallow potion if you need to. Like other foglets, he disappears into the fog a lot and will also summon minor foglets to distract you, though they have no power level and can be one hit easily. You can also use Yrden here, which will make any that spawn in the circles instantly disappear.
Once he's dead, loot the corpse for the foglet trophy and Carabella, then head to the original contract giver, even if you didn't talk to him first. If you found the fog and didn't talk to him first, or didn't haggle, he'll automatically give you 136  and the quest will complete, netting you 240 .
If you did talk to him prior and haggled, he'll explain he doesn't have all the gold that you haggled for and you can either demand he pay up all he has now or wait a week for him to pay you double. If you demand he pay now, he'll give you all he has, but it's only a portion of what was agreed on. If you agree to wait a week for double the amount, return in 7 days time and, true to his promise, he'll pay you double the original pay.

Regardless, the quest will take you to the village in far southwestern Velen and where it's currently overrun by ghouls. Once you kill the ghouls off, a short time later 2 survivors will come out, but are obviously hiding something. You can choose to continue poking holes in their story or to back off and leave. If you back off and go back to Milan, he'll thank you for your report and reward you with 300  and 195 (or 146  if he wasn't talked to prior).
Note: If you want extra payment from Bytomir later, choose the ""I'm nosy"" option, or he will know that someone else hired you.
However, if you choose to be nosy (or say you're being paid if Milan was talked to prior) you can examine the pig and dog carcasses but what you really need to examine are the 2 soldiers' bodies. When you do so, Geralt will pick up on a scent. Follow it up the hill to the hut and Bytomir will approach, still trying to deny anything suspicious before eventually caving, revealing the villagers found elven ruins beneath their village. They were plundering it for treasure to make some money, but awoke a terrible beast within and proceeded to try and bury the entrance. Unfortunately for the Nilfgaardians, they tried to re-enter the tunnels only to be killed by the creature before it ran back to its lair. Bytomir will then give you the key to the hut so you can investigate.
Enter the hut and you'll find some fur just inside that, when examined, Geralt will conclude it's an ekimmara, Sarasti, earning 25 .

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Woodland_Beast,Velen,"This quest can be picked up by reading the notice on the Border Post's notice board or Oxenfurt's, then talking to the captain nearby at the Border Post (he won't be named so use your marker to find him) who'll point out something is attacking and killing Redanian caravans along the main roads. While he can't haggle the reward, he does offer to give you a letter of safe conduct, if you haven't already gotten one from the Bloody Baron or the fake (but still effective) one from the Shady merchant nearby.
Ride out to where the marker is, at the crossroads just before the river north-northeast of Inn at the Crossroads, to find a couple alghouls around some wagons. Once you killed them off, examine the area, in particular the looted chests and the body against the fancy cart. Examining the other bodies just makes a note that necrophages were feeding on the carcasses. Using your Witcher Senses, find the footprints and follow them, where they lead towards the river and a group of drowners. Kill them off, then look for the tracks that continue up the hill on the other side.
As you near the tree, it'll cut to a Scoia'tael member in the trees, demanding why you're there. If you answer in any way other than asking to see the commander, the elves will attack. They'll also attack if you ask to see the commander but then refuse to surrender your weapon.
See the commander[]
If you give your weapons over, you'll then meet the commander, Vernossiel, who will explain it's not civilians but Redanian soldiers they're killing, as the soldiers also killed and tortured the Scoia'tael, and they need the supplies. You can choose to let them continue or kill them.
If you decide to kill them from the dialogue, you won't have any weapons on you. You can, however, grab the sword that was near Vernossiel and use your signs. After all the Scoia'tael are dead, retrieve your stuff from the nearby container and loot the commander's body for a squirrel tail.
If you side with the elves, you're given back your weapons along with a few miscellaneous items.
You can also choose to initially side with the elves, then after you're free to move again, attack, but this time you'll have all your weapons, just remember to re-equip as it won't default to what you were initially using prior to your weapons being taken. Note that if you do this route, you don't need to gather any of the squirrel tails as Geralt will appear to hand one over to the guard anyways.
Turn in contract[]
Return to the captain where you have two choices if you let them be: tell him about the Scoia'tael or say there wasn't any monster. If the latter, he'll get mad and you'll only gain 25  and nothing else. If you tell him about the Scoia'tael, he'll just give you the pass and 25 , as you didn't fully complete the job. Note: if you go this route, the Scoia'tael leader can show up later, stating you betrayed her and will then attack you.
If you killed off the Scoia'tael though, he'll give you the pass, 25 , and 30 .","Talk to the commander of the guardpost by the bridge to Novigrad.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_An_Elusive_Thief,Novigrad,"The quest starts by picking up Contract: Imp from Hierarch Square's notice board and then speaking to Sylvester Amello. He'll tell you what he knows about the imp before letting you get to work.
Using Witcher Senses near his stall you'll see he was telling the truth: there's tracks like that of a large cat. Follow them up to the point you reach a wall where you can examine some of the food the imp dropped. The tracks now have also changed to that of scratches.
Follow this new set until you get to the bridge and Geralt will comment that the imp must have dove into the moat. As you might have guessed, jump over and swim towards shore to see the tracks pick up again, but examine them to see they've changed to that of footprints. They lead just a short distance away to the house with the wide open door, so stroll in and pick up the short letter on the table and read it to learn the imp is a doppler, earning 25 . As dopplers can take any form, you'll need a way to track him down.
Head upstairs and examine the clothes to pick up a strong scent of lavender and follow this trail outside where you'll eventually see an Eternal Flame guard talking with an elf in a rather unusual friendly tone. Interact with them and they'll pretend the guard was actually harassing the elf before the elf goes off. Choose whichever dialogue option you want and the doppler will morph before running off. Important: make sure you follow closely. If he gets too far away, the quest will fail.
Once you get close enough to him, hit the interact button to grab him and after a short exchange of words, he'll fight you as a replica of Geralt, complete with abilities. Knock his health down to 1/4 and he'll surrender and ask for mercy. You can then choose to let him go or kill him.
Note: If you try to run away after starting the fight he will indefinitely pursue Geralt everywhere. Even if you manage to fast travel very far away he will run all the way to continue the fight. He will not follow Geralt if you go to another map like Skellige, however, he will continue the chase as soon as you return to the Velen/Novigrad map. So the only way to get rid of him at this point is in fact to defeat him.
If you have completed the main quest Count Reuven's Treasure but not finished the subsequent main quest The Play's the Thing, a third dialogue option will present itself after catching and defeating the doppler. Geralt will ask him to impersonate Caleb Menge and sail to Temple Isle to trigger Dandelion's release. Horrified, the doppler pleads instead to be killed by Geralt than be subjected to torture. Geralt relents and lets him go. This option yields no additional rewards as the doppler runs off without giving a bonus of crowns or a weapon diagram, and the merchant will only pay half the reward as Geralt cannot produce a trophy.
If you let him go, you'll only get half the reward from the merchant but the doppler gives you 25 , 215 , and the Diagram: Gnomish Gwyhyr for letting him go. More importantly though, letting him go means you won't get a doppler mutagen or the trophy. If you choose to kill him, he won't take on the witcher form again and will fight like a regular bandit, making him a lot easier to kill, but without any extra rewards outside of the loot.
Whichever decision you chose, go back and talk to Sylvester. If you killed the doppler, he'll be pleased and give you the full reward (245  and 182 ). However, if you let the doppler go, he doesn't appreciate Geralt's remark about having no head to show as proof and will only give half the amount (245  and 91 ). The quest will then complete.","Go to the marketplace during the day and talk to Sylvester Amello.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Deadly_Delights,Novigrad,"This quest can only be started by finding the notice on Harborside's notice board. From there, find Gilbert standing guard at the bridge around the Fish Market and he'll tell you a bit about the bodies and that they're at the docks, set to be burned soon. With that, head to the marker to find the medic and talk with him, exhausting all options to learn more about the killings, which will then point you to a location behind Crippled Kate's.
Here you'll find 3 tracks: unimportant guard's and children footprints, but also two-legged hoofprints. Follow the hoofprints around until they point you to the backdoor of Crippled Kate's. While the quest will update to talk to the madame, you may notice in the alley corner just past the door something else with your Witcher Senses. On examining it, you'll pick up a perfume trail. This is where you have two options to find the killer.
Note: If you wish to do all the tasks, you can either go ahead and talk to the Madame without using Axii, or first follow the scent until you find a man, but don't talk to him yet.
If you talk to the Madame and choose anything but the Axii option (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35), she won't tell you and you'll have to resort to finding the perfume bottle. If you do use Axii though, she'll tell you that you're dealing with a succubus but she doesn't know if it kills before giving you the key to its house nearby. The quest will then point you directly to the house in question and you can enter through the front door to confront Salma.
If you followed the scent instead, it will lead you to an ill-feeling man at the bottom of some stairs. Talk with him to confirm that not only is this the right place, but it's a succubus you're looking for. (25) The house door up the stairs is locked though, so walk around into the next house just south (along the eastern side of the buildings) and go all the way up the stairs. Then up the ladder, across the platforms, and finally up one last ladder to enter the building's attic. Drop in then head all the way downstairs to confront Salma.
Regardless of how you got in, you can choose to immediately attack the succubus or hear her out. If you listen to her, she'll give you a basic explanation that she was caught by surprise and attacked by the guards, so she defended herself. You can then choose to kill her or tell her she has to leave the city.
If she has to leave the city, she'll give you the Succubus trophy to show as proof and Maugrim, even though she's not happy about it. The door will then automatically unlock for you if you didn't acquire the key from Madame. If you instead choose to kill her, you can loot the body for the trophy, the rare Succubus mutagen and Assassin's gauntlets, but no sword. If you don't already have the key, you'll have to get it off her body to unlock the door, although it's possible to go back the way you came.
Important: If you decide to kill Salma, note that prior to Patch 4.0 she was vulnerable to steel swords and not silver.
With proof in hand, head back to Gilbert and he'll be pleased, giving you 270  and 186  (or the haggled amount) and the quest completes.","Talk to the guard.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Doors_Slamming_Shut,Novigrad,"This quest can only be started from the contract notice found either on Hierarch Square's notice board or Gildorf's notice board (the count won't talk to you if you approach him before getting the notice).
Once you have it, head to the second floor in the Kingfisher to find him and he'll ask which school you're from first, though this won't matter much as he'll just make a slightly different comment on whichever option you choose. He'll eventually reveal he doesn't believe the house is haunted, but obviously something is making the house tremble and quake. Once you accept it he'll give you the key to the house to investigate.
With the key in hand, head out to Moldavie Residence and unlock the door and start looking inside where, in the second room with the food, the house will tremble. You can examine the food there before continuing into the next room where a bed is. While not needed, the chest at the foot of the bed has Journal from the Moldavie Residence, which gives some insight into the residence's history.
At the top of the stairs you'll find scattered salt you can examine, though again it doesn't help to figure out what's going on. Continue downstairs and Geralt will note feeling air coming through a crack in the wall, so blast it open with Aard and head through to discover some ancient elven ruins were right below the house. On the far side of the room, examine the table for Amaverick of Sorano's journal and read it, then examine the large root object on the other table. With both of these, Geralt will conclude it's a power earth elemental, Therazane, before gaining 25 .
You'll need to raise the blocked doorway, so now jump into the water and swim down the hallway to the switch here and use it to raise the door, then swim back and go around the other side to get back up. As soon as you approach the door, you'll see the elemental is bound behind a Force Field, which it has almost broken through. You can safely look around the room while the bubble is up, in particular note there's 2 wooden supports in this room.
Important: avoid hitting these unless you wish for Kurt to die after the quest is done. Also remember that, when the fighting starts, Therazane can also destroy them, most notably if it uses the earth ring attack. Thus winning the fight without destroying the supports can be a very difficult task if you wish for Kurt to live. Only one of the supports needs to be preserved though, but you should kill the elemental as quickly as possible. Northern Wind and Dimeritium bombs are very helpful, as the former will freeze it while the latter will prevent it from using it's magical attacks like the earth ring, however, it will not stop it from throwing punches which may also destroy the supports.
Once you're ready, head to the device behind the bubble and use Aard on it, then hurry into position as, after a small delay, the device will finally fail and Therazane will try to kill you. Note that if you need to recover (like low health) you can back out of the room to get a small reprieve, as the earth elemental can't follow you into the other room. Once you've killed it, loot it for the earth elemental trophy and the cleaver hood sword, then head back to Kurt.
He'll be glad to know the problem is taken care of and will reward you with 200  and 300 , completing the quest. However, if you destroyed both supports, when you visit the residence after some time has passed, a servant will be standing at the southern wall (near the pond) and inform you Kurt died when the ceiling in the ruins collapsed on him.","Talk to Kurt Dysart.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Lord_of_the_Wood,Novigrad,"To start this quest, pick up the contract notice off of either the Cunny of the Goose's notice board or Farcorners', then head into Cunny of the Goose's inn and talk with Brean near the innkeep. He'll tell you how he started up a lumberjack camp only for something to attack his men, with only one surviving the ordeal. Note: You can also pick this quest up by finding the wagon mentioned further down, but if you do so, you won't be able to haggle for a reward.
After agreeing to take it, you can talk to the nearby witness, who's sitting on the opposite side of the inn. After a few curt words, once you reveal you're tracking down the monster, he'll only be able to reveal he heard a horrible wolf's howling and was told to grab some weapons, but on returning he found only a massacre.
With that, head out to the Loggers' Hut where you'll only find one clue to examine: the wagon's tracks. Follow them on foot or on Roach along the road until you find the wagon. There are nekkers very close in the woods near the road, so you may have to deal with some of them. When you reach the place, there's a number of things to examine, including the sword/blood, the blood splatters, the dwarf tracks, and the claw marks on the nearby stone. Follow the blood tracks a short distance to find one of the dead dwarves to examine, then go back and follow the footprints to find the other body and examine it. Once everything has been examined Geralt will deduce it's a young leshen, Kernun, earning 25 . You'll then need to find its totem to draw it out.
The correct location is the one farthest east, in the middle of the woods. Prepare yourself, then destroy the totem for a cutscene where it'll start to rain and Kernun will appear, clearly not pleased. He'll fight like any normal leshen, like summoning wolves, disappearing in a flock of crows, and using roots to try and ensnare you. However, even with the rain Igni is still very effective against him. Once dead, loot the body for a trophy and the Black Unicorn, then head back to Brean. He'll be thrilled, giving you 250  and 195 , completing the quest.","Start quest by talking to Brean:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_The_Apiarian_Phantom,Novigrad,"This quest can be started several different ways:
find the notice on Yantra's notice board
find Holofernes at Honeyfill Meadworks
find the beast's tracks (sometimes doesn't work)
If you do one of the first two options, talk to the halfling at his home and after a short conversation he'll mention they're being plagued by something called the apiarian phantom. Nobody has seen the beast, but one of the farmhands was killed by what appeared to be frostbite and even had frost in his hair. Two of the sons will then lead you out to the site of the attack on one of the hives, explaining that the apiarian phantom is said to attack and kill off hives if the owner doesn't treat the bees with respect.
At the site you'll find one of the hives is indeed covered in frost. Examine it and the blood pile, then the nearby tracks that you can follow to a small pond. While they initially disappear here, head towards the southeast part of the pond to pick the trail back up. There are quite a few drowners and drowned dead on the way. Deal with the monsters or just run around them, following the tracks a short distance until they disappear down a small tunnel at a construction site.
Geralt can't fit through it, so head around the ruins to a locked cellar. A small cutscene starts where one of the sons appears, explaining it was a house his father had been building but ran out of coin, before giving you the cellar key to unlock it, earning 25 . The cutscene will play out similarly if you had found the hive and tracks on your own as well.
With this, unlock one of the doors (it may glitch for a moment making it hard to open after) and as you enter you see the Apiaran Phantom is a lone hound of the wild hunt. The monster will run off and you'll have to chase it around the Gustfields area until it stops near the Dancing Windmill where you can finally fight - it is scripted to do so and Geralt will automatically whistle for Roach, so mount up and chase it. It's ok if you lose sight of it in this chase: unlike other quests, no matter how much distance there is you'll still be able to find and kill it, rather than the quest failing.
Note: It is possible to avoid the annoying chase by stunning the hound with Axii before it triggers its run. When the door opens, take only one to two small steps so it is on focus and its light-blue label appears - that's when you can target it. Unless stopped in its place before the label turns white, there's no longer a way to attack it until the chase completes.
Once it's dead, loot it for the Wild Hunt hound trophy and head back for your reward. Holofernes will be grateful, and after explaining how they saw the Wild Hunt a few weeks past, will reward you with 250  and 249 , completing the quest.","Ask Holofernes Meiersdorf about the contract on the Apiarian Phantom.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_The_Creature_from_Oxenfurt_Forest,Novigrad,"You can start this quest a few ways:
Pick up this contract off Oxenfurt's notice board
Find Hans at his camp and talk to him
Find the archgriffin's nest while exploring
If you found the notice, head out to the impromptu camp east-southeast of the Herbalist's Hut to find Hans. He'll tell you how he and his group of men decided to try and take out a beast in the area to help the locals but it was clear they were outmatched as 2 of his men just disappeared, never to be seen again, thus his notice. You can haggle with him if you wish, then he'll give a location further east-southeast.
Head out here to find a corpse and a lot of blood, but notably not a second body. After examining these 2 pieces of evidence, go further north to find a human arm, and nearby more blood, though this time you have a better trail to follow the flying monster. While you follow this trail, you'll likely come across a pack of wolves, so kill them off, then continue following the trail to where some ravens are gathered around the last bit of the body, picked clean. While this trail has disappeared, you can follow the birds in the sky to the east, as they'll lead you to the rest of the body. If it's after 7pm, you'll likely hear the monster soon, otherwise during the day you'll need to investigate some more.
As you near some rocky cliffs here, if it's nighttime the archgriffin, Opinicus, will be here and you'll go straight into fighting it. Otherwise, you'll find some large feathers nearby or at the nest which, on examining them, Geralt will deduce it's an archgriffin. Regardless how you learn about it, you'll earn 25  here.
If it's during the day, climb up the ledge to find the nest and what's left of the second body. However, there is an interesting letter on the body here that you should read and Geralt will make a comment on, then meditate or come back after 7pm and Opinicus will be there. If you found it after nighttime, you can still find the letter after killing Opinicus to use later. After you kill the archgriffin, loot the body for a griffin trophy (it is labeled as such), archgriffin mutagen, and the Zireael armor, then head back to Hans or, if you found the griffin by accident, get the notice off Oxenfurt's notice board to turn it in.
Talk to him to let him know it's dead, but if you found the letter, you now have a choice to mention it and demand a better reward. Doing this will earn 300  and 331  (or 170  on top of what you haggled originally). If you didn't read the letter though, or didn't mention it, you'll still get 300  but only 221 . Whatever you decide, the quest will then conclude here. Consequences: with the Hearts of Stone expansion, if one wants to get Quinto, you'll have to deal with Hans again who will be mad and demand you pay double to release him if you had demanded he pay you more during this contract.","Start quest by finding the notice:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_The_Oxenfurt_Drunk,Novigrad,"To start the quest, pick up the contract from Oxenfurt's notice board and read it, which will then point you to a guardsman, Nikolas Friedman, standing around the docks to the west. He keeps things to the point and once you've exhausted all parts of the conversation, will point you to two people: a medic and a witness.
It doesn't matter who you talk to first, but you will need to talk to both and examine the other areas they give.
The witness is busy trying to get drunk and you'll need to either pay 30  (gives 3 ) for her drink or use Axii (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35 ). However, she doesn't have much to say other than she'd been drinking and has a gut feeling it wasn't human, whatever attacked her. While mostly unhelpful, she is able to give you another area to look for clues: the nearby alley. Going here, you'll find an object just inside the archway.
The medic is in the southwest part of Oxenfurt, and apparently doesn't think much of the victims, having been vagrants stinking of alcohol, but thankfully hasn't burned the bodies yet. He'll eventually give you the key so you can check the bodies out yourself. You just need to examine the two inside to learn it's a vampire.
Once both are talked to and the alley and bodies examined, Geralt will conclude it's a katakan, Gael, who has a penchant for blood mixed with alcohol, earning 25 .
With this, head to The Alchemy and talk to Stjepan. Select ""need a drink"" and pay him 50 , earning 5 .
Note: If you have enough toxicity from decoctions or potions to go over your overdose threshold before paying to get drunk in the tavern, the quest will automatically fail immediately after being brought outside. This can be avoided by using Heightened Tolerance to increase the threshold, or by using White Honey or meditating to clear Toxicity prior to speaking with Stjepan.
Note: Even if you have more than enough alcohol in your inventory, there's no way to use it to get yourself drunk; you'll have to pay the innkeep to do so.
Time will skip to night with a now drunk Geralt who'll start singing rather amusing verses. Note: you won't be able to move any faster during this part of the quest nor save and this part is proximity sensitive: if you wander too far from the objective area, then the quest will fail. While the initial area is to walk around, it'll require you to walk south along the road just west of the inn, so head in that direction as Geralt sings and townspeople comment on this. Eventually your path will take you back up north and this time Gael has noticed you before coming out to fight. However, after getting his health down a fourth, he'll run off.
Continue northwards where, with your Witcher Senses, you can pinpoint him as he moves, eventually hiding in the hut to the north of Oxenfurt. Head around to find a ladder up to the attic to get in, then drop down to finish him off. Once he's dead, loot his body for a number of items, notably the katakan trophy, Deargdeith sword, a key (to get out), and the katakan mutagen.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_The_White_Lady,Novigrad,"This quest can be started a few different ways:
picking up the contract off Farcorners' notice board
climbing to the top of Drahim Castle and examining the floor
finding the dead bodies around the campfire and examining them
Note that no matter how you start it, you'll essentially do the same objectives, just in a different order.
The most straightforward way is finding the notice, which will have you talk to Helma nearby. She'll tell you about 4 men who got drunk and thought giving the White Lady a ""plowing"" would get the monster to stop, but obviously didn't work. Helma will then point you to an area near Drahim Castle to begin your search.
Head out here to find 3 bodies around a campfire. While you can examine the bottles they're not needed to advance the quest: just examine all 3 bodies and, if you talked to Helma beforehand, Geralt will note he expected 4 bodies here. This will cause tracks to appear nearby that you can examine, then follow up to the castle. If you instead found the bodies before talking to Helma, the tracks still appear, just no comment by Geralt.
At the end of the footprints trail you'll find a blood splatter you can examine and follow down into the cellar to find the fourth body. Bug: a ghoul is supposed to appear here but sometimes only appears if you examined the tower first, or after you already examined the fourth body and started to leave the area.
If you examined the other bodies before this, Geralt will conclude it's a noonwraith, earning 25 . If you instead examined the castle first, you must follow the tracks to the campfire and examine the rest to then reach the same conclusion.
How ever you learn it's a noonwraith, you'll be directed to talk to Helma who, on learning this, reveals it must be Luzi, a woman who committed suicide on her wedding day rather than be married off to a much older man her parents betrothed her to. Helma will then bring out the dagger that Luzi had killed herself with and will give it to you to use to lure the noonwraith out. Head back to the campfire and, when ready, interact with the fire for a small cutscene where The White Lady appears.
Like any noonwraith, she's vulnerable to Yrden, and occasionally will split into 3 weaker forms that she uses to try and heal, so kill them off quickly if this happens. Once she's dead, loot her for the noonwraith trophy and Deithwen, then head back to Helma for your reward, who'll be thankful and give you 260  and 184 .","If quest is started through the notice:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Dragon,Skellige,"This quest can be picked up two ways:
from the contract on Fyresdal's notice board
by finding and speaking to Fyresdal's elder, Vagn
Unless you know where Vagn is, it's far easier to start with the notice as he doesn't show an exclamation point. Track him to the middle of town where he's a pretty simple man: he believes there's a dragon in the area and needs you to kill it and scoffs at trying to describe it. You can haggle or not with him, then he'll point you to two local boys that were recently killed, but have yet to be buried so you can examine them for information.
Head over to the house in question to find the grieving mother, Karli, standing near the two bodies. Talk to her and she'll be annoyed at first, as apparently many others have just barged in to gape at the bodies, but once you explain to her why you're there, she'll let you examine them. You just need to look at one to note while there are claw and bite marks, there's no burns.
Now head out to the search area to examine the cow's body, then the blood on the nearby rocks and follow the trail until you find the dog's body. Geralt will deduce it's actually a forktail but you need bait to lure it out, gaining 25 . Go talk to the elder and he'll give you bait in the form of Mia, a sheep. Herd her to the forktail's nest (if having difficulties, you can use Axii, though this could lead to issues with keeping the sheep alive if you're aiming for that). Once close enough, the forktail appears.
After it's dead, loot it for the Forktail trophy and Dancer, then head back to Vagn to let him know it's dead. If you mock him, he won't catch on and will give you the full reward (204  or whatever you haggled). However, if you correct him and say it was a forktail, he'll only pay half the amount (102  by default) claiming he could have killed the ""forkytail"" himself if that was the case. Either way you'll gain the full 350 , completing the quest.","Talk to the village elder of Fyesdal.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Here_Comes_the_Groom,Skellige,"This quest can be picked up two ways, either by picking up the notice off Svorlag's notice board, or finding the cave on your own.
If you pick up the notice, go talk to Kevan, who'll inform you his sister's betrothed, Nils, likely ran off, but Britt keeps insisting a monster carried him off instead. Kevan doesn't believe it as the couple weren't exactly a great match, but nonetheless would like some closure for his sister. He'll then point you to a location across the bay, where Britt is.
Go to the spot and she'll be upset, but explains just enough that some flying monster grabbed Nils and flew off to the caves on the southern part of the island, to the south of Old Watchtower. Head out there where, just as you enter the cave, a drowner will attack. After killing it, you should see some odd tracks in the water and, on examining it, Geralt will note they're that of a large siren. Make your way further into the cave, where you'll have to kill off more drowners, before reaching a large chamber.
After the immediate threats are killed, examine the strange statue here to learn it's an altar to Melusine then, near the eastern tunnel, you'll find some scales in the water to examine, and will lead to the conclusion it's a powerful ekhidna that must have come out of hibernation, earning 25 . Head down this tunnel to find yet more drowners around some explosive barrels. Once they're dealt with, proceed to climb up the ledge to the opening here and examine the dead body (Nils) for a cutscene before Melusine makes her entrance.
Deal with her like any other flying creature, except crossbow shots only deal damage and don't bring her down. Using Aard to knock her out of the air is most effective. Also note to stay away from the ledges: you can fall, possibly killing yourself during the fight. After she's defeated, loot the corpse for Ekhidna trophy, then head back to Kevan where you'll earn 250  and 186  (by default if you didn't haggle or found the cave first). If you started the quest at the cave you'll need to get the notice off the notice board before getting the reward. The quest will then conclude here if you started at the cave.
However, if you started the quest from the notice, Kevan will then ask if you can tell his sister the news, which you can tell him he should instead or agree and tell her. If you decline, the quest will complete here, but if you agree, go back to the cliffs to tell Britt and she'll offer a reward. If you decline you'll earn 20 , but if you accept it you'll get 20  and 25 , either way completing the quest.","If quest is started from the notice:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Missing_Miners,Skellige,"You can start this quest from the notice board in Blandare or by finding one of the dead bodies on the road west of Miners' Camp (on the way to the cave).
If you start with the notice, talk to Gjarr, who'll say they sent some men to see if they could mine any silver up north. With that, head to Miners' Camp and examine the silver in the box and the footprints, then follow them to a body (this is also where you can pickup the quest without doing the notice).
After examining the body here, you'll see some tracks you can follow, which will also take you by some toppled trees, before reaching the cave entrance where some human remains can be examined, and Geralt will conclude it's a rock troll, earning 25 . Before heading all the way in to see Wham-a-Wham, go down the cave path to the left to examine a couple more bodies and a silver vein on the wall. As you approach the troll he'll be pissed and attack you, but once his health is down enough or if you run away without attacking him, he'll finally talk, revealing that the people came into his home and despite him asking them to leave, hammered away at the silver veins in the cave, so he killed them. You can now choose to kill him or let this slide.
If you let it slide, he'll agree not to do it again, giving you 25 , 50 , and some silver ore. If you choose to kill him instead, you'll get Cave troll trophy and Caroline, along with a troll mutagen. Whatever you chose, go inform Gjarr on the outcome. If you spared the troll he'll reveal they heard mentions of one but chose to ignore this and get the silver anyways and, annoyed that you let it live, will only give 100  and 50 . If you killed Wham-a-Wham instead, he'll be pleased and gives 200  and 203 .

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Missing_Son,Skellige,"This quest can be started 3 different ways, though if you find the body first you won't be able to learn all the details:
find the notice on Rannvaig's notice board
talk to Odhen directly
find the fiend while exploring
If you talk to Odhen, he'll tell you his son, Olve, ran off with some from Faroe to seek out adventure in the fortress ruins just north of Boxholm, and you'll be able to distinguish him by a yellow tunic.
With that, head south to the ruins to find a body and some tracks just outside a break in the walls. While the tracks aren't commented on, you can examine the body and then head into the ruins, but be careful as a powerful fiend, Morvudd, is waiting just behind the wall. As you fight it, it'll periodically try to use it's third eye and, as you get it close to its death, it will use it one last time to flee from the fight. (15)
Note: That last use of the third eye can't be interrupted, as Morvudd is scripted to blind you and flee. If you manage to cut down the monster fast enough, it will still run away and not die during this encounter.
Afterwards, you can examine the body it'd been eating on, then note the tracks in the southern corner. Follow them down, across the bridge, and eventually through Boxholm, where you can examine some trees before finding Morvudd hiding out in another ruin. This time he won't be able to run away, but will quite likely be back to full health. Finish him off and loot it for the Fiend trophy and Longclaw (25). Note that if you found the fiend first you don't need to examine the body here, as Geralt will appear to know automatically Olve is dead. However, you can still go examine the body near where the fiend was standing to learn Olve's fate.
You can then head back to Rannivaig, but before you do, you can actually find the treasure Olve was looking for, in a cave under the ruins where you first encountered Morvudd. A chest there will contain 300 orens and Geralt will have a comment for it.
When you return to Odhen, he will naturally be upset at learning his son is dead, but will reward you all the same with 300  and 204  (by default if you talked to him first, otherwise 273  if you found the fiend first), and the quest will complete.","If quest is started through the notice or Odhen:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Muire_D%27yaeblen,Skellige,"This quest can be picked up a few different ways:
from Kaer Trolde Harbor's notice board
speaking to Bjorg directly
finding the cave and dealing with Abaya
Talk to Bjorg and he'll tell you they have a drowner problem, however what he describes isn't typical of drowners. He'll then point you to 2 others you can talk to to learn more: his assistant Rurik, and a widow, Tove.
The assistant (labeled as Boatwright's Apprentice) is right behind where Bjorg was standing and will tell you how his cousin was pulled off the cliffs and into the sea by something. Tove, located at a nearby house, will tell you a similar story of how her husband visited the cliffs regularly and one night didn't come back, and when they found him he was torn to shreds. After talking to both you'll gain 25  as well as 2 different locations to visit on the western coast.
Either location will get you to the next step, but if you want, you can investigate both locations to pick up a trail to follow. At the northern site, a couple drowners will attack near the shore. Kill them off and Geralt will then pick up a stench. This trail can be hard to follow, but essentially stick to the water around the shore until you're just south of the hidden treasure marker and you should see an underwater cave entrance here. You'll then have to swim quite a bit to get inside the cave. The other site is a bit easier, as you just need to examine some baskets and follow it south to the cave entrance nearby and enter it. Note: while you may avoid a fight by not visiting the northern site, there is a worthwhile chest guarded by the monsters there.
Regardless how you enter the cave, you'll come out to the same hallway, just on opposite sides (25 ). This hall has numerous bodies and a few toxic gas clouds, but what you want to examine is the bone near the water entrance and the pelvic bone near the southern entrance. Once done, head into the next room to find several drowners and, after they're dead, examine the rusted armor in the far back corner. Head to the final area, where there's more bodies to examine and, finally, the large wrecked boat on the other side. This will finally lead to Geralt concluding it's a water hag, Abaya. You'll then need to make Drowner pheromones to cover up your scent to set a trap for her (this recipe is automatically added for you when you get to this part).
Craft the pheromones, then use one of them on yourself and go to the marker behind the boats to wait. She'll appear shortly with a couple Drowned dead. With a sufficiently powered Aard she can be knocked on her back and one-shot-killed, along with her minions. Once she's dead, loot her for the Water hag trophy, Daystar, and a Water hag mutagen.
Head back and talk to Bjorg and he'll reward you. If you don't point out you deserve more, he'll only give 187  by default (including if you dealt with Abaya before talking to him). If you instead push for more, he'll reluctantly agree though not happily and give 281 . Of course, since it's possible to haggle for around 300  in the first place, if you did and push for more, he will pay much more than that. Regardless, you'll then earn 250 , concluding the quest.","If quest is started by talking to Bjorg:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Skellige%27s_Most_Wanted,Skellige,"Head to Fyresdal where, in the middle of the village, you'll see a group of Skelligers talking and, on spotting you, one will call you over. Talk to them and he'll dismiss the others' help for yours. You can talk with him a bit before asking what's going on, though he appears to get a lot of geography facts confused and doesn't appear to recognize clan colors. He'll eventually tell you he got attacked by a large group of nekkers and needs you to clear the way. If you haggle, he'll readily agree to the highest amount without question.
With that, head out to the spot northeast of the village to find what looks like a destroyed wagon. However, when you examine the horse and the corpse here, things clearly aren't adding up about the supposed attack. A short cutscene starts where Geralt narrowly avoids being crushed by a boulder. Obviously something weird is going on, so head up the hill to investigate.
A short way up you can examine the fresh furrow made by the boulder, then at the top see where the boulder started which will then pick up a set of nekker tracks. Follow them around until you reach a cave entrance. There are wolves near it and it's possible that they see you, but you don't need to worry about them. Just as you enter the cave, the entrance gets blocked. With no other way out, continue forward into a small pit area. Here, two endrega warriors will spawn and, once killed, six endrega workers before, finally, a venomous arachas. Once all the threats are eliminated, climb up the other ledge and continue following the tracks until Geralt spots a hollowed out nekker boot. You can examine the spot for slightly more dialogue, noting what appears to be a human child's footprint after the boot fell off.
Eventually you'll come to the final room with child-like drawings of not so child-like innocence: drawings of plans to target Geralt and kill him with a boulder and, if that didn't work, the endrega nest, which didn't work either. The last drawing indicates the final meeting place, so time to head out to meet these plotters. You can also examine the nekker body here to see where the boots came from.
Once you head out this door, be careful of nekkers nearby, then make your way northeast to the meeting place at night and enter the ring for a cutscene (earliest time is 8pm). Three beings approach: a godling, an ice troll, and a doppler. Eventually a fourth, a werewolf, will appear, wondering why the witcher isn't dead yet and it quickly becomes clear the others just wanted to scare you while the werewolf wants you and all other witchers to pay for what happened to his partner.
You then have 3 choices here: try to show you have helped monsters before (only shows if you have two or more examples), just fight them, or try to part ways. If you choose any but the first, you'll be forced to fight all but the godling (who runs off) and will net 100  once the three are dead. Note also that this method won't gain any loot from the troll or doppler; only the werewolf will drop loot.
If you instead choose to show you have helped monsters in the past, you'll need to use 2 examples (otherwise you'll be forced to fight them as you don't have enough proof). Note: Helping both Sarah and Johnny only counts as a single example of helping monsters. You can help either or both but you will only be given a single option to say you helped a godling. You must have a second type of monster you helped or the choice to prove you helped monsters will not appear.
The following count as proof if the beings were helped:
spared the trolls at Kaer Morhen (The Final Trial; also default if doing an expansion only playthrough)
let Sarah stay in Novigrad (Novigrad Dreaming; also default if doing an expansion only playthrough)
spared Salma (Contract: Deadly Delights)
spared Wham-a-Wham (Contract: Missing Miners)
spared Imp (Contract: An Elusive Thief)
spared Allgod (A Greedy God) Note that there's a bug where it mislabels this as Fugas.
lifted Morkvarg's curse and spared him (In Wolf's Clothing)
helped Johnny to recover his voice (Ladies of the Wood)
Using 2 examples will cause all to back down save for the werewolf who, blinded by hatred, will attack and force you to fight and kill him. After he's dead, the godling will then approach, remarking how the werewolf used to be different until he lost his partner. She'll then thank you and give you Nekker hide boots and 200 , completing the quest.","If Geralt found the contract first:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Strange_Beast,Skellige,"This quest can be started three different ways:
find the notice on Larvik's notice board
talk directly to Thorleif
inspect the ambush site on the road to the village
If you picked up the notice or talked to Thorleif first, you'll be able to haggle over the reward if you wish before eventually getting pointed over to Sverre and the few other survivors of the attack. Talk to them, though they're not able to reveal much other than whatever attacked them was smart enough to set a trap and ambush the warriors.
Note: This contract pays a lot more than others allowing you to haggle an unusually high amount. It's possible to haggle up to 650 , which can make it the most well paying contract in the base game.
Head out to the ambush site along the road (about halfway to Lofoten). This is also where the quest starts if you found the site first. Here you'll find a cart on the side of the road and several bodies. Examine the body near the cart, then the handle of it to note it looks like blood but is actually red clay. Lastly, examine the body on the other side of the road and Geralt will conclude it's a sentient enough creature leading some nekkers in the area, earning 25 .
After that, tracks will appear in the bushes next to the last body which you can then follow into the woods to a nearby cave. Head in where you'll run into toxic gas clouds that you can either use Aard or Igni to get rid of (the latter if you want an explosive effect). As you near the first turn a nekker will appear, so dispatch of it to continue on. Sometimes another will spawn shortly after so you may have to kill that one as well. Afterwards, continue along to find the nest and drop down to face off against several nekkers to draw out the leader. After these 3 are killed, Hagubman, a nekker warrior, will appear. Periodically he'll burrow away to safety, which will call forth 3-4 nekkers to fight you in the meantime, so it's best to finish him off quickly.
Once Hagubman is dead, loot him for Devine and the Nekker warrior trophy. If you've already talked to Thorleif, you'll be directed to go talk to him. If you haven't talked to him yet (by picking up the quest from the ambush site) you'll need to head into Larvik to find the notice board first. Talk to Thorleif and he'll be pleased, earning you 250  and (by default) 390 , completing the quest.","If Geralt talks to Thorleif before starting the quest:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_The_Phantom_of_Eldberg,Skellige,"You can start this quest a few different ways:
talk to Jorund directly in Arinbjorn's tavern
find the notice on Arinbjorn's notice board
during The King is Dead – Long Live the King, defeat Madman Lugos in a fistfight and he'll remark on it
investigate the area directly
Unless you start the quest by investigating before The King is Dead – Long Live the King, upon entering the tavern you'll run into Kori and Kraki, two Skelligers who obviously don't like Continentals. You can go with whichever remark before Jorund appears and makes them run off before inviting you to come sit with him if you wish. Follow him over to his table and talk to him to learn about the strange circumstances about Eldberg and he'll tell you about two men and the lighthouse keeper, Mikkjal, have gone missing. After that, head out for the island.
Note: the easiest way to reach the target location, unless you already have the Eldberg Lighthouse signpost, is to head north to Arinbjorn's port and get a boat, then fast travel to the harbor on the southern tip of Eldberg. It is also intended to use this route (whether by boat or on foot), as coming from the lighthouse itself you'll likely miss the bodies.
As you make your way along the path, you'll come across wraiths and likely find the first dead body that you can examine. Further along, just before the hut, you'll find the second body. Now go and knock on the hut's door for some dialogue with Mikkjal.
If you talked to Jorund first, Mikkjal will just tell you how he ended up in the hut and about a large wraith before giving you the lighthouse key (25 ). If you found him first by investigating the area directly, he'll instead talk a bit more about what he noticed before he hid in the hut. Afterwards, head to the lighthouse like normal, dealing with any wraiths along the way.
Once at the lighthouse, examine the markings on the tower to learn it's a curse and the large wraith must be a penitent. (25) Geralt will remark about how you have to go back to Mikkjal, but if you want to learn the full story, head into the lighthouse by unlocking the door and head up the ladder to the first landing. Loot the document right in front of you and read it to learn Mikkjal didn't exactly tell you everything.
Important: If you don't unlock the door to the lighthouse now before returning to Mikkjal, the key will be taken from you and the door will stay locked.
Head back to talk to Mikkjal. If you found and read the letter, Geralt will confront him about it first, but if you didn't find it the outcome is the same: you need to escort him as only he can light the fire to lift the curse. A cutscene then follows and Mikkjal runs for the lighthouse, while you're left to deal with the penitent.
Note that while you can attack the penitent, you can't truly kill it until the fire is lit, though Geralt will make a remark when it's done to let you know. It will summon up to 4 regular wraiths to protect it from time to time (and these aren't the weak ones summoned by nightwraiths and noonwraiths), so it will be a tough fight and it helps a lot if you have reliever's and/or griffin decoctions.
Once the penitent is dead, loot it for the wraith trophy and Ashrune. Mikkjal will then approach and, if you found the letter, you can tell him you'll let this slide or tell him to leave. Otherwise, Geralt will just remark he's not sure what brought the penitent there.
However you dealt with Mikkjal, head to Arinbjorn to turn in the quest. If you investigated the area directly (didn't talk to Jorund) you'll need to get the notice off the notice board first and head into the tavern (which follows the same script above where you're initially confronted by Kori and Kraki). Jorund will be glad the problem is solved and rewards you with 260  and 184 , completing the quest. However, what happens next depends on if this is your concluding visit to Jorund and if King's Gambit has already been completed (or failed).
If King's Gambit is already completed/failed, nothing happens. If it's still available though, as you go to leave Kori and Kraki will pull you and Jorund into a fight leading to Jorund's death and Geralt being thrown into jail - this starts the secondary quest Stranger in a Strange Land.","If you talk to Jorund first:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/In_the_Heart_of_the_Woods,Skellige,"You can pick up this quest either through the notice or by finding the group on the road southwest out of Fayrlund.
When you reach the area, you'll find a group of onlookers while several elders and younger men argue around a man's body, mangled by tree branches. Approaching close enough will automatically pull you into the conversation. You can ask them more about the Woodland Spirit and clearly see they're split on what to do, if anything: the elder Harald wishes you to leave the spirit be, claiming it makes the villagers strong warriors, while one of the younger men, Sven, explains it's a common beast that kills anyone that wanders into its territory.
Before you decide on who to back, it's time to investigate to learn what the spirit really is. The trail will lead you out to a spot where you'll find a dead dog to examine, then leads you further west to find another dead body pinned to a rock. The final clue, even further west, will take you to a ring of stones with several wolves. Once they're killed, examine the scratch marks. Once the final clue is examined, Geralt will deduce it's an ancient leshen, earning 10 . You'll then need to open your bestiary and read about the spirit, which will then point you to talk to Harald and Sven.
Head back to town and, if you wish, you can talk to both before you decide on a course of action. Despite it being a leshen, Harald is convinced it's the reason they're the strongest warriors in Skellige, even if it kills off many who set out to do the ritual, and urges you to lay out a sacrifice to reinstate the pact of his ancestors. Sven, naturally, wants to do the opposite and have it killed, but before you can do that you'll need to have the marked one dealt with otherwise it'll be reborn again.
Missable achievement: if you side with Harald, you'll miss out on the Woodland Spirit achievement. If you wish to get it but still side with Harald, do a separate save here.
Side with Harald[]
If you choose to side with Harald, head out to the altar in the woods and, once close enough, five white wolves will spawn that you must defeat. Once they're all dead, loot each of them to get a total of 5 wolf hearts, then place them on the altar. A cutscene will start, indicating the leshen accepted the pact, and netting you 20 .
Now make your way back to Fayrlund to speak to Harald. You can respond to him however you like and he'll reward you before Sven approaches with the other young men, proclaiming they killed off the other elders and are coming after Harald. You can choose to stand down or protect Harald. Note that if you choose to protect him, he can still be killed in the fight so kill them off quickly if you choose this. If you instead stand down, Sven and Geralt will exchanged heated words before the men kill Harald. Regardless which choice you made, you'll earn 50  and 60  and complete the quest here.
Side with Sven[]
If you choose Sven, you'll need to find the marked person. While there's no trail, if you've learned enough about leshens, you know just to follow the crows. In this case, head to the last house to the west to find several crows on the roof and, using your Witcher Senses, once you're close enough Geralt will spot the marked person: Hilde, a young woman that's involved with Sven. Bring the bad news to Sven, who still believes it's one of the elders. Before you reveal who it is, you can tell him the person could simply be exiled or let them be killed. After that, once you reveal it's Hilde, Sven will either agree to let her be killed if you chose the killing method, or inform them to run her out of town and not come back if you chose the exile method.
Regardless what happens to Hilde, you must now head into the woods and destroy the 3 totems to make the leshen appear. The first one won't be protected, but the other two will have several wolves guarding them. After the third is destroyed, head to the designated spot for a cutscene where the woodland spirit reveals itself along with several more wolves.
Note: The totems themselves are enemies and the leshen will attack you through them, so don't wait to kill all the wolves before destroying them.
Once it's dead (50 ) loot it for the Leshen trophy and head back to Fayrlund to speak to Harald.

Read the spy's notes to complete the first objective. The quest will complete at this point if you have already looted the pertinent container in the abandoned hut prior to reading the notes.
For the next objective, head to White Orchard's mill. Go to the shack slightly northeast of the windmill, and climb down to the stairs leading down which are obscured by some loose floorboards.

Here, a couple drowners are gathered around several corpses. Take them out, then loot one of the bodies for the smuggler's notes to start this quest.
The marker will be nearby, in the water. In fact, if you turn in its direction, you'll see a half sunken ship, that's where you're headed. There are about 5 drowners in the water and, once you've cleared them out, dive around the end of the ship that's sunk. The chest will be right around here, near several (empty) containers.

Loot his corpse for an unsent letter and read it, which will then indicate an area to search further out in the river.

Whatever you choose, once the threats are dead, loot the body near the start of the stairs for an unsent letter and a key.
You'll find the chest in question on the platform, underneath the toppled statue here. Note that if you didn't deal with her beforehand, the noonwraith (or nightwraith) will spawn shortly after you step on the platform. Once the chest is unlocked the quest completes.","Read the notes you found.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Bear_School_Gear/Part_3,Velen,"The easiest way to get all the markings on the map is to buy Ibrahim Savi's third map from the armorer at Kaer Trolde, which will add all the areas to look for these diagrams. All the diagrams for this quest are located in Velen and some can be found early on enough, so you might have found them before getting the map.
All the armor diagrams are found in a cave northwest of the Hanged Man's Tree. It is the same cave you can visit during A Deadly Plot and if you don't have that quest active, you'll find several nekkers and a nekker warrior just outside the entrance. Head inside and as the path curves, you'll find a small alcove to the left, with one of the chests here containing the armor, boots, gauntlets, and trousers diagrams.
The steel sword diagram is found at the Ruined Tower and is guarded by an Earth Elemental. However, the monster seems to only spawn after a certain point in the main game story, so you may not have to deal with it. When it's safe, look on one of the broken floor pieces on the eastern side to find the chest (it's half hidden behind a large tree and a nearby bush).
The silver sword diagram is found in a cave on the edges of the bog, southwest of The Orphans of Crookback Bog (the same cave during Contract: Swamp Thing). Note that there's actually 3 entrances into this cave so even if you haven't progressed far enough in the main questline to get The Eye of Nehaleni, you can still get inside. If you don't have the eye, keep heading west until you find a cave marker noting the one open entrance. If you have the eye though, simply use it on the area the quest marker indicated on the map. If you haven't already killed Ignis Fatuus and you took the one open entrance in, you'll have to fight some foglets and Ignis Fatuus himself before you can find the diagram. If you used the hidden entrance the map led you to though, head in to fight a foglet, then stick to the wall on the left to find a body with the chest behind him containing the diagram.","Find the silver sword upgrade diagram using your Witcher Senses.

The steel sword diagram is found northwest of Blackbough, in a cave behind The Pellar's hut (the same cave area the bear is just outside of during A Princess in Distress). If that quest isn't active, you'll find several nekkers here instead. Once they're dead, head inside and, minding the 2 drops, in the large chamber follow the wall on the right past a deer corpse to find the chest behind the column here.
The silver sword diagram is found northeast of Olena's Grove, on the small island with a monster nest. Drowners will continuously spawn here until you take out the nest, so either quickly grab the diagram from the chest in the hole next to the rock or take out the nest first.
The armor diagrams are found at the Destroyed Bastion and guarded by a cyclops. The chest itself can be found near the grindstone, in a small area between several walls, and contains the armor, boots, gauntlets, and trousers diagrams.","Find the steel sword upgrade diagram using your Witcher Senses.

The gauntlets diagram is found at Codgers' Quarry, near one of the Looters group. If you approach with weapon drawn they'll be immediately hostile, but if sheathed, they'll talk but essentially want you to leave, however alghouls suddenly attack ending that conversation. If saved, the men will thank you and you can then head into the cave here to find the chest with the diagram.
The trousers diagram is found in Oxenfurt, in the house just to the east of the blacksmith. Enter the main floor and, near where the cat marker is, climb down the ladder and follow the tunnel into a room with 2 gates on either side. Use your Witcher Senses on the area between the brick wall and the gate on the right to find a brick you can interact with, opening a hidden room on the brick wall. Inside is the chest containing the diagram. However, if you go there after you raided one of Whoreson Junior's business with Cleaver's men, but before you start the quest A Favor for Radovid (Which automatically start after you finish Get Junior and leave that house), the hole would be sealed and you cannot get the diagram until A Favor for Radovid starts.
The steel sword diagram is found in a cave just northeast of Reardon Manor (the same cave during Fools' Gold). If the quest is active, bandits will be just outside the cave and inside as well. If you don't have the DLC though, a bear will be here instead.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Griffin_School_Gear,Velen,"You can start this quest by either finding one of the locations of the diagrams and reading the related documents found with them, or by buying one of the treasure maps available, as all of them will point to starting at Dragonslayer's Grotto. The easiest maps to obtain early on are the first and second from Midcopse's armorer.
Griffin steel sword Diagram[]
This diagram is found at Hindhold and one of the easiest locations to get to early on in the game. Here you'll find the area is guarded by endrega workers and warriors, so kill them off as you make your way up to the top, where a harpy's nest is. You may also find an elven song on the way. Take out the harpies, then pass through the wooden door up here and loot the crate to find and read Witcher George's confession and then loot the skeleton for Balstick's letter and the first piece, Diagram: Griffin steel sword. This will add 2 further locations to explore if you don't have them already.
Griffin silver sword Diagram[]
The lighthouse is more time consuming to get to, and requires traveling all the way to Lornruk at the top end of Crow's Perch region. Here you'll find a wyvern has made the place its home. As it's not a good idea to fight it in the tower, draw it's attention to your side of the bridge and kill it off first, then jump down into the waters below (make sure to look before you jump, as you can die if you hit the rocks below). You'll find drowners in the water near the place of power here marking the entrance into the tower, so kill them then dive down and enter the cave here (should be marked by the cave entrance icon).
Climb up the ledges then the ladder and make your way up until you exit out on the other side of the bridge. With that, turn around to face the door again that you just went through to see another ladder and climb up here to find a chest with Diagram: Griffin silver sword along with crafting notes. While not needed, you can head up the lighthouse tower until you find a chest with Dobromir's journal beside it for a bit more insight.
Armor Diagrams[]
All the armor diagrams are found in Dragonslayer's Grotto, the final resting place for George. Drop down into the area and while you can examine a griffin marker on the archway if you wish, it doesn't do much if you already have the location marked in the quest. Head inside to confront a couple wraiths then make your way down the hall (nothing quest related is off to the area on the right, but you can go in there to face more wraiths to get some loot and possible random diagrams if you want).
Further down the hall you'll soon find a weak wall. Blast it with Aard but don't rush in yet as there's another wraith here as well as toxic gas clouds. Deal with the immediate threat first, then using either Igni or Aard, temporarily dispel the clouds. Halfway through this tunnel you may find more wraiths, so draw them back to a safe area to deal with them, then you should be able to continue all the way to the end unhindered. Before you blast away the rocks here, prepare yourself as an ekimmara is on the other side. Once ready, blast them and face off against the final monster. Once it's dead you'll see there's a number of things you can loot here, but what you want is the chest with the glowing lights, which contains Witcher George's journal and all 4 armor diagrams: armor, boots, trousers, and gauntlets. If you found this location first, the journal will mark the other 2 areas. If you've also completed the main questline far enough to have The Eye of Nehaleni, you can head through the opposite tunnel from where you entered and exit out near the place of power further up the hill.","Note: The order in which these objectives appear may differ depending on the order in which the locations are visited.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Griffin_School_Gear/Part_1,Velen,"While you can find the diagrams by just exploring, an easy way to get all the locations marked is to buy Edwin Greloff's first map from the armorer in Midcopse, which will then reveal them all.
If you bought the map, the closest one is the pirate base bandit camp on the peninsula west of the abandoned site nearby. There's a fair number of pirates here, and while you don't need to kill them all off, you likely will need to do so to get to the chest, which is within the ruins and just up a small flight of stairs and contains the enhanced steel sword diagram.
The next closest is likely at the Burned Ruins (the same location near the Shrieker's cave). For this, just head up to the ruins and, half hidden in the large pile of burnt wood, you'll find a chest with the trousers diagram.
The farthest location is not near a signpost. On the northern end of Mudplough are some unmarked ruins with a forktail flying around the general location of the chest. Once the forktail is dead, look for the chest on the western side of the ruins, in a small, cornered off section of 3 walls and contains the boots diagram.","Find the boots upgrade diagram using your Witcher Senses.

Head to Frischlow where you'll find wraiths have taken up residence and make your way to the southern part of the village to find a guarded treasure in the cemetery where a noonwraith will also make her appearance. Once she's dead, use Aard to clear the way into the small cave and where one of the chests contains the enhanced gauntlets diagram. Note: You may notice sounds of digging at the entrance to the small cave, if you use the Magic lamp here you will witness a ghost using a pickaxe.
The enhanced silver sword diagram is in a cave east of Crossroads. This is the same cave where Contract: Patrol Gone Missing is if you investigated further. Simply head all the way to the end of the cave and where you'll find several bodies and the chest with the diagram inside.

The silver sword diagram is just below Crow's Perch and you may find it during Bloody Baron quest if you took the well to get inside. To get to it, enter the well through Crow's Perch's garden (as the outside cave area may be blocked depending where you're at in the main questline) and head down the ramp until you reach a leveled out area with a pool of water where a water hag may or may not be depending on the quest. Head towards the pool of water but stay on dry land and head right and you'll find the chest at the end of this path.
For the armor, prepare to sail or swim quite a bit. You want to head to the island that's south of Fyke Isle, where a ruin has all but collapsed into the waters below. There are a number of submerged chests in this area, but the easiest way to find the diagram is to stand at the wolf marker and, facing south, use your Witcher Senses and look almost directly down and you'll see a highlighted chest slightly to the left: that's the one you want.
The boots diagram is found at the Grotto in eastern Velen. Head in and take either path (both go to the same chamber, though if you go right, make sure to take the left path at the next split). If you took the left path initially the chest will be just to your right as you enter the chamber, past the stalagmites, while if you took the right path initially it'll be to your left as you enter the large chamber.","Find the silver sword upgrade diagram using your Witcher Senses.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Wolf_School_Gear/Part_5,Velen,"The easiest way to get these marked on the map is to buy the worn-out and faded notes from Éibhear Hattori.
The steel sword diagram you'll need to swim or sail out to, as it's out in the waters far west of Byways and marked by the sunken ship's mast (and also the location of a sunken treasure marker). Drowners tend to spawn around here and while the wolf marker is in the captain's cabin, the chest you need is below deck, so swim down the stairs and the chest will be right behind them.
The armor diagram is just to the southeast of Byways, at some unmarked elven ruins. The chest you're looking for is in one of the fountains on the ground level (the left one if looking towards the stairs with the elven archway decoration). Wraiths may spawn here if you move closer towards the chest up on the stairs (as they're related to the guarded treasure marker).
The silver sword diagram is located at a hidden treasure marker south-southwest of Kimbolt Way, but guarded over by a fiend. You'll need to kill it so you can then loot a corpse near the wooden door for a key and notes. Once you have the key, go unlock the door and you'll find the chest in the far back of the small room here.","Find the steel sword upgrade diagram using your Witcher Senses.

There are a number of chests here with a total of up to 14 random diagrams as well as a chest with Diagram: Enhanced Wolven armor. However, the chest you want for this quest is in a submerged area with another chest (not the one with a hole in the ground).

Gwent: Old Pals
Master Armorers
Never Trust Children"
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Cat_School_Gear,Novigrad,"You can start this quest either by finding one of the diagrams, finding Julia Kenyon's diary, or buying one of the associated maps, with the first or second in Blackbough, the third in Crow's Perch, and the fourth in Lindenvale.
Armor diagrams[]
All the armor diagrams are found below Temple Isle, though the way to find it is a bit tricky. On your map note the furthest western house on the island (2 buildings over from the marker if you have it on). You want to head to that house and, on the western side of it, you'll find a rock ledge that drops down to a grassy path, this is the path you want to use.
Follow the path all way to the end, where you'll need to use The Eye of Nehaleni to reveal the cave entrance, and head in. The main chamber inside has a golem guarding the area, so kill it off to continue exploring. You don't need to explore the path to the right when you first entered the area (the one with a blocked archway) but if you want you can head in to find Invoice for a golem on a skeleton here, just be prepared to face a wraith after you get it.
The main door in the chamber is locked, so instead make your way down the tunnel opposite of where you entered to find several statues around an open floor area. While not needed, you can pick up the research notes near one of the statues, and mysterious recipe in the corner. Note also a wraith may spawn here and attack. The puzzle itself is simple: you just need to make all the statues face the center of the room by pulling on the levers (thankfully each statue is only controlled by a lever next to it, so you just need to focus on making them face the right direction). Once done, the floor will open up in the center revealing a deep pool with 3 drowners. You'll need to kill them off and then dive down to grab a key at the bottom.
With that, head back to the main chamber to open the door here to find on the far end Mad Kiyan. As he was a witcher, he will use some signs, like Quen, so be prepared for that as he'll attack you on sight. You can then loot him for the armor, boots, gauntlets, and trousers diagrams as well as moonblade and laboratory notebook. Reading this notebook will add the location west of Grassy Knoll if it hasn't already been found.
Crossbow diagram[]
Prepare to swim or sail a fair distance here, as the location is on a small island southwest of the Lighthouse and northwest of Widows' Grotto. Here you'll find the Flying Stag. Climb onto it then head down the stairs to find the chest nearby with the crossbow diagram and mage's notes. Reading this will add Est Tayiar as another location to check out as well as Temple Isle. The captain's log can be looted from a skeleton on the island's shore for further story information.
Feline silver sword diagram[]
Head to Est Tayiar and carefully drop down through the hole here to the bottom to find on one side a weakened wall. Use Aard on it to reveal a small area with a skeleton containing the silver sword diagram and Professor Sigismund Gloger's notes. Reading this will point to Drahim Castle.
Feline steel sword diagram[]
Head to Drahim Castle and blast away the wooden door, then climb down the ladders until you reach the lowest floor. The steel sword diagram is here along with Prince Adrien's journal. Reading this will add the Est Tayiar and the shipwreck off Grassy Knoll locations.","Find the diagrams to all the elements of Cat School witcher gear. 7/7
If diary is found before the quest concludes:
Read Julia Kenyon's diary.
Explore the passages under Temple Isle.
Read the laboratory log.
Search the wreck of the ""Flying Stag.""
Read the mage's notes.
Explore the ruins of Est Tayiar.
Read Professor Gloger's note.
Explore the ruins of Drahim Castle.
Read Prince Adrien's journal."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Cat_School_Gear/Part_1,Novigrad,"The easiest way to get all the markers on the map is to buy Adalbert Kermith's first map from Blackbough's gwent merchant.
The silver sword diagram is found just inside Oxenfurt Gate. The marker here can be a little confusing as it's up on the grassy ledge area just inside Novigrad. Climb up here then, behind the trees, you should find a ladder to climb up to enter someone's home. Make your way up to the next floor and you should find the diagram in the chest here.
The armor diagram is found at Aeramas' Abandoned Manor. Head up to the top floor here and you'll find a chest with the diagram in it.
The boots diagram is found in a large cave to the east of Toderas (the same cave where Contract: Phantom of the Trade Route takes place). Head into the cave and as you near the end of the tunnel and start to reach the main chamber, you'll see the chest to the right, slightly hidden if you're coming from the northern cave entrance (if you reach the area where the survivors are you've gone too far, unless you entered through the southern entrance, in which case it's further past them).","Find the boots upgrade diagram using your Witcher Senses.

All the armor diagrams are located at an unmarked ruin southwest of Dragonslayer's Grotto and guarded over by an Earth Elemental. Once it's dead, you can find the chest in the largest part of the remains, situated between 3 walls, and contains the armor, boots, gauntlets, and trousers diagrams.
The silver sword diagram is found east of Ursten, at a monster den. Here you'll find a large number of nekkers. As you head inside and go down a second set of stairs you'll also encounter a rabid rock troll and more nekkers. Kill them off, then look to the right from where you entered (facing into the chamber that the troll was in) and you'll see a small ledge behind the columns here. Climb up and destroy the small stalagmites to find the chest behind them with the diagram.
The steel sword diagram is found at the Cavern. Head in to find a golem guarding the chest so kill it off, then loot the chest off the wooden platform here for the diagram.","Find the steel sword upgrade diagram using your Witcher Senses.

Enter the house near the monster nest and sea to find a chest with a letter in it, which will point to a location out in the waters roughly in the middle of the small channel to the southwest. Swim or take a boat out there, just be careful of the few sirens here. Once the threats are taken care of, look for the submerged chest that's along the side of the boat to complete the quest.","Read the well-worn letter.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Ironsides%27_Treasure,Skellige,"Head to the hidden treasure marker southeast of Grotto (and far north of Faroe) to find a skeleton and a ruined boat. Loot the skeleton for the notes about treasure and read it to find the next location just east of where you are.
The area is guarded by a couple sirens, so deal with them if necessary then, roughly in the middle of the search area, you'll find the sunken longboat and it's one chest, which contains Gynvael Aedd.","Read the notes you found.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Nilfgaardian_Treasure,Skellige,"To start, go to the far southeast shore of An Skellig to find the hidden treasure marker, a body on a wrecked longboat. Note that there are a couple sirens in the vicinity so you might have to deal with them first. Loot the corpse for a cargo list and read it to learn the location of the treasure is just southeast, out in the ocean.
Swim out to the area and you'll find the chest on the sunken boat here, near the other end of the boat.","Read the notes you found.
Find the sunken treasure using your Witcher Senses."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Not_Only_Eagles_Dare,Skellige,"Head to Ulula's Needle on Spikeroog to find a hidden treasure marker and several mucknixers. Once they're killed off, loot the body here for a note and key and read the note to update the search area. Note that in some cases, a drowned dead will spawn nearby once you killed off the mucknixers but if you're far enough away, it won't automatically target you so sometimes you can avoid it here.
Thankfully the chest is nearby on the outer edge of the search area, but depending, you may run into a siren or two here. Once you loot the chest the quest will complete.
This quest occurs at a location also used for one of the objectives in the secondary quest, Possession and can be completed at the same time. The aforementioned sirens are part of that quest.","Read the note you found.

"https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Ruins,_Hidden_Treasure,_You_Know...",Skellige,"To start this quest, go to Dorve Ruins and, just as you enter the village from the signpost, look to the left to see a skeleton. Loot it for an old key and a mysterious map, with the document pointing you to the tower at the other end of the village. While a wraith will spawn after you loot the skeleton, if you move away quickly enough it won't notice you by the time it spawns.
Head to the tower, which is guarded by several sirens, and kill them off. Once dead, enter and climb up the ladder here to reach the chest. You'll need to click twice on it: once to unlock and a second time to loot it.","Unfold the treasure map.
Use the map to find the treasure."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Bear_School_Gear,Skellige,"While not needed, the easiest way to get one of the markers is buy one of Ibrahim Savi's maps from Kaer Trolde's armorer. If you don't do the map though, you can start the quest instead by finding one of the diagrams.
Probably the easiest to get to when you first arrive in Skellige is to head to Fort Etnir, an unmarked location north of Rogne, however this area has a couple gargoyles and an ice elemental guarding it. Once they're out of the way, head into the eastern room to find a skeleton and a letter nearby. Loot the letter, then loot the skeleton for another letter and the silver sword diagram. After reading this letter, it'll point you to the other Ard Skellig location on the southern end, Ruined Inn.
Head to the Ruined Inn where, if you haven't already cleared out the site, you may have to deal with some sirens to get to the inn. Just down the stairs though you'll find a couple wraiths to contend with, so make quick work of them to explore the area. You'll find yet another arrest warrant nailed to the walls here but the chest itself is in one of the rooms and contains the steel sword diagram as well as some notes. Reading these will point you to a cave on Spikeroog.
This cave, located south-southwest of the Old Watchtower, is the same one during Contract: Here Comes the Groom. Head into the cave where a drowner will soon try to attack you right near a small fork in the path. Once it's dead, head to the right and up the ledge, carefully jumping and climbing until you see the glowing lights around a skeleton across a gap. Jump over to it then loot the skeleton for the crossbow diagram and a letter.
This letter (if you haven't gotten one of the maps) will point you to Clan Tuirseach's former castle on An Skellig and the location of the last 4 diagrams. The location is near Yngvar's Fang, though you can also get to it from the Trail to Yngvar's Fang instead. This is also the same location for the secondary quest, The Path of Warriors, which can be completed concurrently.
Make your way to the bottom floor of the ruins to find a door that leads into the interior but the archway is blocked by an iron gate. With that, head down the stairs to enter a large dungeon area and a lone wraith will spawn as you near the first cell doors. There'a a ballad you can also loot off a skeleton halfway down the hall here that'll tell you Gerd's fate.
Make your way to the end and turn right to see a lever on the wall. When ready, interact with it and while it'll open all the cell doors, it'll also cause a couple more wraiths to spawn. If you want to find the loot in the other cells, ignore the first one to the left from where you pulled the lever (the one with a hole in the ground). Once the rest are looted, head down this hole and make your way through the tunnel where yet another wraith will spawn as you reach the intersection. Head up the stairs and ledges and then use Aard on the rocks to blast your way into the room behind the iron gate. The chest is right across from you in the other corner and contains the armor, boots, gauntlets, and trousers diagrams, as well as another ballad and another document.","Find all the diagrams to Bear School witcher gear. 7/7

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Bear_School_Gear/Part_1,Skellige,"The easiest way to get all the markings on the map is to buy Ibrahim Savi's first map from the armorer at Kaer Trolde, which will add all the areas to look for these diagrams.
All locations are on Ard Skellig this time though spaced out. The boots diagram is found in an unmarked cave southeast of Wild Shore (the same cave Farting Trolls is found in). Unfortunately these trolls aren't civil and will try to attack you so kill them off then look around the rubble where you'll find the chest with the diagram near a broken boat.
The armor diagram is found in the Grotto (the same cave that's part of The Sad Tale of the Grossbart Brothers). Make your way all the way around to the last chamber and where the three brothers are, then kill them off. The chest in question is in the southern part of the chamber, near one of the bed mats.
The silver sword diagram is found at an unmarked ruin northeast of Kaer Gelen. You'll likely be attacked by a group of harpies as you enter this fortress, so take care of them before proceeding further, as just as you head into the interior, alghouls appear. Make your way through the ruins and the tunnel before you find the last room with yet more alghouls. After they're defeated, you can find the chest opposite of where you entered.","Find the silver sword upgrade diagram using your Witcher Senses.

The gauntlets are found on Ard Skellig, at an unmarked ruin northeast of Rogne and southeast of Fort Etnir. Head up the stairs on the north side to the tower here to find the chest with the gauntlets diagram.
The steel sword is located at Kaer Almhult, on a small island to the west of Eldberg Lighthouse. The former prison is crawling with pirates and guard dogs so be prepared for a tedious fight here. From the main entrance into the courtyard area, head behind the overturned wagon to the right and go up the stairs. The chest is at the end of the small hallway here, containing the steel sword diagram.
Note: If you have the signpost marker for the island, but haven't cleared it of all enemies yet, fast-travelling there will put you in the middle of a pirate group.
The trousers location requires some sailing to get to, as it's on an island northeast of Marlin Coast. On the southern side, near the middle, you'll find a small cave that you'll need to swim into to find the chest, which contains the trousers diagram.","Find the gauntlets upgrade diagram using your Witcher Senses.

For these you're headed back to Skellige. The steel sword diagram will likely be the easiest one to find early on, as it's at Kaer Gelen on Ard Skellig. From the gated entrance head around to find the other entrance on the eastern side and where several wraiths will spawn as you enter. After they're dead, continue on until you reach the cat symbol and head up the stairs on the right. Just before you reach the next small landing, to your left you should see a small opening: go in here to find the chest with the diagram.
The other two locations are on Faroe Isle. The silver sword diagram is in a cave east of Harviken, just below the area where Jutta an Dimun is fighting. It is marked as a monster den, but there are no monsters inside. Head inside and use Aard on the farthest wall (the one on the left just has minor loot inside). Follow the short tunnel to the end to find the chest with the diagram inside it.
All the armor diagrams are located south-southwest of Trottheim, in a cave on the southern shore. Similarly to the previous one, there are no monsters in the cave despite it being a monster den, although you might have to fight some sirens and harpies before you can safely enter. Once inside, you can ignore the statues here (they're not needed for this quest) and head left from them to find a chest just behind a column with a skeleton next to it and contains the armor, boots, gauntlets, and trousers diagrams.","Find the steel sword upgrade diagram using your Witcher Senses.

The silver sword diagram is found near Elverum Lighthouse on the southern tip of Ard Skellig, in a large cave. As you head in through the unmarked entrance, go right at the first split and continue to follow it all the way to the final room. The diagram is in one of the chests in the area behind the tomb.
All the armor diagrams are found in the top northeastern part of Ard Skellig, near Giants' Toes. There's a medium sized group of pirates/bandits here though all along the coastline, so kill them off and make your way to the last campfire and you should find the chest among the rocks nearby, containing the armor, gauntlets, trousers, and boots.
Note: Near the bandit camp chest, there are a couple of sacks full of herbs worth looting. They are random, but can contain some of the rarest ones like Bison grass.
The steel sword diagram is found on An Skellig, west of Yngvar's Fang, though it might be easier to fast travel to Urialla Harbor and ride Roach to the spot instead. You'll likely be spotted by some bandits nearby, so kill them off as you approach the stone shrine with the griffin marking carved into it. The chest with the diagram is just behind the stone.","Find the steel sword upgrade diagram using your Witcher Senses.

All of them can be found on Ard Skellig this time, though spaced out. The silver sword diagram is found at the ruins east of Fornhala, Kaer Dhu. An ulfhedinn (though mislabeled as Werewolf) will be there at night, but if you wish to avoid the fight, simply visit the site during daytime. Look in the western tower to find the chest with the diagram in the small area to the left of the archway.
The steel sword diagram is located in Boxholm, in the ruins east of the signpost. If you've done Contract: Missing Son already, this is the same area where Morvudd runs off to. In this area, climb up the eastern wall and the chest with the diagram is to the north, under some rubble.
All the armor diagrams are found together in the ruins northeast of Redgill and southeast of Whale Graveyard. There's a cyclops here who's not thrilled you're invading his space though so kill him off to safely explore the ruins (just mind the open side to the ocean as you could fall to your death there). Once dead, look for the griffin marker on the boulders just outside the ruins on the north side and then climb up these boulders to reach the second floor of the ruins. Carefully head in as there's a hole in the middle of this room to find 2 chests and an aard place of power, with one of the chests containing the armor, boots, trousers, and gauntlets diagrams.","Find the steel sword upgrade diagram using your Witcher Senses.

The silver sword diagram is found just southeast of Arinbjorn, at some unmarked burial mounds, in the most western mound (in case you're trying to find the wolf marker, it's on the ceiling above the archway). The chest itself is to the left, next to the large, wooden tub.
The armor diagram is found at Fort Grymmdjarr, an unmarked ruin to the southwest of Fyresdal. Here, harpies have made it their home though, so you'll need to kill them off first to search around. The marker here is also on the ceiling, but the chest isn't on the ground level. Instead, from the archway facing into the interior, head right on the outside of the fort until you can jump over the wooden barrier (it'll be right before the first tower) then follow it to the left until you reach the end and where the chest is.
The steel sword diagram is on Hindarsfjall, to the southwest of Lofoten, though you have to find either the ledge to the north of the ruins or southwest to get up to them. You'll likely find a hostile ice troll in the vicinity so deal with the threat, then head down the hole near the marker into the ruin's lower levels. While there's no enemies down here, there's highly toxic gas clouds here that tend to re-appear very quickly.

For the gauntlets diagram, head to Kaer Nyssen, the ruined fortress overlooking Boxholm. However, be careful here if you haven't done Contract: Missing Son yet, as a powerful fiend, Morvudd, is here as well. If he is, you'll need to fight him enough to make him run off before you can look around. Facing the wolf marker, go left and all the way to the corner here where some containers are, then climb up the northeastern wall, then head back right and you should see the chest at the other end, against the tower.
The trousers diagram is found at the Old Watchtower on Spikeroog and where a group of bandits have set up camp. Kill them all off then, facing the wolf marker, look up and to the right and you'll see the chest you need to get to. To do so, you can simply position yourself just below it then jump up and Geralt should climb up.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Shortcut,Skellige,"On Undvik, head to the hidden treasure marker on the northern shore of the lake by Urskar (east of it and west of the Dorve Ruins signpost), to find several bandits around a boat. Once they're dead, loot the bag on the small boat for the torn piece of paper and read it to start the quest.
Head out to the marker area (where you can see part of a ship sticking out of the water) and dive down to loot the chest here, which contains Bloed Aedd.","Read the notes you found.
Search for treasure on the bottom of the lake using your Witcher Senses."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Unlucky%27s_Treasure,Skellige,"Go to Snidhall Isle north of the Ancient Crypt. Find the pathway on the east side of the island and make your way up the hills. It will lead you to an archgriffin's nest with a hidden treasure marker right in the middle of it.
This archgriffin is no joke: it's strongly recommended you be around the same level or higher as, in the base game, it can be very hard to kill it before it kills you. Particularly, if it has the skull icon it will probably be able to kill you in two hits at most, so prepare for a tough fight. You can also lure it away, then quickly loot the nest and the chest or, while it is flying over water, hit the archgriffin with a well-timed crossbow shot, Aard or even Axii.[1] As it is not a swimming creature, this results in an instant death.
Once the archgriffin is dead, loot the body in the nest for the notes and a skullhead key, then head north towards the other summit to find a few more bodies around the treasure chest. Loot it to complete the quest.","Read the document you found on the body.
Search the area using your Witcher Senses to find the treasure."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/X_Marks_the_Spot,Skellige,"This quest starts at an unmarked, abandoned hut southeast of Blandare. The best way to find it is to head east from the hidden treasure marker in this area (north of the small lake) and go slightly south to see the hut. A white bear will be between it and the lake so be careful if you don't want to fight it.
Enter the hut and examine the skeleton here and loot the key and map to start the quest. Shortly after a wraith will spawn but depending if you left the building quickly, you may not have to fight it.
The chest location is just southeast of Fayrlund, where the hidden treasure marker is, and the chest is right at the base of the waterfall. A Wolf School symbol is carved to the rockside near it, making it highly visible when using the Witcher Senses. Note that you have to interact with this chest twice: once to unlock and a second time to actually loot it.","Unfold the map.
Follow the map to find the treasure."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Forgotten_Wolf_School_Gear_Diagrams,Kaer_Morhen,"To find Osmund's notes, head into the Kaer Morhen keep and just inside, you'll see some bookshelves to the left. Climb up the nearby ladder to the second level and you'll find both Osmund's notes and Vesemir's note on a bookshelf at the other end of the platform. Read the two notes and this will then give access to the mastercrafted and grandmaster levels of the entire set.","Find Osmund's notes in Kaer Morhen.
Read Osmund's notes.
Read Vesemir's notes."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Wolf_School_Gear,Kaer_Morhen,"The easiest way to get the markers on the map is to buy one of the maps, with the easiest one early on being the slightly torn notes from Lindenvale's blacksmith, but Hattori sells a map too.
Armor diagrams[]
The armor diagrams are in the old signal tower, an unmarked location just south of the Kaer Morhen signpost. However, as it's up a steep cliff, you'll need to ride down the valley some and then back up to get to it. As you make your way up the steps to the tower a couple erynias may attack if they spot you here.
Note: As you will have to reach this same pathway later, in order to avoid repeating the climb, it is convenient to call Roach here and ride northwest to at least acquire the Bastion fast-travel signpost.
Head in and go straight, climbing up over the wall, to find some scaffolding here. Climb up to the first level to find Hieronymus' notes in a chest, which will add the Ruined Watchtower and the Bastion as other areas to check out, as well as noting you need to examine the portal mechanism. While not needed, you can also loot the nearby skeleton for Pang of Conscience and a letter of apology. There's also a random relic sword in the chest on the ledge below.
You can then examine the portal area on the ground level if you wish, though you need the polished crystal, so head back the way you entered the tower but this time climb through the crack in the wall on the right (if facing the exit). Carefully walk through here and climb up onto the scaffolding on the outside of the tower and near the end, look up to see the crystal on a ledge to grab it. Head back and interact with the mechanism to add it, then hit it with Aard to charge it. Do not try to jump through the portal yet though, as it's not stable enough (indicated by it flickering). You'll need to hit the other mechanism opposite the one you just charged up and that'll stabilize the portal. Once done, jump through it and it'll spit you out in a cave. As you near the cave exit a wraith will spawn here, so kill it off and then loot the skeleton here for the armor, boots, gauntlets, and trousers diagrams as well as some notes. Be careful at the cave exit, as there are stone platforms to safely drop to, but it is also easy to accidentaly slide into death even when targeting them properly.
Steel sword diagram[]
Head to the Bastion where, if you haven't already visited it, wraiths will come out to greet you so make quick work of them, then head inside. In the burned wooden remains you'll find a skeleton containing the steel sword diagram and Varin's journal.
Silver sword diagram[]
Head now to the Ruined Watchtower on the northern end of the valley where yet another wraith will spawn. After it's dead, loot the skeleton it'd spawned near for the silver sword diagram and a journal.
This is also the location for the Enhanced steel sword diagram, so it is convenient to start Scavenger Hunt: Wolf School Gear/Part 2 by picking it up as well. It's up on one of the scaffoldings around.","Find the diagrams to all elements of Wolf School witcher gear. 6/6

For the gauntlets diagram, head all the way south to a cave in Kaer Morhen valley in the southeastern part of the region. Enter the cave and head right then left and up the ledge here to the main chamber. The chest is just to the left, partially hidden by the plants.
The trousers diagram is to the north-northeast of Lakeside Hut, on the small island at the mouth of the inlet. The chest itself is actually in the water: from the wolf marker, look south and you should see it there in the water (you may need to use your Witcher Senses to help highlight it).

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Wolf_School_Gear/Part_4,Kaer_Morhen,"The easiest way to get these marked on the map is to buy the heavily faded notes from Hierarch Square's armorer.
The trousers diagram is found in a cave northwest of Kaer Morhen and north of the Bastion. Head inside and follow the path, where along the way you'll come across a few nekker warriors and a devourer. From the area where you can come across the first table apparatuses and mutagen bottles, go just past the one on the left and you'll see the chest behind the stalagmites (you've gone too far if you reach the small set of stairs). Although not requried, there is interesting commentary by Geralt when you examine various things in the cave, and you can also find Trial of the Grasses registry tome. When you exit the cave, there will be harpies on the road back, if they didn't spawn there previously.
The gauntlets diagram is found at Iron Mine. Head in but be careful as an Earth Elemental is in the main room. Once it's killed you'll find the diagram on the small altar like table near the hidden tunnel. The Iron Mine is also the location for The Witchers' Forge, and can be completed at the same time.
The boots diagram requires a bit of manual traveling/swimming, as it's in a cave to the east of the keep and not near any signposts. Once you enter the cave you can find the wolf marker just behind the small waterfall on the left, then head right the drop down to the lower level and fight any endrega warriors and workers here. Once it's safe, from where you dropped down (facing into the cavern), follow the wall on the right and go around the large stone column here and on the other side, behind more stalagmites, you'll see the chest. This is the same are of the cave as where you fight a Chort during Berengar's Blade, so you can save a trip if you do both quests at the same time, though that quest will fail if not completed before The Isle of Mists.","Find the gauntlets upgrade diagram using your Witcher Senses.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Evil%27s_Soft_First_Touches,Main_quests,"While visiting the notice board by the Seven Cats Inn you will see someone hanging a new contract on it. After a short conversation you can pick it up and read it, then go see Olgierd von Everec about the contract. When you get inside the residence his ""friends"" will mock Geralt and you can tell them you're there on business or mock them back and start a fistfight with one of them. If you choose the latter, winning the fistfight yields 150.
After all is said and done one of them will take you to Olgierd. You'll talk a lot before he reveals that his cook was killed by a monster when she went looking for a prince turned into a toad beneath the sewers of Oxenfurt. If you try to haggle, he will agree to pay 450 for the job. (150) Afterwards, as you exit the manor a woman will stop Geralt and offer him another job. If you agree this will start the Rose on a Red Field quest.
A Sewer Full of Surprises[]
Enter the Sewer through a well at the Oxenfurt market. When you descend, you can use your Witcher Senses to find lots of footprints - most are male, but one will be female. You're supposed to follow them, but there's only one possible route, so don't worry about that. You'll have to kill a drowner or two, but soon you will meet Shani who will be trying to save some soldier's life, but unfortunately he's already dead. After a conversation she will ""agree"" to be your guide and you'll find yourself in front of a locked grate door. Aard away the wall to one of its sides to continue.
Soon you will find more of the dead soldiers and Shani will tell you who had the key to the lower sewers. You can simply jump down the hole, but you will then miss out on conversations with Shani and minor items along the way. Find the Key to sewer gates on a corpse and return to the locked gate to open it. Soon you will find more bodies and drowners in the sewer tunnels. After getting rid of them, Geralt will examine one of the bodies and deduce the monster likes alcohol. You then have to fight more drowners to reach the lair. A cutscene will start and Geralt will use alcohol on a dead corpse to lure out the monster, after which the The Toad Prince will appear. Your potions and bombs will be automatically be replenished when the cutscene ends.
Fighting The Toad Prince[]
This can be a surprisingly tough fight. Don't expect it to be easy just because it's the first boss of the main story, it actually sets the tone for difficulty throughout the entire Hearts of Stone expansion.
The Prince will hop around a lot and knock you back. He also attacks from range with his tongue and regularly spits venom, sometimes using it almost as artillery fire. Even if you dodge that, it will leave poisonous fumes at times, so Golden Oriole is a must and if you have the superior version, you can use it to heal.
Northern Wind is effective, but has limited charges and this is a long fight. Instead, Yrden can be repeatedly used to pin the toad down for short spells and is very reliable. If you have Magic Trap unlocked, it will also work if it hits him. Also, if your sword has Replenishment, then charging it with Yrden will also work. If you have Active Shield unlocked, you can use it with Ancient leshen decoction to build up a massive stamina regeneration rate making the fight much more easy. You shold have Acquired Tolerance unlocked to drink more than one decoction. In which case use Archgriffin decoction as it will greatly reduce the duration of the fight as the Toad has a ton of health. Cursed oil isn't very effective for damage without the Archgriffin decoction, but excellent for defense with Protective Coating.
Once you build up your stamina regeneration, use Yrden to pin down the Toad. While you can't place multiple traps at once you can create a regular and enhanced version at same time. The enhanced sign is better as it will pin the Toad when it strikes it and can protect you against some of the ranged attacks, but it also takes longer to use. Regardless, once the Toad is pinned run up to it and use strong attacks or whirl. Even if you manage to land only 1 hit it should do more than enough damage due to the Archgriffin decoction. Rinse and repeat until you win.
After the Toad prince goes down to around 5% HP, a cutscene will play where it turns out he really was a prince. Geralt will slit the belly of the toad and will be covered in a toxic substance rendering him unconscious. The dead prince will transform back into his human form with his belly sliced open. Ofieri soldiers will then appear out of the tunnels to see this scene and, angry that Geralt killed their prince, they take him away to answer for his actions. (600)
Gaunter O'Dimm[]
Geralt will awaken in a prison cell aboard the Albatross ship to find he has been captured by soldiers from Ofir. You'll be talking to another prisoner, who introduces himself as Phelippe Calagrande and explains that he was a guide for the Ofieri soldiers in their search for the prince. Phelippe speaks Ofieri and will be able to translate the foreign language being spoken. The guards will interrupt to leave a bowl of food and insult Geralt. It turns out the soldiers pledged their honor to the king to return the prince back home alive. Now that Geralt has killed the prince, they are hoping to keep their honor by taking Geralt to Ofir to be executed. Geralt wants to speak to the captain and will ask Phelippe how to say the correct phrase, who will say Vhajlth alle'khe uhl eghullath. Right after this, a timed choice will appear and you will have to try and recall the phrase. Geralt will say the first word Vhajlth and then be given three choices as to how to finish the phrase:
...alle'khe yhll eghallith!
...alle'ghe urh yghilleth!
...alle'khe uhl eghullath!
The bottom choice is the correct one, and you get 200 for picking it. If you get the phrase wrong, you only speak gibberish and the guards laugh at you. Either way, the guards won't get you to their captain.
After Geralt gets ""fed"" by the soldiers, Phelippe will go to sleep and Gaunter O'Dimm will appear. He will offer to help in exchange for a favor. With no other option, Geralt will agree and Gaunter will then mark Geralt with a symbol on his face. Gaunter will make good on his promise, although in a quite unexpected way.
A storm erupts, leading to the ship to crashing and when Geralt wakes up he will be dragged along a beach by the soldiers. Geralt eventually frees himself and you'll now be fighting the remaining soldiers and a mage. This is optional and you can run away, but defeating them gives 200 and there's a lot of loot around too. A few things of note, if you choose to fight:
You start wearing only your trousers, boots and steel sword. However, all your gear is in your inventory and you can re-equip it immediately, as well as any oils or bombs. Similarly to the Toad fight, your potions and bombs will replenish at the start too.
The soldiers aren't hard to deal with alone and the mage himself will knock them down while targeting you. The mage is the actual threat here, but he won't take damage before you kill the soldiers. Be sure to avoid his deadly sand twister attack. You can interrupt it with Aard, but take care not to get too close.
Bleeding and poison effects are very effective against the mage since he constantly disappears/teleports away.
For some reason the dimeritium bomb has little effect against the mage, so using it wouldn't give you an advantage.
The mage is fairly easy once you learn how his attacks work. All of his magic attacks can be dodged and once you get close to him, you can land quite many hits, but don't do it for long as he will push you back with magic. However, you can dodge that magic push by moving back and then landing strikes on him again.
If you're having trouble, you can again rely on stamina regeneration. Ekhidna decoction is very useful for healing and you can stun the mage with Axii. Outside of that, just be patient as the mage teleports a lot and you have to wait for the right moment to strike.
After defeating the mage, you're free to loot chest that the soldiers dropped, as well as the crashed ship nearby.
Now it's time to meet Gaunter, as agreed. Go to Yantra where you will find some kids singing a very interesting song. Gaunter won't be here until at least 11PM, so you may have to meditate. When the meeting happens, he will reveal that Olgierd knew who the Toad Prince really was and that he is in debt to him too. However, before he can claim his debt, he must fulfill 3 tasks for Olgierd through a proxy, which is how he expects Geralt to pay his own debt. No matter what you say, you're left with no choice but to agree, even though Geralt makes no promises. You're then off to see Olgierd. (300)
Contract Fulfilled[]
Note: If you don't go to see Gaunter at Yantra and skip to this part, you will encounter him here and the dialogue differs slightly, including an option to mention the burning mansion. However, there are no real consequences for doing this and you even get the  still.
Return to the Garin Estate to collect your pay, only to find it engulfed in flames and two of Olgierd's band members are about to kill one of their own for apparently violating the chivalric code. The first set of dialogue choices makes no difference in the outcome, but the second choice is important. If you threaten them (""Let him go or face my wrath""), Olgierd comes out of the burning house and challenges Geralt to a duel for the man's life. If you choose any of the other two options, Olgierd instead asks what's going on, which distracts Geralt and the man gets decapitated.
Fighting Olgierd (optional)[]
Do not underestimate Olgierd as he is the toughest human opponent you'll ever face. Especially on Death March as his attacks are capable of quickly taking out the whole health bar which makes Quen your best friend in this fight.
Olgierd fights similar to Ciri in some respects, as he can teleport around and do something similar to her Charge attack. However, if you manage to strike him while he is charging at you or if you parry him while he is charging at you, he will start choking. This allowes you to land three free hits (strong attacks recommended) on him, but after the third one he will throw sand at you, so you should be prepared to avoid. Aard, Igni and Yrden magic traps can also choke him if used when he charges. As with the Toad prince, he also has a lot of health thus using the Archgriffin decoction is recommended. However, you should only use strong attacks if you cause Olgierd to choke, otherwise he may block your attack and will only use up your stamina.
There are two easiest ways to make Olgierd choke - reactive and proactive:
The reactive way is to parry one of the two charged teleportation attacks that Olgierd usually tries from distance. The first is a top-down sword attack, and the second is a zig-zag attack, during which Olgierd tries to hit Geralt from behind. In both cases, you just need to press the block button after the opponent appears near you. In the case of the zig-zag attack, you don't need to turn around.
The proactive way is to provoke a mistake on Olgerd's part. Attack him three times with quick hits. He will block each of them, but after the third block in a row he will throw sand - dodge it. Then Olgierd will start preparing a charged non-teleportation attack and this is your opportunity to hit him with one strong attack or 1-2 quick ones, or use a sign.
Both ways will trigger a choking animation, allowing you to follow up with sequence of three strong attacks (also you can cast Igni once between them). After the third strong hit, be ready to roll back (better option) or dodge the sand.
Note: If you immediately roll back after the third strong hit (during his choking), he will attempt a teleportation top-down sword attack, which was already mentioned in reactive way and which you should parry. As a result, it puts Olgierd in a deadly loop from which he is very rarely able to escape. And even if he does, it is not difficult to provoke a new choking.
In general, almost his entire move-set can be parried letting you get a heavy follow up in. If specced into ""Counterattack"", it should only take five to seven parries & follow ups depending on critical strikes.
Unfortunately though, there's no reward for defeating him. Not even a regular kill .
Final conversation[]
Whether you fought him or not, it is revealed that Olgierd is immortal and you will get your promised 450 , as well as 400, after which Gaunter appears. You can ask about the Toad Prince and Gaunter will reveal how that whole thing happened. After that, Olgierd will send him away and talk with Geralt alone, ultimately revealing the first two tasks. After this conversation concludes, Geralt will leave the estate only to find Gaunter has been waiting for him. Gaunter reveals that while he cannot complete the tasks himself, there is no rule preventing him from helping. He then gives Geralt a few tips as well as a vial of Von Everec blood. The quest then ends and you're off to deal with the first two tasks, Open Sesame! and Dead Man's Party.","Check the notice board outside Seven Cats Inn.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_Man%27s_Party,Main_quests,"Meet Shani at her clinic, who will be talking to some Redanian soldiers about an antidote she's making. They will remark on how much she ""likes"" Geralt while she leaves for a moment to prepare the antidote. Once they leave, ask her for help to find Olgierd's brother. As it turns out, Shani has studied Famous Redanian Dynasties and even wants to join Geralt for a trip to the Von Everec family crypt, where she'll be waiting with a censer. (150)
When you reach the crypt, Shani will be there making a wreath for a wedding party, and will ask Geralt to come with her. You will be going regardless, but can say whatever you want. Once you reach the entrance, it's a bit creepy for Shani, so she stays out and Geralt will continue alone.
Waking the dead[]
Inside the big room in the crypt, Geralt will be attacked by wraiths. There will be only four and no more than two at a time, but you will face more specters later, so taking a Reliever's decoction right now is a good idea. Once you get rid of them, you can explore a bit if you want and you'll likely notice a breakable wall, but it's better to leave that for later.
Important: once you begin the ritual, you will be locked into the quest until it is completed and be forced to return if you wander too far from the relevant area/paths.
Use your Witcher Senses to inspect the coffins until you find Vlodimir's grave (it's the one with a sabre in front). When you do, you will have to use the censer that Shani gave you at all marked locations, and then light the central votive. Once done, ghosts of the entire von Everec family will awaken and attack you. After all of them are ""dead,"" Vlodimir von Everec will appear and be amused by the spectacle. After explaining Olgierd's wish to him, he will possess Geralt, causing the witcher to lose consciousness. Now Geralt, or rather Vlodimir, will be woken up by Shani and immediately starts flirting with her. Once everything is explained, Shani offers a great way for Vlodimir to have his fun - the wedding to which she invited Geralt earlier. She then leaves to prepare for the wedding and you are left with Vlodimir. (100)
Now, if you go through that breakable wall mentioned earlier, Vlodimir will have comments about the things you find inside. First you'll see a graverobber's corpse, which you can loot for a crypt key - it opens a locked door right next to the main entrance, where this tunnel will lead you to. There is some loot here, but you'll probably also notice spiderwebs and eventually a few arachnomorphs will attack, so be on your guard. While still at the crypt, Vlodimir will scold Geralt if you try to loot things outside of this tunnel. All of this is optional though and you can return for it later if you wish.
Let's Party[]
Note: For the duration of the wedding, the inventory will be disabled and you'll be equipped with master-quality Ornate robe, Ornate boots and the basic game starting equipment Hunting trousers. For a potential fight later, it's best to apply beast oil to your steel sword before starting the wedding, although it's not necessary.
You're now to meet Shani at Brunwich for the wedding, and you can't fast travel there, so call Roach when you're outside of the big gate. When you reach your destination, Vlodimir will refuse to attend a wedding dressed like Geralt currently is, and regardless of your choice will ""borrow"" some clothes hanging nearby. He also somehow manages to get a haircut and shave too.
Note: This will happen even if you came prepared and brought proper clothing and went to a barber, so don't bother trying to avoid it. You can go visit a barber after this quest to change things back (though the long beard will have to be grown out again).
A bit of talk with Shani follows and the wedding begins. (100) She will first lead you to meet the newlyweds, Aldona and Johnnus. Talk to them, and don't worry if Vlodimir offends the groom, as he does this throughout the entire quest and nothing changes. Afterwards, you'll have to take part in the activities around.
Some of the activities are mandatory while others are optional, but whenever you do something that is mandatory time will progress. When you complete two of the mandatory ones, Vlodimir will take Shani dancing during which Gaunter O'Dimm will appear and dedicate the next song to them. After the dedication, Geralt will talk a few things over with Vlodimir and propose to see why Gaunter is here, adding a new objective. When you decide to talk to him, Gaunter will introduce himself to Shani and have some ""nice"" words for Vlodimir after which he will excuse himself. (150)
Note: If you participate in all activities you will earn the Let the Good Times Roll! achievement. To make it easy, just leave a mandatory activity, like fishing out Shani's shoe, for last and take part in everything else before doing it.
Once you do all 4 mandatory quests the clock will hit midnight and ""Cinderella will have to run.""
The Pig Whisperer[]
Talk to the peasants near the pig pen and they will explain the challenge - you have to guide two pigs into the pen. This isn't made very clear, but only the black pigs with yellow paint on their backs work. You have to herd them like you would do with sheep (e.g. like Mia during Contract: Dragon) and don't use Axii, otherwise the peasants will consider this cheating and you won't get the prize. There's no time limit, so just be patient.
If you do it correctly, you will receive 200 and the King of Swineherd's crown trophy. It sounds like a mere joke, but it actually gives the highest extra gold bonus in the game, so it's a great prize. Shani will also receive a stuffed pig doll, which you will later see again at her place. If you cheated and used Axii, you'll only get 50. This is also the only mandatory activity that you can refuse to do, kind of - jumping out over the fence will give you the option to give up on it and receive no  at all, or return to try again.
Regardless of what you did here, Shani will then challenge Vlodimir to woo a nearby maiden. Choices don't matter here and just as the girl about to agree to head for the barn with you, her three brothers appear and you'll have to fight them. No matter the outcome, the girl leaves upset by what happens, while Shani mocks your flirting skills. However, winning the fight awards 200, while losing it gives 50.
What's a Celebration without Gwent?[]
Talk to the Halflings sitting at a table who are playing Gwent to join in. They use a fairly strong Northern Realms Gwent deck with the Foltest: The Steel-Forged leader, a number of spies, weather cards, and a Scorch.
If you win, you gain 200. However, if you lose you will have to give them 5% of your total coin and wear the Ass ears for the rest of the party, which you get to keep afterwards. Notably, the latter happens because Vlodimir bet ""all in"", but then the halflings take pity on him as he uses his own name and they think he's too drunk to have made a sober decision.
The Fire Swallower[]
Speak to the two people in the middle of the area who are talking about the dog who chased the Fire Swallower away. After agreeing to find them, Geralt will give Vlodimir hints where to start, so off you go.
Fortunately, Geralt's witcher senses work the same as always. You can examine the dog house and nearby items if you wish, but only the tracks are important. Shani will leave you to it once you leave to follow them. Along the way you may find a broken tree branch and the Fire swallower's cap. Then further away after the small river you'll find the fire swallower up on a tree, with Demon barking at him. You can use Axii on the dog (25) or chase it away, but note that it won't return home unless you use Axii. The fire swallower will come down then, falling because he's drunk.
You can return his hat if you found it, but eventually you'll also have the option to ask him how he does his trick. If you do that, he will then refuse to come back and you'll need to pay him 50  (5), use Axii (requires Delusion level 1 for a minimum of 25), or just let him leave.
If you convinced him to stay, you will have to escort him back to the wedding and boar attacks when you cross the river. You have to protect the fire swallower, so you'll have your weapons and previously equipped potions and bombs available. The boar prioritizes Geralt like any other enemy, so having the fire swallower die is actually hard to do, but if that happens the rest will proceed as if he just left. With the boar dead, you automatically return to the wedding and everybody enjoys the fire swallower's show. (200) If he left instead, you will have to return to the bride's parents with the bad news (50), but you'll have the option to help as an entertainer yourself and juggle some apples from a nearby table for 150.
Aldona's parents don't seem to care much about Demon though. They're either concerned by him being too calm if you used Axii, or almost relieved that they don't have to deal with him anymore if he was chased away and didn't return.
Shoe Fishing[]
Shani's Shoe Location
Talk to the people near the pond and they will explain the rules - Shani will throw in her shoe and you have to find it. Pretty easy, but there are two more lost shoes in the pond and somewhat counterintuitively, you have to get only Shani's shoe for the maximum reward of 200, otherwise you only get 50. Her shoe is located to the left in a corner on a ledge. Pick it up and bring it to her.
If you try to walk around the wedding naked, Shani will call out and force you to return and fish out her shoe.
Optional activities[]
Talk to some ""girls"" on two different occasions, where they both turn out to be elderly women
Have drinks at two of the tables
Talk to Shani inside the barn, up on the second floor through a ladder outside the small door, where you'll find a pillow to sit on (as well as the Cow gwent card if you haven't been here before and picked it up already)
Dance in front of the stage inside the barn (you only have to get there)
Party is Over[]
After you've completed the 4 main activities and have talked to Master Mirror, go near the musicians' stage where Vlodimir will want to make a speech. Shani will try to stop him, but if you don't mind looking like an ass, you can go for it without other repercussions. After this, a long cutscene starts where the garland falls on Shani's head during the traditional capping, and Vlodimir writes a letter in blood to his brother.
However, he also decides to break his promise and stay longer to pursue Shani. Fortunately, Gaunter O'Dimm reappears to banish him, albeit in a quite ominous way that even Shani feels. Geralt's mission is over and he says he should leave, but Shani walks away saddened and Gaunter gives you some advice about women before he leaves. (200)
Note: This starts the secondary quest A Midnight Clear, which has to be completed now or it will fail when you leave the wedding.
(Whether or not you complete the secondary quest, Geralt will need to requip his armor after leaving the wedding.)
All you have to do afterwards is pay a visit to Olgierd at The Alchemy inn in Oxenfurt and give him the letter from Vlodimir for 150, completing the quest.","Talk to Shani about the von Everec family crypt. (150)

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Open_Sesame!_(Hearts_of_Stone),Main_quests,"Upon reaching the Borsodi Brothers' Auction House, you'll be confronted by two guards who inform you no one is admitted without an invitation. Thankfully, Vimme Vivaldi steps in and adds you as his +1. Once inside, Vivaldi will converse until you head upstairs where, upon reaching the auction floor, he offers to introduce you to some of his fellow business associates. (100)
Note: Each of Vivaldi's associates will have a mini challenge for you with extra  for successfully completing it, and each conversation is only a one-time opportunity, so think twice before declining further interactions with them.
The Art dealer[]
If you say you know a bit about art, Yaromir will challenge your knowledge as he'll assume you know as little about art as Vivaldi, who only buys to invest rather than loving the artwork. Prove him wrong by choosing the correct painting - the Portrait of a Merchant.
For pointing out the correct piece, the dealer will give you a tip: a painting by the unpopular artist, van Rogh, is going on auction but you could earn a nice profit by selling it to an avid admirer and collector in Novigrad. Afterwards, Vivaldi will ask what Yaromir told you; if you tell him the truth you'll have to outbid him for the painting, otherwise you can lie without any consequence. (100​​)
Important: Making the correct guess and later buying the painting is the only way to unlock the secondary quest Avid Collector.
The Countess[]
Countess Mignole, an aging widow, is a collector of rare and valuable witcher gear after meeting a witcher in her youth.
Exclusive Witcher Gear

      
Don't miss this opportunity to acquire some rare witcher gear only available during this one interaction in Hearts of Stone. Purchase the diagrams for the Viper School gear from the Countess when the ""Merchant"" icon appears during the conversation.


If you're interested in learning more about the widow's past, offer to help find her earring on the balcony. (100)

The Gwent Player[]
This interaction is fairly straightforward. Robert Hilbert will ask what your preferred Gwent deck is and challenge you to a match. Your answer makes no difference, though you'll want to have a solid deck assembled if you want to stand a chance at defeating him. He plays a Nilfgaardian deck with Emhyr var Emreis: Invader of the North as his leader. Vivaldi will ask for a finder's fee on your potential winnings, but he won't take any offense if you reject him. If you beat Robert, he will give you the unique Gaunter O'Dimm card. (100)

Auction[]
The auction will start after meeting Vivaldi's acquaintances or by choosing to go sit and wait. There are three items up for auction:

""Starry Night Over the Pontar"" by the artist van Rogh - 20  (60  if you have to outbid Vivaldi)
A rare statuette of an eagle - 300  and unlocks A Dark Legacy after its dismantled
A pair of spectacles - once belonged to the hired assassin known as The Professor and you can wear them as a mask, or potentially create a Concealment kit - 350 
Achievement: buying all the items above will grant the Shopaholic achievement.
Once bidding on these items has ended, the auctioneer will announce an intermission and Vivaldi will attempt to introduce you to the establishment's proprietor, Horst Borsodi. Be as charming or as indignant as you like as there's no version of this conversation that ends well and Geralt is ""escorted"" out by the guards.
Once outside, defeat (or be defeated by) the two would-be tough guys in a fist fight to trigger a cutscene introducing The Stranger, who instructs Geralt to meet him at the Herbalist's Hut outside of town. (200)
Head there, but be aware that there is the possibility of combat along the way. If you go on foot, as you walk the road northeast towards the herbalist hut fast travel marker, a cutscene will take place and a wild boar will charge you. Defeat it and Geralt will comment about there being a crossbolt in the beast and that something must be going on nearby. A hunter's letter can also be found if the boar's tracks are followed. As you approach the hut, another cutscene may trigger where you will notice three Fallen Knights pounding on the door. The knights will turn their attention towards you as you get closer and you will have to dispose of them. After defeating the knights, a third cutscene may follow and the herbalist will let you in. Give him the password and he will open a trap door leading to the Stranger.
Note: The second cutscene seems to only trigger if you didn't skip the first by fast travelling, but you'll still have to face the fallen knights.

Planning the Heist[]
You can question the Stranger first, and even choose to return later, but you have no option except to join him. (100) He will propose a plan in which you need two more accomplices and also bribe a cook to spike the guards' food and thus reduce their numbers. This will start the following subquests, all of which must be completed before you can continue:

Open Sesame: Witcher Seasonings
Open Sesame: The Safecracker
Open Sesame: Breaking and Entering
The Heist[]
Once you've completed the 3 sub-quests, go back to the herbalist's hut cellar for a team meeting, after which you can choose to start the heist immediately or meet later by the auction house. (100) If you show up a little earlier than the actual time or just sharp, the Stranger will make a remark on this, but otherwise carries on as normal.
Important: At this point, Geralt is equipped with a non-relic version of the New Moon armor set and changing any kind of equipment is disabled until after a fight inside the vault. You can't even look at equipped armor in the inventory, but the weapons are visible and you can apply blade oils.
After Eveline successfully scales the tower, you discover it's is not empty after all. However, it's too late to back out, so respond however you like and Geralt will then arm himself with a wooden sword to prevent killing anyone before donning masks. Head downstairs to stumble across some guards and customers along with Horst Borsodi. After a fight with the guards, during which a civilian rings the alarm bell and is consequently killed by the Stranger, things end in a stalemate with guards outside the auction house and Horst Borsodi locked away in his vault.
The Stranger grabs a hostage and leaves the negotiating to Geralt, while the safecracker goes to work on the vault's doors. Depending on who you recruited for your safecracker, the next part plays out a bit differently:

If you recruited Quinto: he'll quietly work on breaking through into the vault. To buy him time you must negotiate with the guards outside and will lead to several timed responses. Choosing ""Pull back..."", ""Bring us a wagon..."", ""Doesn't matter..."" and finally ""Release one..."" will make sure you don't have to fight any guards. ""Tell me a joke"" and ""Actually, kinda funny"" works too. If you choose any other option, like asking for Radovid's carriage, the guards will burst in and you'll have to fight before continuing. Afterwards, with everything getting too dicey, Eveline explains this isn't what she signed on for and uses the chimney to escape. However, Geralt's not quite so small so you must continue on to the vault.
If you recruited Casimir Bassi: he'll go to work on breaking into the vault and, like with Quinto, you need to start negotiating and choose from several timed responses. However, even if you successfully get to asking for any wagon, an explosion will occur and you'll still have to fight the guards as if you said the wrong thing. During this, Eveline will flee and you and the Stranger must take out the guards. Afterwards, the Stranger will explain Eveline fled.
You can refuse to use hostages, but no harm will come to them either way. Regardless, you get 150​​ and it's time to make your way downstairs towards the vault where, along the way, you can find a few interesting notes. However, what happens next depends, once more, on your safecracker:

Quinto: while you didn't have to fight the guards if you successfully negotiated, and he broke into the vault, he apparently didn't find the trapdoor. Prepare yourself because as soon as you pass the small door the floor will collapse beneath you and you'll land in a pit with several arachnomorphs. Once you've dealt with them, you'll be helped back up and then you can approach the vault door safely on the other side.
Casimir: while his explosion caused you to have to fight the guards upstairs, they incidentally took out the mechanism for the floor trap, thus preventing you from falling into the arachnomorph pit so you can traverse the floor safely to the main vault door.
Interact with the door for a cutscene where the Stranger reveals himself to be Horst's brother, Ewald Borsodi. React however you like and eventually Horst tries to bribe Geralt to switch sides, upon which Geralt may choose from three options: Stick with Ewald, switch to Horst, or try and remain neutral. However, the latter option will be dismissed by Horst, as it's too late to try and remain neutral now, so you're forced to pick a side. Who sides with who depends on you and the safecracker:

Side with Ewald with Quinto as safecracker: you'll have to fight the guards, Horst, and Quinto, as he'll side with Horst.
Side with Ewald with Casimir as safecracker: you'll fight the guards and Horst, as Casimir stays with Ewald.
Side with Horst with Quinto as safecracker: you'll just have to fight Ewald as Quinto sides with Horst as well.
Side with Horst with Casimir as safecracker: you'll have to fight Ewald and Casimir.
Note that you don't actually need to kill everybody here, as a cutscene triggers when the enemy Borsodi brother is down to about a third of his health bar and the rest will automatically fall.
It is then revealed that Maximilian Borsodi's house contains the will of their father and neither brother will give it up as it means they'll lose all their fortune due to the binding clause that wasn't kept. If you still wish to take it, you'll have to fight once more, and if the safecracker survived from earlier, you'll now have to kill them and the remaining brother. However, if you don't want to fight, you can make a deal where you can take the physical object but not the documents within. Either way, you receive 100 and it's time to leave through a secret passage, which will be automatically opened by the remaining brother if you made a deal. If you killed everybody, you'll have to open the passage by finding a pressure plate on the stone pillar near the pedestal where the house was.
Note: You're only here once, so make sure you're not forgetting any loot. There are a lot of valuables, but the two big chests nearest to the house pedestal also contain Diagram: Viper venomous steel sword and a relic Ofieri crossbow.
Proceed then through the now open tunnel and as you exit through another stone wall on its other end, you'll receive 150. There may be another cutscene if Ewald is still with you, but then all that's left is to report back to Olgierd. (250​) If you've already completed Dead Man's Party, he will now give you the third task, starting the Scenes From a Marriage quest.

Journal entry[]
Olgierd's wishes were unusual, to say the least. One demand was for Geralt to bring him the house of Maximillian Borsodi. He didn't supplement this request with such key details as where this house was located or just how the witcher was to transport said real estate. Geralt only knew his first stop should be Oxenfurt, the city to which the Borsodi family had moved their world-famous auction house...
Horst Borsodi did not demonstrate a flare for hospitality. He greeted Geralt with unmasked disdain, then, upon hearing the witcher had come for Maximilian Borsodi's House, had him summarily tossed into the gutter. Geralt was still picking himself up when he discovered a stranger awaiting him there... a man who could help him fulfill Olgierd's wish.
The mysterious stranger revealed that he was planning to rob the Borsodis' Auction House. He swore Geralt would find Maximilian's House within it, as impossible as that sounded. First, however, the witcher would have to help him put together a full break-in crew of daring professionals and find a way to weaken the Redanian garrison. Though Geralt usually tried to live within the bounds of the law, this time he had no choice but to agree to help in this criminal enterprise.
Not everything went according to plan... to say the least. Geralt successfully broke into the vault, though at the cost of some nerve-wracking moments and a good deal of bloodshed. Once in the bowels of the auction house, he found out that his partner-in-crime was none other than Horst Borsodi's long-missing brother, Ewald. Cheated by his brother out of his inheritance, Ewald had planned his revenge during his long years of exile.
Geralt stands with Ewald...
Ewald had planned his revenge during long years of exile - and the witcher helped him bring this plan to fruition.
...but also demands the papers:
Yet when Geralt realized the remaining Borsodi brother was using him as well, he made sure he joined his recently murdered sibling in the afterlife. With no one left to lay a competing claim on it, Geralt took the golden casket known as Maximilian Borsodi's House and the will hidden inside it. Now he was set to fulfill Olgierd's request.
...but does not take the papers:
Ewald killed his older brother, avenging years of poverty and humiliation in one furious moment. The blood still on his hands, he gave Geralt the golden casket known as Maximillian Borsodi's House in compensation for his help, though not before taking for himself the will hidden inside it. With this is his possession, Geralt was set to fulfill Olgierd's request.
Geralt stands with Horst...
Yet now, on the cusp of his plan's completion, the White Wolf stood in his way. Geralt hadn't trusted Ewald from the very start and decided to hold his nose and support the disagreeable Horst rather than help Ewald commit fratricide.
...but also demands the papers:

With this is his possession, Geralt was set to fulfill Olgierd's request.

Notes[]
After the quest completes (not just the heist) you can find the Diagram: Concealment kit at Eveline's circus troupe camp, in a chest under the stairs to the stage.
If both Borsodi brothers die in the heist, the auction house will be acquired by Vivaldi and will become an (inaccessible) branch of his bank.
Even if you have the Skellige deck, it's not possible to tell Robert Hilbert it's your favorite.
The Stranger can actually be found inside the auction house, disguised and standing on the stair between the first and second floor.
A ""Triss wanted"" poster can be found on the board of potential recruits for the heist, but it is crossed out, indicating that the Stranger considered hiring her at one point, but decided against it or couldn't contact her.
Naturally, the balcony scene with Countess Mignole plays out differently if Vesemir is still alive. In that case, the old witcher also has an additional dialogue option when talked to.
A number of documents can be found during the heist, revealing further details about events around the heist or the larger story:
Love letter written by Olgierd to his then future wife, Iris von Everec.
Letter from Master Matthew found before entering the vault, where the person foresaw the events that were going to happen during the quest.
Request for payment on one of the tables before entering the vault, reveals that Robert Hilbert (the gwent player) was involved in installing the vault doors.
List of objects in need of restoration also on a table before entering the vault, reveals that ""van Rogh"" is actually a pseudonym used by Iris von Everec.
Bugs[]
​Purchasing all three items will earn you the Shopaholic achievement, however it can sometimes be bugged and not unlock even after purchasing the three items. In this case, it may be necessary to save before the auction begins and reloading it if it doesn't unlock.
​If you have to fight the guards after the negotiation scene, it's possible that Geralt gets stuck in one place at the start of the fight. The guards can't actually reach him, so dying isn't a possible outcome, but there's no known way to continue either. It is possible that you can wait for the Stranger to deal with them by himself, but this would take a long time and isn't tested. Only known solution is to reload the previous checkpoint or to ""bunny hop"" until you reach the vault and the cutscene, as jumping isn't locked out by the bug.
A bug in High Stakes prevents Robert Hilbert from recognizing that Geralt took part in the Gwent tournament. It can be corrected via the following console command: addfact(sq306_completed)
Trivia[]
Many items in the auction house make references. For more detailed explanations see easter eggs page:
The painting The Battle of Anghiari is clearly a tribute to the well known painter Leonardo da Vinci.
The painting The Spice Merchant is an obvious reference to artist Vermeer.
The painting Starry Night Over the Pontar is a reference to Van Gogh.
One object in a display case, the Goblet of Fire, references the Harry Potter series.
The falcon statuette is a reference to The Maltese Falcon.
An armored gauntlet with circles on the knuckles and in the center of the hand is a reference to the Infinity Gauntlet from Marvel Comics.
In the fistfight with the guards, one of the guards say ""And your mum smells like gooseberries!"", a reference to Monty Pythons' movie The Holy Grail.
In the conversation with Robert Hilbert, the phrase ""nudge nudge wink wink"" comes up, which was popularized by a Monty Python sketch.
You can find Excalibur inside the stone in the Borsodi Brothers' Auction House treasury.
The artist whose painting you need to guess for Yaromir is a lewd joke from the developers, as his name is ""Edward van der Knoob."" His last name comes from the word ""knob"" which can refer to a penis. While it can mean other things too the Polish (Original) version leaves no doubt to the meaning, as the name of the artist is changed to ""Edward van der Hooi."" Where ""Hooi"" is pronounced exactly like ""chuj"" which simply means ""dick"" in Polish. Another artist, mentioned by Vimme, is called Longendijk - another rather penile name.
The king masks are likely a reference to the U.S. president masks used by the bank robbers in the film Point Break.","Go to the Borsodi auction house in Oxenfurt and ask for the owner. (100)

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Open_Sesame:_Witcher_Seasonings,Main_quests,"As the Stranger proposed, you have to convince the garrison's cook to add a little something extra to the guards' stew for the heist night to incapacitate a fair number of them. Before anything else, you must craft a cleansing mixture which requires one Dwarven Spirit, two Rotfiend blood, and two Wolfsbane. While it's highly unlikely that you don't already have the ingredients, Otto Bamber conveniently sells all of them.
Once done, make your way to the Borsodi Brothers' Auction House and use your Witcher Senses to eavesdrop on the guards' conversations in an attempt to find out where the cook is. While doing this, you must keep the witcher senses active for the whole conversation to take place and keep your distance, so that you aren't noticed.
When the front guards don't say anything of interest, head around to the back of the building and listen to the guards there for another conversation. When, once again, this fails to turn up anything, so go to the road behind the auction house to locate a third pair of guards. These two you'll have to follow, but remember that you have to be in range while keeping distance, so try to stay just on the edge of the marked area. Eventually, their conversation gives away the location of the cook.
Make your way to the dock near the Western Gate to find the cook, Maarten, by day (at night he'll not be here). Speak to him, and either bribe him for 500 crowns (50 ) to spike his stew or simply use Axii (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35) to get him to do it for free.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Open_Sesame:_The_Safecracker,Main_quests,"You have two possible accomplices in Casimir Bassi and Quinto. Who you hire will change the enemies you face during the heist, and they further pick opposing sides at its end.
Similarly to the break-in artist choice, you can earn a little extra  if you go for one first and then recruit the other, but only minor rewards through payments and Axii. If you additionally want to have no failed objectives, it's best to start with Quinto.
Recruiting Quinto[]
Quinto is not far from the Herbalist's Hut, so it is convenient to find him straight away. You may encounter a few bandits on the way if you try to beeline for the spot, but they're entirely avoidable and not part of the quest. When you arrive at the place, he will be in the hands of Hans of Cidaris, who you might've already met during Contract: The Creature from Oxenfurt Forest and you have to convince him to free Quinto.
Note: You have to talk to Quinto in his cage. Interacting directly with Hans will only present dialogue options for the contract and not this quest.
Hans will ask you to pay 200  (20) to release Quinto. However, if you completed his contract and demanded more money at its end, he will be less than happy to see you and demand 400  (40) instead. You can haggle with him to lower the price, and it works the same like with contracts only this time you will be trying for a lower price instead of higher. You can also play Gwent or insult and then fight him, and if you win he frees Quinto for free, but if you lose in either the price is doubled, potentially further to 800  (80) with the contract completed.
Regardless how you do it, once Quinto is freed he will be at your disposal. You can recruit him right away and end the quest (150) or tell him that you don't need him yet. If you choose the latter, he'll wait for you near the Oxenfurt gate at midnight and you can go recruit Casimir instead.
Recruiting Casimir[]
Go to Alness to find Casimir on top of his house, threatening to blow himself up because his wife was cheating on him. You will have a few options to pick from:
First one will just make him kill himself
Second one leads to options to either sympathize, try to recruit him, or mock him. Sympathizing like the previous option will make him kill himself. As long as you go with either mocking or recruiting, and don't try to tell him he'll find someone else, it'll lead to a fistfight here.
Third option, to straight up mock him, will lead into a fistfight as well
Fourth option is to just use Axii (requires Delusion Level 2 for a minimum of 35)
If you got into a fight with him, he'll be hitting you with his burning torch, but you'll have potions and signs available. It doesn't matter if you win or lose as he'll agree to join you in the end, just like if you used Axii. However, regardless of how you get him to agree, you can't tell him to wait or refuse to tell him the details of the heist or he'll proceed to blow himself up. Hiring him on the spot is the only option to keep him alive (150), otherwise you'll be left with Quinto as your only choice.","Convince Casimir to take part in the robbery.
If you taunted Casimir into a fight:
Defeat Casimir.
Go to the mercenaries' camp and talk to Quinto.
If you tell Hans you'll be back:
Convince Hans to free Quinto.
If you taunt Hans into a fight:

If you postpone telling Quinto about the job:
Meet with Quinto at the Academy gate at midnight to recruit him."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scenes_From_a_Marriage,Main_quests,"It's a very good idea to get a few weapon repair kits, then head for the von Everec Estate. Once there, you'll find a scared thief looking for his partner, who's gone missing while they were trying to ""explore"" the manor. After seeing a hulking figure in the distance, the thief runs off and it's time for Geralt to start his search.
You can examine quite a few spots in the front area, but they will only lead to comments about the surprisingly well-maintained garden and Geralt will conclude that, of course, he won't just find the flower laying there. What you need to do is go to the front door, and when you interact with it a cutscene will trigger, drawing your attention to trails of a dragged body, and then some footsteps, both leading to the back area. Open the gate to it for another small cutscene, and shortly ahead you may examine the missing thief's lockpick. Regardless though, simply following the dragged body trail will lead you to the dead thief and his murderer - an eyeless monster, only known as The Caretaker.
The Caretaker[]
The horrifying looks alone should be warning enough to not underestimate him, so prepare for a tough fight. His attacks are fairly slow and predictable, but it takes time to notice the patterns. Most importantly, he heals large amounts with every hit, so you have to avoid getting hit even once if possible, although Quen can absorb a hit without him healing.
If that's not bad enough, he will also summon large groups of dark spirits, for the sole purpose of healing himself, so you have to be very aggressive and kill them before he gets the chance. Northern Wind is very effective to immobilize The Caretaker in that situation, but it might be better to target the spirits themselves with other bombs. However, don't use your best consumables right away, lest you run out of them, as it's almost inevitable that he'll heal from half health to full at least twice before you get the hang of it.
In addition to his regular swings, he has an easily dodgeable charge (it looks scary, but you can safely attack him after just a single sidestep) and two area of effect attacks, which will be noticeably outlined on the ground. They aren't interruptable and will knock you back, so move away when he starts them, but then quickly attack once his spade is in the ground - that's when he's most vulnerable. Using dodge instead of rolling prevents delays of landing hits on him. Get your Relict oil on, but forget most signs - Aard just staggers him a bit, and he's not susceptible to Yrden, Igni or Axii. Quen is the only sign that is very useful in this fight. The Quen Discharge and Exploding Shield are pretty amazing if used wisely.
When he's finally dead (200), the mysterious black cat and dog will speak to Geralt, curious as to why he's there. He asks to see Iris for the violet rose and the animals inform him that he can find the mistress inside the house, in her bedchamber. They tell you to take the key to the back door from the Caretaker's body so you can enter the house. Geralt will grab the key automatically, but before you go inside you can loot The Caretaker's spade (doesn't glow with Witcher Senses), as well as an ornamented brush under the remains of a gazebo in the southeast corner of the garden.
The Haunted House[]
Enter the house and you'll feel what awaits ahead, as Iris' voice echoes. There will be a lot of doors, but only the intended ones will be open, so don't worry about getting lost. As you make your way through it, Geralt will see a wraith that appears briefly in paintings. Iris' sketchbook can be picked up from a table in the room where she first appears. On the second floor, you'll have to go through a balcony walkway and back inside into a small bedroom, where the doors in front ominously open.
Note: Before you proceed further, this is the ideal moment to meditate and a Reliever's decoction will be your best choice ahead.
As you enter the hallway, all the lights go out briefly before The Wraith from the Painting appears and attacks. Like any wraith, she is susceptible to Yrden and Specter oil. However, she has one tactic that can drag out the fight. She'll float up, making it impossible to hit her, then let out a type of scream that emits as green and a random painting in the room will then echo this color. Quickly hit the green painting to close it as it will start to heal her as she draws near it, and once she's close enough, she'll enter the painting and re-emerge from another painting at full health. It can be particularly frustrating when Geralt auto-targets the wraith instead of the painting, so try to be as close to the wall as possible.
When she is defeated (200), enter the bedchamber right ahead to find Iris' long dead body on the bed. Examining her body will trigger a cutscene and you'll be moved downstairs after, so before doing that you can pick up a Portrait of Iris and Olgierd from a nearby table, as well get any loot. After another brief conversation with the strange animals, Geralt has to properly bury Iris' remains before he can summon her ghost. (100)
The cat and dog now give you the front door key too, so you can exit easily and look for a good spot for a grave. The only one that works is by the easel near a tree in the farthest corner to the left. You can say a few words, as well as choose one of the ornamental brush, the sketchbook, or the painting to put on Iris' grave. Only one item can be placed on and the others will become worthless junk after the quest is over. There will be a comment later by Iris about the choice you made but any of the items will work.
When the funeral is complete, Geralt summons Iris' spirit, who creates a magic painting of the manor and enters it, then Geralt follows her.
The Painted World[]
Geralt finds himself in the surreal painted world reminiscent of the estate. The dog and cat, who apparently exist simultaneously in both worlds, informing him that in order to truly awaken Iris, Geralt has to complete the memories she has been denying, and destroy the fears and nightmares that bind her.
Note: Inside the painted world, you can't ""truly"" meditate, but merely accessing the meditation panel will apply all of the practical effects, such as health regeneration and replenishing potions and bombs.
To awaken Iris, there are a total of seven memories that must be unlocked by solving a puzzle of missing elements in a frozen scene, though there's an eighth one that, while not needed, helps give more insight and is needed to unlock the Curator of Nightmares achievement. Most of them require finding and placing items in particular spots, but not all items found will be useful.
As you reenact the memories, Geralt will see how the couple's marriage began to deteriorate over time, how Iris' family didn't approve of Olgierd as her husband, and how Olgierd tried to use magic to summon Gaunter O'Dimm to try and break the pact he forged, but it ultimately failed and set fire to the manor. Eventually, it leads to a scene where, having grown indifferent to Iris and only remembering that he was supposed to love her, Olgierd gave her the strange cat and dog for company and the Caretaker for protection.
After all of these, there will be an additional final memory, but the puzzles are the following:
Courtyard gazebo (optional)[]
To compete this, find and place the painter's palette on the table, and the book in Olgier's hand. The teapot is useless. However, beware of hostile swarms attacking Geralt just after you complete this. (100) They are similar to the black clouds during A Towerful of Mice and can be burned down with Igni. A few more can be encountered on the way to the next memory.
The fountain[]
As you approach, you will be attacked by arachnomorph specters and there will be more of them to the left, but those are best ignored as they will respawn right after the memory is restored, and none of them yield . To restore the memory, you only have to find a wooden cup and place it in Iris' hand, even though there's also a wedding veil and two bouquets of flowers nearby. When the cutscene ends (100), a giant arachnomorph specter will attack together with a few of the smaller ones. Then a few more will be immediately around, and optionally two on each side of the house entrance.
The dinner table[]
There are no items to pick up here, although a couple can be examined. Instead, the painting will show flames that are supposed to be lit in the memory but currently aren't. Light the fireplace and the two candlesticks closest to it and the diners, only the one furthest away should be unlit. (100) After this memory, a weak specter of Olgierd will attack you on the way to the next one.
The bedroom[]
You can examine the washing bowl, to which Geralt will comment that there's blood, hinting that the bloody towel is the correct thing to place next to Olgierd. (100) The night lamp and night gown serve no purpose.
The painting studio[]
Here you need to observe Iris' painting, then pick up the goblet and fruit bowl, and interact with the table. These are only two objects, but you'll be taking two kinds of fruit out of the bowl to arrange a total of three items on the table. The correct placement is grapes on the left, goblet in the middle, and apples on the right. (100)
Olgierd's study[]
Easily the most challenging of the eight memories. On the way here, in a hallway similar to the one where you fought The Wraith from the Painting, five of Olgierd's specters will attack you. They are stronger than the previous lone one, not overwhelmingly so, but be on your guard.
As you enter the study, you'll immediately notice the encircled pentagram here, but first you need to pick up items. There are two books around, one of which (Between Worlds) is only an extra read, but the other, Blood Pacts, or On Foreign Presences, describes the ritual that you have to recreate in the memory. That is, find the piece of chalk with which to redraw the circle, then put beeswax candles on its border and not anywhere inside (these two items can be hard to spot).
During this memory a fire ensues and you have to escape. To do that, interact with the winter painting on the wall. (200) As you are in a painted world, after entering the winter painting you find yourself in a blizzard and have to run for cover. Your escape are the cellar doors to the right of the main stairs - very hard to miss, an Olgierd specter will even be standing above it.
The cellar[]
Two out of four objects are necessary here. The Marriage contract quite obviously goes into Iris' father's hands, while the mug goes into Olgierd's. If you find the pipe, Geralt will make a comment about it, but it's only a decoy and the knife does nothing at all. As the father is killed in this memory, three ghoul specters will attack once it completes. (100)
The dining room[]
For this final puzzle, the cat and dog will take their places to give you a hint. Find and place the large bowl beside the dog, the small bowl beside the cat, and the food tray in the Caretaker's hands. (100)
Ethereal[]
Prepare for a fight, as in the next room you will find the final memory in a letter by Olgierd left for Iris, stating that he was leaving her with only a letter and a rose to remember him by, as he didn't want to hurt her further. As you read the letter, Iris' greatest fear in the ethereal form of her husband, appears and attacks Geralt.
When the battle begins, there are six ethereals that surround you, but only one is active and the rest will remain dormant unless attacked. Once you defeat the active ethereal, one of the dormant ones will awaken and attack, each stronger than the previous. Try to avoid hitting the inactive ones or you will quickly get swarmed and easily die even with Severance-enhanced Whirl. At the start of the battle, you can go to the far end of the room and wait for the ethereals to approach individually — this helps to avoid activating more than one at once.
The final two ethereals are almost pound for pound match for the real life version of Olgierd, so you know what to expect if you fought him during Evil's Soft First Touches. You will need to use the dodge-hit-dodge-hit fighting style and extensive use of Quen (preferably with the Active Shield upgrade) to win. Regular strikes can be parried but not the charging strike. The powered up strikes can be parried, but it is very challenging timing to do so. If you manage it, you can get in up to three strong attacks. Counter-attack is the most effective way to beat the ethereals, as their attacks can be sidestepped, allowing Geralt to hit from the flanks.
Note: If you're up for a challenge, defeating all six ethereals simultaneously awards the When It's Many Against One... achievement, but obviously the above-described tactics are for one-on-one combat. To fight them all together, note that they can be continuously stunned by the fire from a Dancing Star bomb, and you want them all bunched up together for maximum hits with whirl.
Iris[]

After defeating the ethereals (300), Geralt finally meets Iris, who holds the violet rose. While the original violet rose had withered in the real world, the rose in the painted world still exists. Geralt needs the rose, but also explains that Iris' bond with it is such that, should it be taken, she may cease to exist. You now have a choice:
Leave the rose[]
If Geralt decides to let Iris keep the rose, the dog and cat will be resigned to their fate to watch over her, hoping another in the future will free them. Iris will go back into her slumber, and Geralt leaves through the portal back into the real world. It is there where he finds a Painting of Iris holding a violet rose, which he will take to Olgierd.
Take the rose[]
If Geralt decides to take the rose, Iris gives it up willingly. The dog and cat are now freed from their service and, in gratitude, they give Geralt some advice. They warn him to beware of O'Dimm and, should he stand in his way, the witcher should ""seek salvation in glass that can't be broken."" Iris gives Geralt the rose and the entire painted world begins to crumble, as Geralt leaves the world before it completely vanishes.
Whatever your choice was, the quest completes and you receive 500. As you end still inside the estate, note that none of the gates to the outside will open and you have to leave through the broken wall section where you met the thief, just to the right (east) of the main (north) gate.","Note: The order in which these objectives appear may differ depending on the order on what's interacted with first.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Whatsoever_a_Man_Soweth...,Main_quests,"Go to meet Olgierd's man at the Alchemy Inn, only to find Gaunter O'Dimm waiting for Geralt. Before you can approach him, a drunk intervenes and tries to talk to Geralt, at which point O'Dimm stops time so you can speak without interruptions. O'Dimm then tells Geralt that in order to fulfill the remainder of their contract, Geralt has to bring Olgierd to meet with him at the Temple of Lilvani. O'Dimm then leaves, but not before killing the drunk for interrupting their meeting. Once time resumes, Geralt speaks to Olgierd's man and tells him to inform Olgierd to meet at the temple. The man then informs Geralt that Shani wants to see him.
Final Goodbyes[]
If you choose to see Shani, you'll find her preparing to leave for the front lines to help as a medic for the soldiers. Geralt asks her if she found anything about Olgierd and she explains that she found someone who might know more about him, a Professor Premethine Shakeslock.
Follow Shani to the Oxenfurt Academy, where she'll convince the guards to allow her in, and she will help Geralt get inside another way before she leaves. Geralt somehow knows exactly where to go for this, but to save some time running around to the target objective, you can jump off the middle of the bridge to safely dive into the river. When you reach the place, kill the drowned dead and approach the wall, where Shani will drop you a rope to climb in.
When the cutscene ends, Shani will leave and you have to take care of some witch hunters. When done with them, you'll find the professor's residence locked up, so you have to find another way in. Climb some ladders and scaffoldings and jump onto to the small balcony at their end, where you'll have to Aard away a door. Unfortunately, the blast will also damage the structural beams of the house, which will have consequences later. You'll meet the professor downstairs, but you can examine some things on the way if you wish - nothing important, though there is a unique book on the second floor.
When you reach Shakeslock, it turns out that he's blind and, perhaps paranoid, refuses to leave a protective circle too. At first he thinks that Geralt was sent by O'Dimm, but will relax once the witcher explains what's going on. While you talk to him, he'll basically recap the main story so far, but it also turns out that Olgierd had to make a choice between losing Iris or Vlodimir, leading to his brother's death.

Shakeslock then tells Geralt that to defeat O'Dimm one must challenge him to a game of wits by putting up for grabs the only thing O'Dimm cares about having: one's soul. As the professor finishes explaining this, the wooden support beam above snaps and a bookcase begins to topple over. Geralt rushes in and keeps the bookcase from falling, but as Shakeslock steps back, he slips on a bottle, pushing him out of the protective circle, and immediately breaks his neck.
You can loot him for his journal and the key to the front door so you can exit. Outside, climb the wall tower from which you can jump into the river to leave. However, note that this is your only visit to the academy grounds, so now's the time to loot anything if you want.
Before you proceed to the next part, this is your last chance to meet Shani again for one last goodbye and you'll part as friends.
In the Temple of Lilvani[]
To reach the temple, you'll have to go through some caves east of Toderas, where you might've already been for Contract: Phantom of the Trade Route. If you have, there's a path to continue down instead of up where the draconoid nests were - that's where you need to go.
When you arrive, a cutscene starts and Geralt will give Olgierd the violet rose or a painting with it, fulfilling the third wish. Gaunter O'Dimm appear then, informing Olgierd that he has fulfilled their contract. As Olgierd starts to rebut this, saying the final part of the contract required them to meet on the moon, O'Dimm makes the dirt beneath them blow away, revealing a mosaic floor of the moon. If Geralt did not meet Shakeslock, O'Dimm claims Olgierd's soul and you can do nothing but watch. However, if you did meet the professor, you can challenge O'Dimm to a game of wits, where if Geralt loses, O'Dimm could then claim both Olgierd's and Geralt's souls, but if Geralt wins, they both go free.
Contract Fulfilled[]
If Master Mirror takes Olgierd's soul, the latter dies and O'Dimm offers you a reward:
To be as swift as the wind. (Caparison of Lament)
Never wanna go hungry again. (Horn of Plenty)
A bottle of vodka that's always full. (Bottomless carafe)
Make me rich. (5,000  prior to Patch 4.0, 10,000  with it)
Don't want anything from you. (refuses any rewards)
Geralt can ask him to find Ciri, though O'Dimm will say it is beyond even his power. He will, however, give advice on getting a more pleasant ending with Ciri but this is only available before The Isle of Mists quest, or when you do a standalone expansion playthrough.
O'Dimm's challenge[]
If challenged to play for both souls, Gaunter puts you in a twisted world and explain the rules of the challenge. After the cutscene in which O'Dimm recites the riddle which he wants Geralt to solve, players will resume control and the clock starts ticking once Geralt passes through the temple threshold.
The bar representing Geralt's remaining time to complete the challenge will deplete over time (initially at a very slow but perceptible rate), and more when Geralt investigates various points of interest in the miniature world. Most of the points of interest in the world are decoys designed to waste time and increase O'Dimm's enjoyment of Geralt's predicament. O'Dimm has also deployed specters in this world resembling blackened versions of monsters Geralt has fought before. These monsters can be ignored but they give XP when killed and shouldn't be difficult to defeat provided Geralt's level is comparable to the quest recommendation. Monsters will adopt the Foglet, Hym, and Gargoyle templates.
map of Gaunter's world
If you're having trouble on how to solve the riddle, follow these steps:
Head down the path away from the temple.
When the path forks, ignore the ruins on the left-hand side and follow the fork on the right.
Kill or run past the Foglet specters, continue over the bridge.
When the path splits again, take the left (it may look like 3 paths with another fork on the far left, but ignore that one)
Continue straight along the path and go under the bridge, then take the left path. When the path splits, go right and you'll see a red glowing point of interest. Defeat the Hym specter around here. If you want the Viper venomous silver sword (or the legendary version on a New Game +) head up the stairs and take it out of the stone.
Facing away from the stone, head left and follow until the split, then go left, towards the house on the hill.
Defeat the two gargoyle specters in front of the house or run past them. O'Dimm will claim you're doing terribly, but ignore him and head into the house. There should be time to loot the items in the entrance hall.
Make sure you have at least half your health, then go down the stairs, and head towards the mirror. (Quen will not help here)
O'Dimm will taunt Geralt as time grows short. Rather than run around trying to find a mirror which won't be smashed by O'Dimm, look for the dry fountain in the courtyard (to the left, just behind another mirror that'll break). Geralt will give a similar hint to players if they've run around and smashed too many mirrors in this area.
In the fountain, examine the dry steps near the cracked wall and use Aard on the wall to break it, starting a cutscene.
After successfully completing the challenge, you'll have a chat with Olgierd and he gives you his sword Iris for freeing him.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Midnight_Clear,Secondary_quests,"After Vlodimir is sent back to the realm of the dead, you can now choose whether to stay and talk with Shani or leave the wedding. If you wish to romance her, you can do so without it affecting any relationship you may have going on with Yennefer or Triss.
If you wish to stay, read Shani's journal entry to learn she loves rowan blossoms. However, any of the 4 choices can get a romantic ending to the night if the right dialogue is chosen with just minor differences. Your 4 choices are:
Rowan branch (located up the stairs on a green bush near the barn's ladder) (150 )
Chamomile (located near the pigs' pen)
Rowanberry brandy (located on table near the Rowan tree)
Mead (located near starting point on table)
Make your choice and go give Shani the present. If you give the rowan branch, she'll put it in her hair.
If you tell Shani she's got Geralt, she'll remark how she wants someone who she knows will be waiting for her at home every night, thus making Geralt unsuitable long term, though you can at least enjoy yourselves for one night.
Picking the second dialogue option here leads to the two toasting to their friendship. As the two go for a walk, there'll be several dialogue options, with some timed, to respond to her.
If you wish to romance her, at one point you can choose to kiss her near the large tree. Shani will then ask if you want to continue walking or head back.
To continue romancing her, walk with her and eventually the two will find a boat and sail out into the middle of the lake and proceed to have sex. If you gave Shani alcohol as a present, right during the climax she'll suddenly throw up over the side of the boat and Geralt will make a funny remark on this.
Otherwise, the night ends more romantically if given one of the plants. Time will then pass to morning where the two talk a bit more and Shani leaves, finishing the quest.

Impressed, Yaromir will pull you to the side and as a way to apologize gives you some useful information: a van Rogh painting, ""Starry Night Over the Pontar"", is going on the block and while a largely unknown artist, Marcus T.K.

While 3 locations are marked, only one has enough jade and naturally is the only location with enemies, Bloodrot Pit (the middle location). Inside, you'll likely have to fight off several groups of arachnomorphs before you can then examine the the center of the first area of the cave, near the base of the pillar, to find and mine the jade.
Note: Just inside the cave entrance, you can also start The Drakenborg Redemption by looting a corpse.
Once extracted, head back to talk to the runewright and you'll see he's set up a basic workstation and thanks you for the jade, completing the quest (100). He can then make level 1 enchantments, and is also available as an amateur craftsman for any kind of gear.
Note that, while the quest completes without further payments, to unlock all 3 craft levels you'll need to pay him substantially more:
10,000  unlocking level 2 enchantments and journeyman craftsman
15,000  unlocking the final level 3 enchantments and master craftsman
These payments also earn 100 each, thus actually tripling the standard reward for the quest. Note: these are quest rewards, not the regular  earned per 10  paid, and are subject to the XP character/quest level and difficulty constraints.","Find a pickaxe.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Rose_on_a_Red_Field,Secondary_quests,"The quest begins during the first main quest Evil's Soft First Touches, after Geralt is given his task from Olgierd he will be stopped by Adela while leaving, who will give him this quest.
Go to Bowdon, use your Witcher Senses and Geralt should soon remark on sensing the smell of chemicals, but the village is overrun by ghouls, so you'll have to exterminate them first. When safe, follow the scent to a house where Geralt will find evidence of Fisstech production, a warning letter and a trail of footprints. Following the trail you will eventually find Kluivert's body, and now you will need to find who shot him so look behind the fence to find other footprints and follow those. These footprints will lead to a set of horseshoe prints in the center of Bowdon. The horseshoeprints lead out of town, and around a marsh where drowned dead may pop up out, but you can just run past them if you don't want to fight.
Eventually you will reach a bandit camp full of Fallen Knights (which you may have visited before for From Ofier's Distant Shores). On the wagon nearby, you will find a letter. Read the letter to locate the hiding place.
Head to the hiding place and there will be two knights outside. Approach them and a cutscene will start allowing Geralt to talk or fight right away. If you decide to talk, you are given three choices:
Fight them
Pay them 1,000  (100)
Cast Axii (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35) and make them count to 100 before they turn hostile
If you dealt with them peacefully you can still attack them and loot your coin back if you chose to bribe them. If you fight them at any point, they'll also drop the key for the nearby door, though it's useless if they already agreed to let you in.
However you dealt with them, head inside but prepare for combat. In the back of the cave, you will meet Ulrich who, even if you try to leave, will recognize Geralt as Jacques de Aldersberg's killer and order the knights to kill him.
Tip: If you are having troubles fighting the knights you can use Golden Oriole and lead them into the field with poisonous fumes, which will poison them. You can also ignite them with Igni, however, that may also hurt Geralt, unless you use Quen to take the hit.
After everyone is dead, go to The Alchemy in Oxenfurt to collect your reward. You can choose to tell Adela what happened and who killed Kluivert, or just ask for your reward and it makes no difference. (150)","Investigate Bowdon for clues about Kluivert's murder using your Witcher Senses .

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Taxman_Cometh,Secondary_quests,"As you pass through Oxenfurt's markets, Walthemor Mitty will stop Geralt to question him about his sudden income discrepancy, which has no doubt raised suspicions. You'll then be asked three questions:
Question #1 - Have you ever engaged in the wholesale trade of rawhide in the White Orchard area?
This is in reference to the exploit where you would kill the cows in White Orchard to sell their hides and milk for great profit. You can answer either yes or no.
Question #2 - Have you ever engaged in the acquisition of bivalves with the express intention of selling the pearls therein?
This is in reference to a quick turnaround where you would buy sea shells, dismantle them for pearls, and sell them for a high profit. You can answer either yes or no.
Question #3 - Have you ever waltzed into someone's home and taken something without their permission?
You can answer either yes or no.
If you answered no to two or more of the exploit questions, he will hand you a diploma and bestow on you the title of ""Taxpayer in Good Standing"". Suggesting you frame it, hang it in a place of honor.
If you answered yes to two or more of the exploit questions, he will hand you a summons to pay back your taxes. You will then have to report to the Vivaldi Bank in Novigrad with the document and pay 1000  (100).

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Without_a_Trace,Secondary_quests,"To start this, you must pick up the contract off of Brunwich's notice board, then make your way to Otto Bamber, the herbalist at the Herbalist's Hut just outside Oxenfurt. Talk with him and he'll tell you his apprentice, Folkert, has gone missing near Deadwight Wood and hasn't come back. There's no way to haggle here, so just accept the quest to continue.
With that, head out to the marker and use your Witcher Senses to inspect the wagon just off the road, then the blood trail nearby, going north. The foliage here may make it hard to track the blood trail, but you should be able to make out it's going north until it stops just outside Erde village.
The village, however, is rather empty: you can inspect the hut to the right of the gate for months' old blood stains, but other than that there's nothing else to do but talk to the elderly couple. You can mention the blood stains, but they'll wave it off as that's where they prepare their meat, as it's abandoned and it's much nicer than being outdoors. Regardless, when asked about Folkert they'll say he was attacked by wolves but they told him to go back home as they didn't want trouble and he must have been killed in the woods by the pack as he was intent on picking herbs.
You can now either return to the herbalist with your news (for 200  and 50 ) or head towards the eastern gate (right next to the couple's hut) for Geralt to pick up the smell of rotting meat. If you want to investigate this, follow the smell with your Witcher Senses to a hidden cellar door, blast away the debris, and enter to find a chopped up body. Examining it will determine that it's Folkert, but his cause of death is impossible to determine.
Return to the couple to confront them about this and they'll say that he'd been killed by the wolves and they merely collected his body (and others) to eat, as they're too weak to farm but must find food somehow. However, there's no way to determine what's the truth or not in this situation so you have two choices now:
let them live (making them swear they won't eat people again)
kill them
If killed, you can loot strange meat off the wife and the hut's key off the husband to enter their hut for minor loot (the interior door doesn't unlock). If you let them live, you can still get those later depending on another choice.
Whatever you chose, return to Otto to inform him what happened. If you didn't find Folkert's body, you'll receive 50 and 200 . However, if you did fully investigate you'll have the option to lie to him and unless you already killed the cannibals, this will decide their fate. The quest will end here and you'll receive 100 and 200 , but if you tell him the truth, he'll swear revenge on the peasants.
While the quest is over, upon returning to Erde later, a few different things can happen depending on your choices:
If you didn't find Folkert's body, everything will be the same
If you killed the couple, you'll see alghouls and Geralt will remark on this being a fitting situation
If you spared the couple and lied to Otto, you'll see the husband grieving for his wife who died of hunger
If you spared the couple and told the truth, you'll find the cannibals dead with alghouls around them and Geralt will comment that Otto wasn't making idle threats. In this case, you can loot the corpses for the key to the hut and the strange meat.","Talk to the herbalist.

These are spread throughout the world, but the easiest one to find is during the side quest Rose on a Red Field. When you come across the first group of soldiers quickly take care of them and inspect the cabin. Open the chest on the right side to find the trousers diagram.
If you haven't already talked to Dulla, go talk to him now and ask about the diagram and he'll explain they'd been stolen. He'll then give you information on where he was attacked, so head out to this marker to investigate.
At the site, you will find a set of footprints. Follow them slightly up a nearby hill, until the trail goes cold. Walk a bit up the hill with your Witcher Senses and it won't take long to find a pool of blood. Now follow that trail to a corpse further up the hill. When you investigate the corpse, the trail goes cold again. Walk past the corpse on the left to pick up the footprint trail again. Not too far ahead is a hidden door beneath some hay.
Open the door and climb down into the secret lair. Slay the Fallen Knight that hide out down below. If you are having trouble with the shield carrying knights, use Axii to stun them so you can land a blow or two.

Note: If you manage to shoot Golyat in the eye with your crossbow it will result in an instant death and you will receive the David and Golyat achievement. However, even if you already have it you can still use this method to kill him unless regular combat is easier to you.
Regardless, after Golyat is dead you will have a short conversation on how to proceed. (450)
Note: Golyat leaves a second corpse containing over 100  (and up to 400 have been observed), but it might not appear until later revisiting the area.
Investigating[]
Follow Milton to the shoreline below The Cockatrice Inn and once there use your Witcher Senses to investigate. The trails there will lead you into the water, but before diving in you will have to dispose a group of scurvers - a more dangerous variation of rotfiends, for which you'll want to have Quen up to survive their far-reaching death explosions (especially dangerous if Deadly Precision is triggered against them). While searching underwater, you will find a Handkerchief monogrammed ""d.l.C."", now talk to Milton and you will go to the Inn to get more details. After getting all your answers it's time to go to Corvo Bianco.
Note: In the barn next to inn you can find an old pamphlet.
The place isn't far so you can go on foot. When you get close you will hear the sounds of battle and, if you investigate the area thoroughly, Geralt will deduct the culprit is a bruxa and you will have the optional objective to check the bestiary for more info (doing that gives 150). Now enter the cellar and find the vampire, once you do Geralt will try to converse with her, however she won't listen and you will have to fight her. She can turn invisible, but if you have Superior Moon Dust and throw one at her it will make the ability useless. It is also possible to deliver a one-hit death by knocking her with Aard slowed down by Yrden (otherwise she's too fast). After she is dead (500) examine the last victim's body to find a coin pouch in its mouth and the Unusual severed hand which attracted the bruxa. (150) Then go see Palmerin at the arena.
The arena[]
Note: When you reach the arena you may overhear a Knight named Bors conversing with Percival to start the There Can Be Only One quest. You'll also find a notice for that later though.
Talk to Palmerin and after some small talk he will take Geralt to the stands. Guillaume will be fighting a handicapped shaelmaar, however it will soon lose its handicap and Geralt will have to step in to help. Palmerin will help too, but he can get beat up by the shaelmaar (he won't die, so don't worry about him). The shaelmaar can be a tough opponent, however as Geralt will point out it's blind thus it uses sound to know where to attack. To make the fight easy use Aard while standing near a wall then dodge away, thus baiting the monster to crash into it and tip over making it vulnerable to attacks. After you defeat it (300) Anna Henrietta will prompt you to finish it, but you can refuse.
Important: If you spare the shaelmaar it will count as ""Proof of compassion"" for There Can Be Only One.
During the following conversation, Anna Henrietta will take Geralt to meet Damien de la Tour and give him the deed and key to Corvo Bianco as part of his contract reward (100), starting the secondary quest No Place Like Home. When Geralt points it out as the morgue where he fought the bruxa, the conversation turns more serious and it's time to ask Damien for details about the victims. After learning everything Geralt will deduce that the next victim will be Milton de Peyrac-Peyran. Anna Henrietta will reveal that Milton and the other victims were once a team and agree with Geralt. However, Milton is already taking part in the annual hare hunt game and won't be easy to find. After the cutscene, you'll be on Roach following Annarietta to Beauclair Palace.
Hare hunt[]
Anna Henrietta will decide that breaking the rules of the game is necessary to save Milton. To find him, a riddle must be solved using a Clue from the horn of a ""unicorn"", Key from the Golden Fish, and the Phoenix egg. She will instruct you to find the fish and horn, while she nabs the egg. You're supposed to split up here, but following her will lead you right next to the ""unicorn""'s location.
Apart from finding the key and making your way to the Milton's hiding spot, the rest of the objectives of this part of the quest are actually optional. While the intended way of progressing is retrieving the key and the clue from the horn of a unicorn and then meeting up with Anna Henrietta to solve a riddle, if the player already knows where Milton is hiding, they can go directly there after retrieving the key. However, in doing so you would miss extra  rewards.
The correct fish
To find the fish, you need to dive into the water. There are multiple under the water, but only one of them – a golden one – holds the key while the rest contain sweets. If you find the right fish the first or the second time, you get the key instantly. (150) If you pick the wrong fish twice in a row, someone else catches the fish from under Geralt's nose, leading to a cutscene of Geralt unceremoniously nabbing the fish from them and breaking it to get the key. (50) If you wish to find the correct fish on your own, then it's best not to use witcher senses to locate it, as the glowing outlines make it harder to differentiate the fish by color. It is the on the southwestern end of the search area, closest one to the shore.
To get the horn you need to reach the ""Unicorn"". The animal, however, will run away when approached and you need to either gain its trust with treats or use Axii to calm it. If you go for the treats, several can be found around the picnic blankets just south of the circular stone veranda where Anna Henrietta gets the Phoenix Egg. The ""Unicorn"" doesn't like cookies, though you can just find another treat when that fails. Regardless of how you got to it, you get 150, but using Axii will cause some other partygoers to accuse Geralt of cheating and try to fight him. However, you can Axii them as well (40 and doesn't require Delusion), or have a fistfight with the men.
Note: While not related to the riddle, there are two optional interactions that are only available until the quest ends and your last chance to do them is now, before returning to the Duchess with the clues (or finding Milton with just the key). See Lost ring and Grain cup for details.
Once you have both clues go back to Anna Henrietta who will just be taking the egg and now you have to solve the riddle. The correct answer is ""Greenhouse"" and you get 200 for guessing it. If you get it wrong, Anna Henrietta will guess the correct answer instead.
Regardless, the quest will end here (1,000) and instantly continue to the next main quest, Blood Run.
Important: If you guess the correct answer it will count as ""Proof of wisdom"" for There Can Be Only One.","Defeat the giant. (450)

After Geralt chases the Beast to an empty warehouse, a short conversation starts between the two, and the fight begins.
Note: You can lose the fight, however you won't earn any experience then.
The Beast is a tough opponent: he will teleport around and try to stab Geralt in the back, and he can also block and dodge attacks himself. Try to dodge attacks after he teleports and then counterattack. Quen with Active Shield works well during the fight as, while this is a fast-paced fight, the attacks of the Beast aren't very strong thus the shield will not break with just one hit. The fight will end before either of you reach zero HP so you have to be careful not to get too low on health and you cannot rely on Undying.

Regis will assert that Dettlaff would not be doing what he is doing if he didn't have a good reason. Soon Knights appear, and Regis has to run away, but not before telling Geralt where they can meet. After a short conversation with the Knights, the quest ends.",Fight the Beast.
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/La_Cage_au_Fou,Main_quests,"Head to Mère-Lachaiselongue Cemetery and try the only door to the crypt, but Regis isn't answering so you must find another way in. There will be an archespore and a ghoul around if you haven't cleared them previously. Nearby is an open tomb so drop down and kill the kikimores here. Note that if you destroy all the eggs here using Igni, you get 100 but then a kikimore warrior will appear that you must also kill.
Head further in where you can go left or right. The supposedly dead end on the left though is actually an illusion: using The Eye of Nehaleni on it will reveal a sarcophagus, on which you can find the Casus Foederis sword and a note. Turn around and you can enter the crypt from immediately to your left, or backtrack to the other path, where Aard can be used to remove some debris before entering from there. However you got in, a cutscene will follow. (450)
After reintroductions, Geralt shows the severed hand to Regis, who comes up with a plan to brew a Resonance potion, which would aid your mission to find Dettlaff. However, the potion requires a rare type of ingredient, which Geralt names three options for, and Regis will send some helper ravens to search for them. While waiting, you can choose to talk or not, with as many options as you wish until you've exhausted them all. Eventually Regis gets word that a spotted wight is actually in the area, despite Geralt saying that specific subspecies of wights were extinct. Read the bestiary entry for 100 if you wish and it's time to go find it.
Trastamara Estate Ruins[]
Head out to the Trastamara Estate Ruins, all the way west of the cemetery. Note: chances are, the path will take you right by Doren Alma Estate, where the secondary quest Extreme Cosplay will trigger, if not done already. This quest can be difficult at low levels, so consider taking another route to not trigger this yet if you want to do it later, as it must be taken care of immediately or will disappear once passed by.
There are spoons everywhere at the ruins, and several barghests to deal with on the way to the main house. Once you approach the doorway, a small cutscene starts where Geralt reads the curse that's scratched all over the walls. Enter the place and search it thoroughly if you wish to lift the curse. While not necessary, there are also multiple documents related to the curse, starting with a soiled letter on a bench outside the house (to the left when facing the entrance), a stained diary in the oven left of the entrance, a decaying letter near the table with the skeletons, and a book in the cellar (to the left, before dropping into the spoon-covered area).
There are examinable spoons everywhere inside, but only one is worth noting: a spoon key (starts the Spoontaneous Profits! treasure hunt) in a corner at the room to the far right, where Geralt will start reading more curse writings from the walls. There's also an easily missable vial containing a greater green mutagen, in the room with the cauldron. Once you examine the cauldron, Geralt will decide to hide and you can go in the nearby cupboard.
Important: If you want to lift the curse, you need to have examined enough objects around the house before hiding. It doesn't matter which ones, but some will have more ""weight"" than others. The shortest way to achieve this seems to be examining just the two tables, but either way you will get 300 when enough is done.
Hiding in the cupboard triggers a cutscene and, if Geralt has learned enough to lift the curse, you will have a timed choice:
Attack the monster
Try to lift the curse
Either one will get you the ingredient you need, but lifting the curse will give you access to a secondary quest, The Hunger Game, as well as potentially more .
Attack the monster[]
This is also the default if Geralt doesn't know how to lift the curse. The ""Spoon Collector"" will run into the cellar with the spoon-covered floor and Geralt must kill it (650), then loot the body for a wight saliva gland. (1,000) It will also have the Wight trophy and a key opening the nearby locked tunnel.
Try to lift the curse[]
Geralt will first get some wight brew (1,000) and then you're given 3 choices, but only the option to eat without spoons is correct. If you choose any other option, it'll fail to lift and the wight runs off. You don't need to chase and kill it as you already got the wight brew. If you do chase after it, it'll have run into the room with all the spoons like if you straight out attacked it instead. If you do kill it here, you will get 650 and all loot items that you would've gotten by outright attacking it.
If the curse is lifted, it still runs away, but in this case it leaves a stench trail leading outside, which again is optional to follow. If you choose to follow, you may have to deal with a couple of barghests before finding out that the wight was a cursed woman, Marlene. A small cutscene then happens where Geralt takes her to Corvo Bianco for her to recover. If you've yet to visit your home, the initial conversation with Barnabas-Basil Foulty is a bit different, but either way at the end of the conversation you will receive 1,000 for finding Marlene. 48 hours later, The Hunger Game will automatically start (it doesn't matter if you tell BB her story or not).
Tesham Mutna[]
Head back to the cemetery and talk to Regis, who needs one last ingredient and Geralt must help him get it at Tesham Mutna Ruins. You can choose to go immediately or prepare first, but you're actually allowed to just leave him there once you head out. Either way, when the conversation or cutscene ends you will receive 400. When you decide to go, Regis will put himself in a state to ensure you'll get the last ingredient and you'll be at Tesham Mutna, where he reveals a secret entrance and you can examine a body by the door, but much more interesting things await inside.
Note: You will only be here this one time, so anything you miss will be gone forever.
Head in where you can find a few interesting things in the first room, but most notably 3 pieces of the Tesham Mutna armor set in the chest Regis initially leans against: the sword, armor, and trousers. Follow Regis down the stairs to another room where you can examine the signs on the walls and pickup a few more interesting objects. In the chest next to Regis are 2 more pieces of armor: the mask and boots. In the next section is the third tribe symbol you can examine to learn more about vampires if you wish, as well as miscellaneous loot in the cells. However, the most important is in the last shelving/hole on the left as you follow Regis. In the chest beside the skeleton is the final piece of armor, the gauntlets. Continue down the hall and it'll cut to a small cutscene before Regis gives you some bait to place around to lure monsters there.
You'll have to blast away some debris to place two of the lures and once all are set you have to talk to Regis to begin. Prepare for a big fight, during which you'll be surrounded by many necrophages and an odd fleder or katakan. Try to keep your Quen up at all times (tip: meditate until night if you have to, and drink a Superior Tawny Owl), as multiple scurvers and rotfiends will be able to one-shot Geralt as they explode. Especially with Protective Coating, it's best to use Necrophage Oil and simply avoid the vampires. You must keep killing monsters until Regis' bloodlust builds up, but don't worry about more than your immediate safety - 10 kills are enough, then shortly a cutscene will trigger and all the rest will run away.
When Regis reaches his transformation, Geralt gets the last ingredient and heads back to the cemetery to finish the concoction. You can then talk for a bit before you once more go through a cutscene showing Dettlaff and how he met Count de la Croix and then the latter's death. Then after a short conversation with Regis, your next lead to follow will be the bootblack near Beauclair Port.
This quest completes here (1,000) and Where Children Toil, Toys Waste Away will begin. However, note that there's another, secondary quest - Amidst the Mill's Grist - only available until you finish the next main one. You may have recognized its location from the vision.","Meet Regis at Mère-Lachaiselongue Cemetery.

"https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Where_Children_Toil,_Toys_Waste_Away",Main_quests,"Head to Beauclair Port to find the bootblack, though note he's only there between 8am and 8pm. When you show up during that time, he's busy with some irate men. Approach and eventually you have 3 choices: say you're his father, a witcher, or not their concern. No matter how you answer though, the men will attack you and you must fistfight them (600 if you win, 400 if you lose). Whether you knocked them out or lost the fight, a ducal guard will then approach to see what's going on. Again, no matter how you respond, he'll arrest the men and you can then talk to the bootblack.
However, the boy has clearly learned the streets: he'll tell you what he knows, but only for a sum of 500  to finance his business. You have a small room to negotiate down, but you can also use Axii instead (requires Delusion level 2 for a minimum of 35).
Important: Paying the full 500  (no negotiating or Axii) will count as ""Proof of Generosity"" for There Can Be Only One.
When it feels like it's not going anywhere, Regis pops up feeling much better, and convinces the boy to tell them where Dettlaff has been staying. Now follow Regis along the port until you reach The Rocking Horse. Interact with the door, which is of course locked, but Regis will take care of the issue. (600) You can then examine the toys, though none of them hold any significance. What you really want to see is upstairs on the second floor. Just as you reach the second floor, you'll see a woman's face on the wall opposite you that can be examined as well as the music box and tools on the work table. However, the pieces you need here are two documents in the room: the suspicious letter near the stairs in a small jug and the letters in a corner to the right of the work table.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Wine_is_Sacred,Main_quests,"Head to Beauclair Palace to talk with Anna Henrietta, with Damien de la Tour in attendance. Choose whichever options you wish during the conversation and eventually the duchess will agree it's best to try and free the hostage woman. Geralt then shows her the wine-stained letter and the ducal sommelier is called to inspect it. He quickly determines that the stain is from a 1269 Sangreal - wine made exclusively for the ducal family and only made at one location, Castel Ravello Vineyard. No matter what you say, the duchess will make up her mind to personally visit the vineyard and you are to escort her together with Damien. You can choose to head out now or wait.
Upon telling Damien that you're ready you'll start riding to Castel Ravello. After a short while, you'll see a wagon is under attack by a few panthers. You can dispose of them (450) or just keep going. Note that it's also possible to cancel the panther attack by falling behind Anna and Damien right before they reach the wagon, and then catch up with them after they pass it.
Note: If you run away from the panthers (or the escort altogether), the objective will eventually fail and you'll have to meet the captain and Anarietta at the vineyard, where they will criticize you about abandoning them, but then the rest proceeds as normal.
The ride then continues and you arrive to talk with Fabricio, the vineyard's owner. Regardless of what you say, he's a bit snobby at first, but soon you're free to question him. You'll only be able to ask him two of the three questions, but it doesn't matter which ones as Anarietta gets fed up and decides to just personally inspect the barrels herself.
Investigate the barrels[]
Follow the duchess to the cellars and, when prompted, read the nearby ledger. However, as it appears it's all in order, it's time to check the barrels directly. You can read the signs on the bottom floor, but the one you want is upstairs, on the far end from the stairs. Initially, you have to knock on each one to see if one's hollow, but all of them sound full so tasting is necessary. If you haven't already looted them, go back downstairs and grab a wooden hammer and barrel tap (they're everywhere), and return. You'll need to tap any two barrels for Annarietta before she tastes one that's clearly not Sangreal. You then go back to talk to Fabricio and learn he's sold some of the wine to a Cintrian aristocrat, and even has another barrel prepared for him. Geralt and Damien then decide to prepare an ambush for the buyer's intermediates at Fort Astre Ruins and you can choose to go there immediately or delay if you wish.
The ambush[]
When you go to Fort Astre, there's another cinematic and a large battle ensues, during which you have the support of the ducal guards against a lot of bandits. You're not going to be instantly hit when it starts, but be prepared regardless, and note that there are some exploding barrels around the place.
Once they're all cut down, go with any of the answers during the small conversations between Damien, Anarietta and the survivor, but ultimately the only thing you learn is that the buyer is simply known as ""The Cintrian"". You then have to go to a Ducal Guard Post, and you can choose to do that immediately or meet the duchess there while Damien tries to find information on the mysterious man. If you choose to stay and meet up with her later, you can loot the bodies of the thugs as well as pick up 500 florens from the cart.
At the post, Geralt and the duchess discuss the situation while waiting for Damien. The captain is late, but finally appears and shares what he's learned. You have your picks on what to say during all of this, but it makes no difference. Eventually it's decided that you and Annarietta will sneak into the next Mandragora party to seek the Cintrian, ending the quest.","Report to the duchess about your hunt for the Beast.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Man_from_Cintra,Main_quests,"Make your way to the Tailor's Workshop's to pick up some suitable clothes if you wish, or head straight for Mountebank Alley. If you go during the night, on the way you may encounter four bandits seeking the reward on your head, confirming Damien's earlier words were true. The nearby guards will help in the fight and you can loot them as well to find a contract, just to clarify the point.
If you don't have any suitable clothes and want to, go to the tailor. Any formal attire except the Skellige one works, even other formal wear like the ornate robe from the Hearts of Stone expansion (which will lead to a remark from Anna Henrietta later). Don't bother buying a mask as none of them are correct. Once you have everything, equip your new attire and head to the alley.
When you arrive, the duchess is nowhere in sight, so you must wait for her. When she does, she'll comment on your attire and then give you the appropriate mask to wear. You can then talk to the doorman to learn a bit more about the performances before heading in.
Here, you can take part in a number of activities. As it doesn't matter how few or many you do (what happens in the quest will happen regardless) feel free to look around some. The optional activities include:
throwing paint balls at the canvas (just to the left of the stairs)
interacting with the mimes (just in front of the stairs)
absinthe sample on various tables
light a lantern on the back railing
There's several others you can do that don't show up as markers, like watching the master illusionist. Once you're ready, head into the first alcove on the left side (if facing towards the back railing) to find a painter at work. You can talk first about the painting that leads to some interesting tidbits. Regardless, you learn this isn't Cecilia, but she did see Cecilia with the Cintrian wander off to the refreshment tables. Head over there where there's a few things to examine, but what you want is on the table, the heart-shaped box. Using your Witcher Senses, follow the scent all the way around the courtyard and through a door to find a bodyguard. However, before you can figure out another way, the bodyguard recognizes the duchess' voice and offers to help, letting you go upstairs. While there's several doors, the perfume trail (and the other two being locked) indicates the middle door as Cecilia's room. Head in for a cutscene.
You can examine the body and a handprint on the door frame. Head out onto the balcony and cross over to the next balcony where you can also examine the broken pot and footprints before heading around and climbing up the ladder and entering the next room. Here, there's a number of things you need to examine: the mirror, blood stain, jewelry box, broken necklace (which will then let you pick up the valuable jewel beside it), the slashed painting, the knife near the door, the knocked over inkwell, the candelabrum near the window, and the blood on the window's ledge. Once you have the knife and jewel, and have examined the window, a cutscene and a long conversation begins. Respond however you wish to everything before Regis and Dettlaff appear. You'll have a timed reaction choice here before pulling Regis aside for a private conversation, then back to the others before eventually ending the quest. (1500)
While the quest may be finished, you can go find the Cintrian's body if you wish for a small comment by Geralt. To find it, go to the intersection that's east of Orianna's estate and look among the lower part of the cliffs to find the body. If reading this beforehand, you can easily mark its approximate location while looking out the window he went through.","[Optional] Put on clothes Anna Henrietta will consider appropriate for the soiree.

After the cutscene, you are dropped into battle. Take out the guards here, then make your way further into the courtyard, taking out more guards as necessary. (500) Eventually you'll find Roderick with more backup. Cut them all down and talk to Roderick to learn something isn't right in regards to the hostage and Syanna. (500) You have the option to help him afterwards.
Important: Helping Roderick here will count as ""Proof of Compassion"" for There Can Be Only One.
Carry on through the wooden gate, taking out enemies as you go. A notably strong enemy is Iron Borg on the left side, but you can just run past to the narrow balcony ahead and never trigger him. After you take out a group of archers there, head up the stairs for a cutscene and where you're now joined by Dettlaff and Regis. (500) As long as you move at a slow enough pace, they'll do all the heavy lifting, taking out almost everyone that gets in your way so you may only get a few swipes in.
Approach the manor and another cutscene starts where you see the truth for yourself: Rhena and Syanna are one and the same person. You may say whatever you wish during the dialogues, though the more concrete options result in better insight from Geralt. Dettlaff then orders Syanna to meet him in 3 days to explain herself or else he'll attack Beauclair, before flying off. Despite Syanna stating she'd meet him though, on exiting the building Anna Henrietta, grateful to see her sister, orders her held in a safe location and demands Geralt to find and kill Dettlaff before he makes good on his word and attacks the city. This will then end the quest (1,500) and immediately jump into the next quest, 3 days later.","Meet Damien at Count de la Croix's mill after midnight.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Night_of_Long_Fangs,Main_quests,"This quest immediately starts after the end of the last one, 3 days later and with no luck finding Dettlaff. You can be polite or answer however you wish to the duchess, though the more rude answers will cause some shock from the others. Before much else can be said, a wounded soldier appears: apparently Dettlaff made good on his word and is attacking the city. A bruxa will then appear that you must fight. (200) Afterwards, a long conversation starts with Regis, where you discuss two options to proceed. What you initially choose here though won't be set in stone, it merely determines if Regis accompanies you into the infested city or not. He'll only accompany you if you choose to find Damien, but it's not a big deal even if you go that route on your own, as his help is only a minor convenience.
There are 2 different paths to complete this quest, both of them leading to different missions and outcomes. However, Orianna's path has an extra quest - Blood Simple - that you can safely do before returning to the other route. Regis will always ask you for a final decision after getting Damien or Orianna's help. Note that the city is crawling with monsters and looters in almost every alley so it's best to take the most straightforward path to an objective than go exploring (unless you wish to get some loot or ). However, if you do wish to do everything, it is best to find Damien first, and then expect Fleders at many places around the palace if you go exploring.
Note: Since the quest takes place during the night, using Superior Tawny Owl at the start is very convenient.
If you chose to head down on your own to the city, as you make your way from the palace to the city's bridge, you might encounter a katakan trying to devour the knight Delwyn of Creigiau, who you can choose to save or not. You can do this if Regis is with you as well, but you would have to backtrack a bit and then don't go any further away to avoid losing him.
Head into the city where, as soon as you cross the bridge, a garkain drops down and attacks nearby guards. Further along, if you're following the objective's path, just east of The Ducal Camerlengo is another bruxa. If you instead try to take the southern path at the Camerlengo, a fleder will attack at the end of that alley. Note: If Regis is with you, he will try to lead you through the bruxa path and will stay in place if you deviate before that, but you can still go through the fleder and once you're down the stairs he will continue and catch up.
Still following the path indicated will take you to the first section to find Damien, even if you're trying to find Orianna. Explosions go off in the building as you see a fleder near the center of the square. Kill it, then, if trying to find Damien or just want some extra XP, use your Witcher Senses to examine one of the bodies and the blood trail going between the Infirmary and the other buildings, which is the same path one must take to Orianna. A man on fire will cross your path but there's nothing you can do for him. Continuing to follow the path leads to a wagon barricade you can examine before entering the main market area of Beauclair, now occupied by both an alp and bruxa. Deal with the ladies, and now it's time for the paths to split. Note: you can still seek out Damien here (who gives you a lead to Syanna) and then go find Orianna after speaking with him, before running off to get Syanna.
Go see Orianna[]
Continue following the indicated path southeast, where around the turn, near Dupont & Sons, you'll run into another garkain. Then head straight to Lady Orianna's estate to find her. Just outside her door are some guards talking and their conversation changes a bit depending if you already found Damien or not. You can listen to them or hurry inside.
Orianna seems in a bit of a hurry. You can talk some but ultimately you'll have to go with her to the local orphanage, no matter what you say. (200) Once you get there, you'll clearly see something's wrong. You can use Axii on the boy for 40  (even if you don't have Delusion), or Orianna will hypnotize him herself, and then talk with him to learn what happened. Afterwards, you can try to suggest tending to the boy's wounds, but Orianna feels it's more important to find the beast that attacked and she'll deal with the wounds. This then starts the next quest, Blood Simple, and this one is temporarily marked as complete.
Important: Both paths are unique and worth going through, but committing to Orianna's path locks you to a single ending of the story. Read up on the next quests if you don't want to make a blind decision here.
Go find Syanna[]
Follow the tracks north and, as you near the Cianfanelli Bank, you see yet another fleder just outside it. After you kill it, it'll cut to talking to Damien. Choose whatever you like and he'll reveal that he last saw Syanna being escorted to the palace's playroom. (200) If Regis is with you, you can either head straight to the playroom or tell him you'll meet him there. If you head straight there, mind the fleder that attacks as you get close. If Regis isn't with you, interact with the nearby birds to let Regis know where to meet, then make your way to the palace. However, be prepared as you cross the bridge and make your way up the hill, as an alp is here and further up, a fleder. Or, if you don't feel like fighting yet more vampires, ride Roach to the meeting point, just outside the playroom's door.
Path merge: If you changed your mind at the end of Blood Simple and decide to go find Syanna and didn't seek out Damien yet, Regis explains he already talked with Damien and learned Syanna was last seen headed towards the old playroom and will cut to the two being just outside the room.
You can examine a body just outside the door, but don't learn much from it. Interact with the door and Regis will use his abilities to unlock it shortly for you. Inside, you can examine the globe right in front of the entrance but it's not important. Head upstairs to find numerous objects, to which Regis will make some amusing anecdotes about. However, the only thing you really need to examine is the journal, which will cut to Geralt reading aloud the various entries. Important: While only one of them (about the Land of a Thousand Fables...) is needed to exit out of the book, be sure to read all of them to unlock decisive options later.
Once done, interact with the painting near the stairs to find a hidden golden key, then go to the locked wardrobe and open it to find the book named ""The Land of a Thousand Fables"" and interact with it. Important: Once you interact with the book, your choice in paths is set. If you suddenly change your mind or want to learn more about Orianna first, this is the time to do it.","Kill the vampire.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Beyond_Hill_and_Dale...,Main_quests,"Oddly, this quest actually starts near the last few steps of The Night of Long Fangs but doesn't officially end the previous quest until you enter the Land of a Thousand Fables.
On entering the massive illusion, you won't have access to your maps and Geralt will note it's so powerful, there's no way to dispel the illusion. So, it's time to follow the yellow brick road to find Syanna. You can read the signpost in front of you if you wish. Otherwise, head west along the yellow brick road. Note that, possibly due to the illusion, your map's path indicator is off and will try to take you up a steep hill near the borders, so ignore it for now and just follow the orange objective indicator instead.
At the first path split, continue straight, then at the next go right. As soon as you start crossing the bridge, an archespore will appear on the other side. Once killed, continue along the path, jumping across the gap, and onwards until you come across another bridge and a nearby hut. Approach close enough for a cutscene where Syanna is trying to get someone out of the locked hearth (250). The Wicked Witch will then notice you and attack. Once she's dead, Syanna finds the key and open the hearth, letting Jack out and asks him about some beans and he states it's best to talk to Joss to learn their locations.
At this point you can now talk to Syanna and learn more about her before asking about the beans. She then reveals that, like the fairy tale, 3 magical beans are needed to grow a stalk that'll take you to a giant's castle in the sky and the location of the only other exit out of the illusion, as Anna Henrietta cut off the other route. However, the fablesphere is collapsing and while they won't attack Syanna if she doesn't attack them, Geralt is an unwelcome guest, so you'll need to keep an eye out for pixies on occasion.
Afterwards, head out the opposite gate from where you entered and follow the path through a dark ravine. In the widest part you'll come across some pixies. Once the group is dispatched, continue along the path until you come across some unicorns. Mount up and continue along the now dirt path and shortly you'll come across Joss, the boy who cried wolf who, true to his tale, is lying and saying everything's ok but he's in fact under attack by wolves. Kill them, then ask him about each bean and he'll lie, or rather ""reverse the truth"". Syanna will mention two options for the blue bean, as there are 2 groups in the fablesphere with 3 characters, but the other two can be narrowed down to one for each (500).
Red bean[]
The red bean was swallowed by the Big Bad Wolf so from Joss, take the path that goes left of the tower then the right path when it splits again to find a red hut and a hungover wolf. Talk to him to learn he refuses to answer unless you partake in acting out the tale, but as Little Red Riding Hood is dead, you have no choice but for Syanna to act in her place but you need the red hood to do so. So jump into the well and her body (and the hunter's) should be right below you. Loot her for the hood, then follow the submerged tunnel out. Once you climb out of the water, Syanna will don the hood and you'll go bug the wolf once more. When ready, start to act the tale and be ready to fight him. Once dead, Geralt retrieves the red bean from his stomach. Important: at this point, Syanna will talk and, if this is your first bean, make sure to ask what happened to hear her story if you want to try and get a good ending later.
Yellow bean[]
The yellow bean is hidden with Longlocks, high up in her tower. This one you'll do alone so climb your way up and then into the tower. As soon as you walk into her room, her wraith will attack. Eventually she summons weaker armed corpses to assist her while she regenerates, so keep that in mind to quickly finish her off. Once done, loot the yellow bean from the pillow on her bed. To leave, climb up onto the platform, through the window, and dive into the waters below. Syanna will talk to you. If this is the second bean, she'll talk about Dettlaff and you can ask all the side conversations.
Blue bean[]
The correct location for this one is the Three Little Pigs. However, if you feel like exploring everything, you can go see the Three Bears as well. If you do though, don't loot the food off the table or else all 3 will wake up and attack.
Make your way to the northwestern point on the map to find the only house still standing: the brick one. Tear it down with Aard then prepare to battle 3 piglets. Their fighting tactics are identical to boars, so use the appropriate measures and kill them off. Afterwards, loot the bean off the lone table in the hut and, once again, Syanna will approach and talk for a third time, remarking on Geralt's joke. Choose whatever you like and then it's time to plant them. Finding all three beans gives 800. Important: before you do, make sure you take care of any quests in the area. Also, if you want to try for a good ending, you must visit the Little Flint Girl.
Little Flint Girl[]
Approach the only normal sized looking settlement (to the north of Longlocks' tower) to see a young girl selling drugs. Talk with her and Syanna will see the girl's wearing a ribbon that was given to her as a kid for protection and demands it back as it's a small memento of happier times. The Little Flint Girl won't just give it for free though: you can pay 500  for it (50) or try to win it by beating her at gwent. Important: to try and get a good ending, you must get the ribbon for Syanna.
Beanstalk[]
Once you're taken care of everything, it's time to leave. Go to the field beside the small settlement and kill the pixies that appear, then use Witcher Senses to find the spot near the middle of the search area to plant the beans. Once done, a cutscene will start and you'll now be outside the Cloud Giant's castle. Except he's not exactly accepting visitors. Once you've killed him, depending on how you conversed earlier with Syanna, you have the chance to have sex with her. Note: The sex scene with her is unique, and your choice here has no consequences at all. If you wish to have it, choose the first option - ""Useful, how?"", then ""[Let her have her way with you]"".
Whatever the case, loot the giant, then head towards the bridge where a will o' the wisp is before you. If you want some loot, follow it around and down below the bridge and into a cave area where it circles above a campfire. Light it then after a moment, you can now pick up Gesheft. Exit out the other side and climb up the ledges on the right and make your way back to the bridge and enter the courtyard. There's nothing here to loot that you can take back with you when you exit the illusion, so just follow Syanna to the other side where the exit is, the well. Jump in and you'll be spat out into the fountain at Beauclair Palace where Regis is waiting. After a tense moment, the quest completes (800) and you head directly to Tesham Mutna Ruins.","If Geralt talks to Damien:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Simple,Main_quests,"Having followed Orianna to the local orphanage, you learn some beast attacked, killing almost all the children. Once free to move around again, you can examine the 2 bodies inside the building, then the one just outside the doorway. Out here there's a number of things to examine: the claw marks going up the building, the body against the tree with the swing, footprints leading away from the first body, the blood on the rock ledge, the body just below the ledge, and the body near the orphanage's arch. However, the most important piece to continue is the green spot on the pillar near the entrance and steps, which will pick up a scent trail.
Follow the trail a short distance to find some tracks that go over the ledge. On this side you'll find another body. If you examine it, Geralt will correctly conclude the beast is an alpha garkain, even if you didn't examine any other pieces of evidence. Read the bestiary entry now for an extra 100. On the other side of the pen examine the wagon tracks and, if you haven't already guessed, it's best to ride Roach for this part to go faster. No need to dismount as Geralt will automatically comment when the tracks go off the road. Continue following into a small rut where, at the end, you'll see what became of the wagon.
You can examine the horse's body and the woman's, but you may have already noticed where the garkain is with your Witcher Senses. If you haven't, look northwest towards a bridge to see a red audio indicator, that's where the alpha garkain is hiding. Head there and, once you're close enough, a cutscene occurs before the fighting starts. Use whichever tactics you find useful against it and, once the deed is done, loot it for a Garkain trophy. (200) Before you leave and head back to the orphanage, you can also loot the body near the bridge to recover Orianna's letter to learn something rather interesting and to which Geralt will comment on.
Make your way back to the orphanage and open the door to catch Orianna red-handed. Respond however you wish, but in the end Geralt will decide to let her go for now, though vowing to return one day to deal with her. (800) You'll also be given a magic key that's needed to open the Unseen Elder's cave. Nearby are some birds in the trees; interact with them to let Regis know where to meet. You can then head straight to the docks or stay here and go manually, but if you choose the latter you'll encounter an alp at the city gates. Once you meet with Regis, this is your final chance to change your mind to go find Syanna or stay the course and go see the Unseen Elder.","Search the orphanage using your Witcher Senses.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/What_Lies_Unseen,Main_quests,"After choosing to forge ahead to see the Unseen Elder, you can choose to head out or say you need more time. If you choose to go now, Regis will join you on the boat and converse for a bit, otherwise choosing the latter means to go without Regis' comments. However you get there, follow the steps around to where Regis is now waiting at the sealed door and interact with it to reveal the entrance, then head inside.
You'll eventually come across a split where a submerged path and an upper path are. Both lead to the same room eventually, but if you want Regis' help, take the dry path until you come across a fleder. Once killed, you'll notice there are 3 paths off the room: the one you used to get there, one with a lit torch, and then another one with a ledge. If you do a running jump you can easily get over it to find some loot, including in the chest the Hen Gaidth gauntlets and steel sword (if you took the water tunnel, this is where it'd have come out).
Back in the fleder room, take the path marked by the torch until you reach the next room and a cutscene will start. Note: drinking Black Blood before this has no effect on the Elder. No matter what you say it's clear the Unseen Elder isn't accepting visitors and tosses Geralt into another part of the cave. Important: Once you've regained movement, be sure to look behind you to pick up the two swords you had equipped (and fell off).
Around the stone column is one of your health potions. Pick it up and drink it and Geralt will pass out and then come to, this time with full health and movement once more. (300) Depending on what you had on you, you may have quite a bit of items you lost in your fall. Before the next ledge is typically your crossbow and bolts as well as a small item, your other healing potion. If you didn't already, pick up your swords on the other end and that should be all your lost items.
Escape the cave[]
Now, head up the ledge to find a highly unusual room where water moves in very odd directions. Jump down for Geralt to comment about the other ledge, then go to the campfire and pick up the mage's notes. You can examine the nearest waterfall for Geralt to comment on it, but otherwise look and examine the footprints near the campfire and follow them to the left side of the main chamber. Note that the path will split just before the next room. The path up the ledge goes to a dead end room with 3 protofleders, a unique vampire to this cave system, but more importantly the room contains a chest with the Hen Gaidth mask and trousers.
Continuing along the main path into the next room you'll run into 2 protofleders (your first if you didn't go up the previous path). The footprints pick up again on the other side and continue up the ledge. Follow across the bridge until you find an old megascope to examine and a second mage's notes to read. Continue following the path to a stream flowing upwards and you find yourself this time walking upside down on the ceiling part of the cave. Right in front of you, against the wall, is another chest, this time with the final pieces of the Hen Gaidth set: the armor and boots.
Follow the path until you get to a gap between you and a protofleder. If you stand behind the roof outcropping, near the corner in the path, you'll see to your left (the center of the room) a ledge you can jump to. However, you need to find something to appease the Elder, so jump across the other gap to fight the protofleder and search the mage's body for a crumpled letter and read it. Also, the unique silver sword, Cantata, is next to the mage's body. Now, turn back to the gap you jumped over and pick up the rose-colored stone next to it (200) - the peace offering you need to show the Elder. Then jump over and use the previous mentioned gap to get to the middle platform. Head around until Geralt remarks on the large stone before you. As you might have guessed, use Aard on the base and it'll float ""upwards"" creating the needed step on the bottom of the cave to reach the other side, then turn around and jump into the large ""upward"" flowing waterfall and you'll end up back near the campfire. (200)
Speak to the Unseen Elder[]
Now climb up onto the previously unreachable ledge and make your way out of the cave. You will eventually return to the main chamber with the Unseen Elder and an immobile Regis. He will accept the offer, and then you can talk to him. However, note two things:
Do NOT ask more than one side conversation. He will give a warning not to waste his time with the first one and if asked a second, he will instantly kill Geralt, requiring one to load a previous save.
The second time you must choose out of 3 options, the only correct choice is the third (""Dettlaff spells trouble for you""). Answering incorrectly twice (the 1st and 2nd options) will again, lead to him instantly killing Geralt and having to load a previous save.
Afterwards, you can choose what to say and he'll agree to force Dettlaff to meet you at Tesham Mutna Ruins. (800) Once outside, you can talk with Regis a bit before heading off to the meeting point.","Go to the Unseen Elder's lair.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Tesham_Mutna,Main_quests,"What happens next depends on a number of previous choices:
If you went to see the Unseen Elder, Dettlaff will show up and will give you no choice but to fight him.
If you brought Syanna, Dettlaff will show up and try to kill her:
If you got her back the ribbon from the Little Flint Girl, she'll be teleported away to safety and, enraged, Dettlaff will force you to fight him.
If she doesn't have the ribbon, she'll die and you can choose:
to fight Dettlaff
to let Dettlaff go
Regardless of whether you fight Dettlaff, if Syanna is dead Anna Henrietta will have Geralt thrown into jail, starting the quest Burlap is the New Stripe.
Note: Defeating Dettlaff will count as ""Proof of Valor"" for There Can Be Only One.
If you do fight him, prepare for 3 different stages. Luckily, while Regis keeps him busy, you can prepare yourself with any necessary decoctions, oils, weapon repairs, and so forth. Important: use this break to save your game before jumping into the fray. The game will not create automated progress saves and so if you die during any of them, you must re-do all the stages. Other important things to keep in mind:
At the start, all your alchemy items are replenished, but any decoctions and toxicity from before are still in effect - use White Honey to reset them if you want to. You're also allowed to swap out skills.
Dettlaff is immune to any bomb that purely give a status effect, such as Northern Wind, but Grapeshot or Dancing Star will work.
Dettlaff is unaffected by Axii, and Yrden won't be that useful.
A crossbow bolt, Aard or Igni is useful during Stage 2, Yrden's alternate form Magic Trap will work too (see below)
Always put on Quen.
On higher difficulties, forget about Black Blood; avoid getting hit as much as possible as Dettlaff can kill you very quickly.
Unfortunately due to a bug or intentionally Vampire Oil, or any other for that matter, has no effect on Detlaff, so skills like Protective Coating will also not work. So a much better option is to use Griffin decoction and/or Arachas decoction if you need more damage reduction.
Consider equipping White Raffard's Decoction.
Stage 1, Humanoid Form[]
This is the same form that you faced Dettlaff in when you first tracked him down to the warehouse. He has ranged dash attacks and will usually dodge away after he's taken one hit. Similar to facing Olgierd von Everec in the Hearts of Stone expansion, a short-dodge-fast-attack pattern dodging behind him and doing a quick strike usually works best. Once you've done enough damage he will transform into his next state.
Stage 2, Flying Form[]
In this form you have to be patient; there is only one point during his attack patterns where he's truly vulnerable. While he's in the air, as mentioned before he's immune to everything you could use to knock him down. His dashing slashes are easy to dodge with a roll, however his bat wave attack can be tricky but not impossible, as soon as he starts gathering bats, run away in the opposite direction. Try to get as much distance from him as you can. This leaves you more time to see the bats coming and dodge or roll away easily. When he dives down onto the ground and stays there for a bit, this is when you have a precious few seconds to hit him as hard as you can before he flies back up and sends out a short ranged shockwave. You can also wait until he dives at you and perform a well timed Aard, Igni, or crossbow bolt. He will crash to the ground and will be vulnerable for a few seconds. If you unlocked Magic Trap it will also work if he swoops down near it. Take advantage of this with 3-4 fast attacks, 2 strong attacks, or even a Dancing Star bomb. Rinse and repeat until he goes to the third stage.
Stage 3, Body Illusion[]
In this stage when you're in the illusion of the inside of a fictional version of Dettlaff's chest, there are several pulsing hearts around the walls of the chamber. You have to destroy these hearts while fending off the Dettlaff blood clones. The clones can hit VERY hard and destroying them doesn't do any actual damage to the ""true"" Dettlaff himself, but destroying one can give a few precious seconds of time to focus on one of the hearts until another is spawned. If you're skilled enough, you can also try counter-attacking the clones the same way it was done in Stage 1, but note this is far riskier. Once you've destroyed 3 hearts, Dettlaff is finally defeated.
After the 3 stages are over, he'll be down to sliver of health, but so weak that you get to execute him however you wish, after which you get a cutscene and the quest completes.","Unless Syanna is dead and you choose to let Dettlaff go:
[Optional] Prepare for the fight.
Help Regis fight Dettlaff.
Defeat Dettlaff."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Pomp_and_Strange_Circumstance,Main_quests,"After fighting and finishing off Dettlaff while keeping Syanna alive, the duchess is very grateful and plans to bestow Toussaint's highest honor, the Order of Vitis Vinifera, on Geralt. However, Regis ponders over who the intended 5th victim is, to which you can respond 3 different ways: to go immediately to see the bootblack, say you'll meet him later at the bootblack's station, or that you don't care to find out who the 5th victim was to be. If you choose the last one, the optional objective to visit the bootlack won't appear, but you can still go if you wish.
Important: if you went to see the Unseen Elder, even if you do all the next optional steps, you won't be able to sway what happens in the end. You can do it though to learn more and get some XP. See the Ceremony section for full list of requirements to save both sisters.
The 5th victim[]
Head to the bootblack who will shine your shoes while you ask him questions. Even if you don't have any on, Geralt will equip some. He'll then reveal the letters came from beggars and after some prodding, Regis gets him to reveal they likely came from the shelter nearby. Go upstairs to the shelter and enter the courtyard to find 2 men arguing with the shelter owner. Knock out the 2 men (doesn't really matter if you lose the fight), and the shelter owner will let you stay to wait for the beggars to appear to question them. The one with the 5th letter eventually reveals he still has it. No matter the choice, he hands it over and you learn the last victim was to be Syanna's own sister, Anna Henrietta. Respond however you like to Regis and he'll go wait for you after the ceremony. (50)
Talk to Syanna[]
Head to the palace and go with whichever choice to get the guard to let you through. The conversation that unfolds here will have an effect on the outcome if you met the previous requirements (went to the Land of a Thousand Fables, read the relevant entries in the journal, and listened to all of Syanna's story). Otherwise, no matter what you choose, the outcome will be the same. If you did all previous requirements though and wish to save the sisters, the correct conversation choices are:
Cause she turned her back on you, forgot about you.
Ever thought to forgive her?
After the conversation, the guard will tell you Damien de la Tour wishes to talk to you. You can then reveal to him the truth or withhold it, but again, this has no bearing on the outcome.
Ceremony[]
Once you're ready to begin the ceremony, approach Damien and let him know. If you'd changed out of the fancy clothes, they'll be re-equipped. During the ceremony (200), you have the chance to tell Anarietta personally that her sister wished to kill her, but this won't change anything. When Syanna is brought in, choose whichever options you wish, which change slightly if you had gone to the Land of a Thousand Fables, but again has no effect on the outcome. What happens next depends on several factors.
To save the sisters you must have:
Completed the quest Beyond Hill and Dale...
Read the first 2 entries in the governess' journal
Agreed to listen to Syanna's story while finding the magic beans
Decided to investigate the 5th victim then ask Syanna about it
Used the correct responses when talking to Syanna after learning the 5th victim (see previous section)
Anything else (didn't listen to her story, chose the wrong responses in the tower, etc.) will lead to both their deaths.
If you didn't do any of the above requirements, Syanna will kill her sister and Damien shoots a crossbow bolt, killing Syanna. Time passes and Geralt will talk to a local seller. No matter what you say, she'll give you the flowers she intended to leave at Anarietta's grave herself. Make your way to Temple Cemetery, where Damien is taking it really hard. Answer however you like. Damien then reveals Syanna is also buried in the same room before you enter. You can place a flower on both graves or just Anarietta's. After a moment, Regis will come to retrieve you and head out to Mère-Lachaiselongue Cemetery.
However, if you managed to get Syanna to forgive her sister, the two will instead argue in front of the court before forgiving each other (200) and that will be the end and Geralt will join Regis at the cemetery.
Hunting mandrakes[]
Whatever the outcome, Geralt will discuss it with Regis around the campfire before Regis decides to go get more mandrake roots. As fresh mandrake is toxic, even to witchers, he gives you some gloves and a mask to help pick some. Note that if you don't don them on, Geralt's toxicity levels will rise when one is picked and picking both without protection or lowering the levels after the first one will kill you. After you pick two roots, go to Regis' spot only to find him gone. Use Witcher Senses to track him through the cemetery and find him under attack by several bruxae. After they're killed he explains he must soon leave the area as, while viewed as a traitor by vampires that were loyal to Dettlaff, vampires operate by a basic principle of ""out of sight, out of mind"" and thus won't chase him if he goes somewhere else. The two will then head back and have more discussions.","Unless you said the 5th victim no longer matters:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Burlap_is_the_New_Stripe,Main_quests,"Turns out Anna Henrietta isn't very happy Geralt got her sister killed, and so she had the witcher thrown into prison until his punishment is decided.
Nearby, an inmate, Handsome Jacques, will chat for a bit, mentioning how he can get stuff for other inmates. Once he's finished talking, you can follow him to the laundry room or check out the two small notices in the prison. Use your Witcher Senses on the wall that was behind Jacques while you were talking to him to see the brick that starts the side quest, The Perks of Being a Jailbird. You can also interact with the gwent players on the other side (it doesn't matter if you win or lose). Once done, follow Jacques through the door.
He'll direct you to pick up the dirty clothes and soap. The dirty clothes are in a box opposite the laundry tubs, and the soap is near the stairs you came down, on the floor. Once you have everything, interact with the laundry tub, then pick up the stick. This will lead to a cutscene and a few familiar faces appear, itching for a chance to pay back Geralt for landing them in jail, with the dialogue a bit different based on if Geralt won or lost the first fistfight. No matter what you do they'll attack, though using Axii (requires Delusion level 2, earning 35) will make it a fight against just two instead of three.
After they've been dealt with, guards will run in and talk a bit with Geralt before shifting to another cutscene with him back in his cell, a week later. He is soon retrieved by another guard who takes him to the courtyard to watch as an inmate, sentenced to death, is beheaded. The guard then leads Geralt away and into a tower where Damien de la Tour is waiting. Eventually, he'll reveal that Geralt is free to go thanks to a certain bard, despite Damien feeling Geralt should rot in prison.
Dandelion then appears, revealing he was able to reason with the Duchess and while she is still angry, she agreed to let Geralt go and keep Corvo Bianco, but he either doesn't get any of the reward (If Geralt chose to spare Dettlaff) or he gets only partial reward (3,750 , if he chose to fight Dettlaff) and she doesn't want to see him ever again. After you finish the conversation, a guard will then lead you to the gate. Make sure to pick up your stuff from the chest in the small room between the two gates, then leave the prison. Regis is waiting for you and will eventually reveal his thoughts on who the intended 5th victim was meant to be. You can choose to investigate or not.
If you do choose to investigate, the quest will follow the same path as in Pomp and Strange Circumstance up to retrieving the letter. You will go and talk to the bootblack, who will then suggest visiting the shelter. Here, you will need to beat up two peasants who are harassing the shelter's owner. Once done, the beggars will drop in for food and will eventually reveal the 5th letter and intended victim. You can now choose to reveal this information to Anna Henrietta or forget it and get a drink with Regis. As nothing comes with revealing it to the Duchess, who will deny it and become visibly angry and upset, one may prefer to just skip it and go with Regis instead.","Go to the laundry.

Lynx Crag[]
At the start of the climb you will see a non-hostile Panther, and soon after it you will find a cave. You can be explicitly directed to the cave later, but to save more walking around just head into it now.
Inside you will encounter some Kikimores and their eggs which you can destroy with Igni. If you search the cave thoroughly you will find a chest to the right of the southern entrance on a higher plane. If you climb it to get the loot and use your witcher senses you will notice a body on further higher plane you can climb from there. Examine the body and you will find Sir Gareth's bone. Now climb out of the cave through the other exit, go left and climb the wall there. After that follow the path and you will soon reach the hut.
Inside the hut you will find several objects to examine and you can collect a few books by doing so. However, the important one is the bear pelt on the wall, just keep in mind once you interact with it, you will be locked out of the hut after the following events. Underneath the pelt there are 4 objects, among which is a kerchief which Geralt will take (50), after which the home owner - the Witch of Lynx Crag - will appear together with the panther from earlier. You will have 3 ways to deal with her: threaten her, say you can lift the curse yourself, or plead with her. The latter is only available if you read the book Jacob gave you.
Important: There is also an optional conversation line to ask what happened to Sir Gareth, which you must do if you wish to get a good ending.
Force the Witch to help[]
If chosen to threaten, Geralt will have to fight the Witch and her Panther. Be quick as the witch has a very strong magic attack, which can one-shot you on higher difficulties - open your inventory immediately and use all potions, decoctions and oils that you may need. Once she is almost dead she will give up and agree to lift the curse. Return to the Tree to find Jacob is missing. Use your witcher senses to find footprints, which will take you to his corpse. Turns out Morholt was possessed by the spirit and killed the woodcutter, so now you will have to kill him. Examine Jacob's body to complete the quest (150), after which you can find 123 florens beside him.
Important: Taking this path will count as ""Proof of Valor"" for There Can Be Only One.
Pleading or Self-reliance[]
The difference is that handling it on your own may fail, while pleading gives clear instructions on what to do. If you agree to the Witch's terms she will explain that you need Sir Gareth's bone for the ritual to succeed. If you already have it Geralt will mention it and the Witch will praise him for it. Regardless return to the tree and talk to Jacob, he will agree to help with the ritual. Now light up the fires in order and Geralt will throw the kerchief into it, as well as Sir Gareth's bone if you have it.
If you didn't ask what happened to Sir Gareth and/or don't have the bone, Daphne will emerge from the tree as a Wraith and you will have to fight her. If you did everything right, she will appear as a Ghost and ask if Sir Gareth remained faithful to her. Regardless what you answer, she will thank you for your help and leave this world for good.
Whichever the case was, Jacob will pay you the agreed amount of 100+ and the quest completes. (150)

In the south part of the market you'll see several paintings and easels set up with a painter making a remark on Geralt's appearance. Talk to him to learn he wants to use Geralt as a model in a painting. Agree to it and he'll then direct you to meet him around noon near the Beauclair Palace signpost.
He'll only talk to you when the light is right, so talk to him between 10AM to 2PM. He'll suggest riding out to the area, so follow him on Roach while he talks about his cat (named Pierre-Auguste Moustacherois) who paints before eventually dismounting and walking to the spot. However, it appears his paints have disappeared so you'll need to help him find them. There's a clue near the bush (just past the fire) and more going down the path. Follow the scent which will lead you down the hill and into a cave. Kill the nekkers and pick up the paints (100), then head back to the painter.
You have to mount up again and follow him out to the new spot, where you can choose between 3 different poses for the painting (on horseback, standing with a sword, or lying down). Once you pick a pose, he'll start to paint and a few hours will pass.
As he mentions perhaps putting a griffin in the painting, he suddenly spots an actual griffin flying towards you. Defeat it (250) and he'll talk some more before asking if you want to include the griffin in the painting. You can say yes or no (it'll only change how the painting comes out) then he'll pay you 300  and ask you to check in on him back in the market square in a day to see the finished piece. (150)
Note: If you run away from the griffin, the quest will fail and the painter's body can be found at the hill, containing Dye, Parchment and a unique junk item, Bag of weed. The griffin will still be there and would have to be killed first, but no trophy.
Don't forget to loot the griffin's body, it contains a Toussaint Ducal Guardsman's steel sword.
After a full day has passed, head to his spot in the square to see a bit of a crowd around the easel. As they part, you'll see that the painter took some artistic liberty with the painting. You then have the option to buy it for 1000  (yielding 100  through the payments mechanic), but you can opt to delay that decision by saying you don't have the coin right now, and you'll be able to return for it later. Whatever you decide, the quest completes as the conversation ends.

They'll attack as soon as they see you and the quest starts after you kill them. Despite being peasants though, they can be really tough enemies, particularly because of the weapons they use.
Head inside the mill to find footprints, as well as Mill for Sale notes (there's one outside the door, one inside, and a third on the door of the small building opposite). Read one of them, then follow the footprints upstairs to discover a large bloodstain on the top floor and examine it.

This is an umbrella quest, to finish it you have to do 5 other quests at hidden locations, thus you may have already done some or all of them while exploring. In case you have resolved all of them already, you will instantly travel to the Prophet Lebioda Statue site in order to witness the monument, and the foreman will simply give you the reward. Otherwise, this quest will direct you to the individual sub-quests:
Big Feet to Fill: The First Group
Big Feet to Fill: The Second Group (goes differently before this quest is started, details inside)

Big Feet to Fill: The Fifth Group
Each quest you complete will trigger a cutscene where Geralt is transported to a vantage point where the progress on statue is visible, and time will advance to the next day. The statue will grow new sections until it's complete.
You have the option to visit the building site at any point during the quest, although it's best to wait until all 5 groups are found as the foreman will move to the location, so you will have to go there to claim your reward.

Even though you were too late to save this group, the construction of the Prophet Lebioda Statue will move forward like with the other groups and the quest ends.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Cosplay,Secondary_quests,"Heading east, away from Francollarts, you'll pass the Doren Alma Estate where a man, Gaston, is trying to tend to a wounded man on the main road. Respond however you like then, if you wish to investigate, select that option. No matter what you say to Gaston afterwards, he'll go with you to investigate.
Examine the trail, then the spot to the left of the door. You can further examine the door if you wish (it's locked though) all the while with Gaston making small commentary. Blast the door with Aard then head in to find a gruesome scene.
Note: While the door here glows red, it's not breakable with Aard. The reason for this is more to due with it being a clue (which also show as red with Witcher Senses) rather than noting it's a breakable door.
There are a number of things you can examine in the estate:
the burned body right by the door
the overturned tables
the various bodies along the path
the silverware on the small table next to the servant's body
the ceremonial bowls near the red chair
the burn mark near the steps which will have a scent trail you can follow
Follow the scent up the stairs where there's a couple more bodies. However, the real interest is the door at the far end of the trail, from which you will hear loud breathing. Interact with it for a man in hiding, Durand, to appear and who'll explain that some spirits came alive and attacked him and the rest of the group after reenacting a scene from the past. To deal with the problem you must reenact the play with at least 3 individuals. Respond however you wish, but it won't matter, Durand and Gaston will help.
Important: After this happens, time will fast-forward to midnight and you will be locked in with saves and meditation disabled.
You must now play the Aen Seidhe ruler. Once you've regained control, light all 6 torches in the courtyard and Gaston will read the next part/instructions. Grab the elven wine and bread from the chest near the ceremonial bowls and place them on each bowl, then grab the elven shield and sword from near Gaston and equip them. Geralt will have automatically equipped a ceremonial mask as well, but it's not required and may be replaced.
Important: The next step triggers a fight against extremely strong enemies and you will start right in the middle of them, possibly with undesirable gear too. Take your potions and decoctions in advance; any means of increasing your damage resistances are highly recommended. If you're using Protective Coating, put your Hanged Man's Venom on both the ancient elven sword and any that you would replace it with during the fight. Northern Wind is particularly useful to give yourself some breathing room. Oddly, dimeritium bombs have no effect on the elven mages.
Now kneel before Durand and as Durand speaks Ludovic's lines, the statues suddenly come to life. 4 of them will fight with pikes, but the other 2 are mages who strike with fire from a distance. Once they are defeated, Durand explains that the statues once stood in Divethaf's palace and must have been golems meant to come to life during the yearly homage, but didn't have the chance as Divethaf died before the next one.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Father_Knows_Worst,Secondary_quests,"The easiest way to start this quest is to find the contract notice on The Gran'place's notice board, but you may also stumble upon the Albertus Grotto, north of Rioux-Cannes Outpost. Regardless, once you enter the cave two brothers, Lucien Monnart and Auguste Monnart, will be screaming for help and ask Geralt to save their 3rd brother, Hugo Monnart. You can haggle if you wish, then enter the cave after agreeing to help.
Inside, Geralt will be attacked by quite a few Kikimores (many workers and a lone warrior). They can poison in such a way that it rapidly raises Toxicity, preventing you from using potions unless White Honey is used to clear it. Thus, it's a good idea to imbibe your potions before entering the fight. However, this can also be a good thing if you have Euphoria or Toxic Blood. After disposing of them keep moving and you will soon find a sword and a trail of blood, so follow it to find Hugo (don't enter the hot waters you see on the way). He will mistake Geralt for an assassin his brothers hired to kill him. It turns out they wanted to exclude Hugo from the liquor business they were meant to inherit evenly from their father, who split his condenser into 3 parts, 1 per son and this cave is where Hugo's part is located. He will then ask Geralt to search for it and you can agree or refuse.
The missing part[]
Note: If you at any point try to exit the cave and talk to the brothers, Hugo will instead find you at the exit and you'll be missing on this part of the quest and the reward for it.
Go back to the previous cave where a hot water spring is, and Geralt will comment that Quen may protect him, which does indeed work. However, as its duration can run out it's also a good idea to use your Witcher Senses beforehand and find a spot to drop near the red-glowing item. Dive in and get the Still filter.
You can also take a detour to a corridor nearby where you will have to fight more kikimores for access to an Axii Place of power. Nearby is also a female body, on which you can find a letter detailing the story of the missing part.
Regardless, return to Hugo with the filter in hand and he will reward you with 100 . (150)
Important: Finding the filter will count as ""Proof of Honor"" for There Can Be Only One. However, it only seems to work if you find it after talking to Hugo and not before.
Happy Reunion?[]
As you reach the exit, Lucien and Auguste are waiting with some thugs and Hugo will ask Geralt to kill them as they are probably there to kill him.
If you agree, you will have to fight them, though it will be pretty clear something isn't right. After they are dealt with (the two brothers don't actually die), Hugo will thank you, and if asked, says that he'll probably leave the business and Toussaint altogether. (150, but no coin)
Important: Hugo as a merchant will buy anything including decoctions/potions. He will also pay more than any other merchant, although he has only 600 of buying capital. Selling him decoctions is worthwhile for a Metamorphosis build, as you may also buy them back as opposed to just destroying them.
If you say no one dies, it turns out that the thugs are just some hunters who came to help from a nearby camp, and the three brothers will decide to ""bury the hatchet"". If you didn't get the filter, they'll say they found it themselves while Geralt was looking for Hugo. They then pay the agreed amount of coin (300  by default) and invite you to visit them at The Clever Clogs Tavern. (150)

Having the Protection glyphword as your armour enchantment will apply the same automatic, stamina-free, Quen shield to you upon entering combat, therefore gaining a decent advantage during this and any other fistfight. However, all opponents can be easily beaten using a simple pattern: counter their attack, hit two strong attacks, step back, repeat.
For Mancomb, he will do a battle of wits in which Geralt must match his rhymes. Simply pick the rhyming line three times to beat him. However, petty insults also work if you at the end say that he's too dumb to understand them.
For Colossus, he will ask for Geralt to parry him, as nobody has been able to block his punches and will double Geralt's bet if Geralt accepts the challenge to parry him. Simply hit the parry button just as he's about to hit to block him. Once he's been parried three times, Geralt will win the match (extra 100).

Approach him and he'll originally try to send you off, but regardless of how you learned of it, he'll wise up and ask Geralt for his help with a discreet matter. He'll then show you the statue of Reginald d'Aubry which is, for lack of better words, missing its balls/stones. You can then ask some about the situation before he leaves you to investigate.
You can examine the statue then, facing it, go down the left stairs to see something on the trellis at the next flight down, which will make a scent trail appear. There's also a small piece of evidence in the corner from here, next to the potted roses. Follow the scent out the front door. If you're having a hard time seeing it here (like during the day) the trail goes left and up the hill, left towards the market, then west, up the stairs next to the Perfumery, and then stops halfway up at a house, where you can hear some obvious noises.
Enter for a cutscene where Hughes de Saberre is using the stones to satisfy a married woman, Rosalinda, and mistakes you for her husband. Answer however you want before Rosalinda's irate husband shows up, and you'll have to either fistfight him or use Axii (doesn't require Delusion but earns a minimum of 25).
If you fought the husband and lost, you'll be told by Hughes that the husband had destroyed the stones while you were knocked out. Otherwise you'll have 3 further choices on what to do with the stones:
let Hughes keep them
take them back now
lend them for a day
If you let him keep them, he'll give you 50  then tells you to come back in a week and that he'll give you twice as much then. (100) However, a week later, you find Rosalinda crying at his doorstep, and there's a notice on the door saying that he died from overexertion, the stones nowhere to be found. Geralt will comment that at least Hughes died happy.
Important: Letting Hughes keep the stones will count as ""Proof of Compassion"" for There Can Be Only One.
Lending or taking them back right then only differ on how long you must wait to turn in the quest. If you lend them, you'll have to wait 24 hours before returning to Hughes, but either way he gives you back the stones.
Important: Getting the stones back will count as ""Proof of Honor"" for There Can Be Only One.
However it played out, it's time to turn in the quest with art curator. If you don't return the stones, he'll be upset and, feeling that all is lost, obviously doesn't give a reward. If you return the stones, he'll be thrilled and gives you a Reginald figurine, which you can put on display at Corvo Bianco. (100) He also tells you to return tomorrow for the reopening, when he will let you stroke the stones for free. The curator will then go and repair the statue.
Note: If the stones are returned, after a day has passed you can at any time afterwards touch the fig leaf to receive a buff called ""The Power of Reginald"", which grants unlimited stamina while running for an hour of gameplay. If you wish to use this, it's a good idea to put a permanent marker for the statue on your map.

Once you have it you can use the quest to locate the other players from who you can win the remaining cards. Once you obtain all the cards the quest ends.

"https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Gwent:_To_Everything_-_Turn,_Turn,_Tournament!",Secondary_quests,"The quest can be started by finding the posting on any notice board in Toussaint, a pamphlet that can be found in a few places, or directly speaking to the tournament host at The Pheasantry's balcony.
Talk to Martin Monnier who will allow Geralt to take part in the tournament on the condition he plays the Skellige Gwent deck. Agree and he will give you the basic deck, which will start the Gwent: Never Fear, Skellige's Here quest if you don't already have it - that quest will guide you to other players from who you can win the rest of the cards, which you have to do, as you won't be allowed to play until you have a strong enough deck. Once you collect enough cards the quest will update to say that you can enter the tournament.
Note: Even if you have enough Skellige cards to take part in the tournament, it's best to first complete Gwent: Never Fear, Skellige's Here, as then you can be sure you have all the cards you need.
Important: Be sure to play the Innkeep as quickly as you can, as once you have enough cards to enter the tournament, The Pheasantry will be inaccessible, so you will not be able to play her and thus obtain Draig Bon-Dhu until it is over.
Once you are ready go back to Martin Monnier. You may take note of some unhappy dwarves when you reach the place, but don't worry about them right now. Talk to the guard to present your deck and he will let you in. Martin Monnier will ask how you feel about the deck, but regardless of your response he will be certain that you will win and introduces you to the other players, after which the tournament begins.
The Skellige Deck[]
The deck can be best described as ""Jack of All Trades, Master of None"" and relies heavily on luck. It has access to both Muster and Tight Bond cards as well as it's own unique Mardroeme cards, however including Gwent neutral cards it can only have up to 2 medic cards and only 1 spy card. Thus it's difficult to draw the cards you need to use a proper strategy, as it's likely you will end up with an impaired hand.
Kambi is good but can also be disappointing if it gets revived during a 3rd round using the decks special ability. The one exceptionally strong card is Cerys - it uses Muster to call all Shield Maidens, who in turn have Tight Bond, resulting in an instant 46 attack strength. Like every Tight Bond card, it is weak against Scorch effect cards, but don't worry, the developers knew how poor the deck is and made sure the opponents rarely use these effects. There is a relatively consistent strategy to make the deck work:
Decoys are your friend[]
Decoys are the only way to make this deck strong without pure luck, so be sure to equip all 3, as they can be used to reuse your opponents Spy cards. Even if your opponent does not play Nilfgaard or Northern realms, they still allow you reuse the Birna Bran medic card and/or Scorch unit cards like Villentretenmerth and Clan Dimun Pirate.
Play them with Muster cards[]
By selecting Crach an Craite as the leader it is possible to reuse Muster cards in another round by using Decoys. Problem is that the Skellige deck has only access to 1 set of Muster cards which is the Light Longship and Cerys cannot be reused as it's a hero card. However, if you also have Hearts of Stone expansion you can add the Gaunter O'Dimm cards to the deck. Thus you can use the following strategy - after you draw your cards be sure to exchange all duplicate Muster cards for something else like usual. However, if you draw both Gaunter O'Dimm (gwent card) and Gaunter O'Dimm: Darkness (gwent card), then keep both as you can use Gaunter O'Dimm in another round to reuse the Darkness without the help of a Decoy.
When the round starts, play both Light Longship and Gaunter O'Dimm: Darkness. If you also have Olaf and/or Olgierd von Everec you can play them in the ranged row to boost their strength. Now recall 1 Light Longship and Gaunter O'Dimm: Darkness card with your Decoys. In the next round use Crach an Craite to reshuffle your cards and use your Muster cards again. If you used Olgierd or Olaf in the first round you can use a medic to revive them, but be sure to do it BEFORE you reshuffle your deck. A problem is that the card may get revived in the Close combat row, but if you still have a spare Decoy you could use it to change the cards position to the Ranged row.
Even if this strategy does not ensure you a round victory, it will at the very least force your opponent to use up more of his/her cards thus increasing your chance of winning in the 3rd round. Just don't use Crach right before the third round, or you'd be effectively giving up on the deck's global ability. And remember to use your Muster cards before your spy card if you do draw it, else it may draw more of your Muster cards which would be a waste.
The Tournament[]
Losing any of the matches naturally eliminates you from the competition, but you will still be locked into the quest until the entire tournament completes. There are Checkpoint saves to take advantage of, but really only one opportunity to use them without closing the entire game - keep this in mind if you want to win the whole thing.
Important: Winning the tournament will count as ""Proof of Wisdom"" for There Can Be Only One.
Geralt's first opponent is Hamal ogn Dangbahli who plays the Monster deck. He will propose to raise the stakes - gamble your silver sword for a chance to win a steel one from him, which you can refuse if you wish.If you agree but lose, Martin Monnier will buy it back for you, but Hamal's deck is pretty weak and like other NPC players he is likely to play his Kayran (gwent card) in the Ranged row instead of Close Combat row, so he's not much of a challenge.If you agree and win, your reward will be Blave and an extra 100.
A scene then follows and two of the participants are disqualified. Provided that you're still in the tournament, your next opponent will be Ambassador von Hinn. He doesn't have a particularly strong deck, but he does play the Nilfgaardian deck and so it's almost inevitable that he has spy cards, so try to save a Decoy for that.
Win or lose, the protesters you saw earlier at the door barge in and you will have to fight 3 of them in a fistfight. Or rather, you can only use your fists, but all three of them hit you with clubs and you're in a tight space, which makes for a ridiculously hard to survive fight. Luckily you can consume food, drink potions etc, but it still takes a lot of dodging until only one dwarf is left. Ultimately though, losing only gives one red mark in the objectives log and you don't miss out on anything else.
Note: As of Patch 4.0 the Dwarves can now be fought using a sword.
Either way, Geralt has a calm down talk with the dwarves and they turn friendly after he name-drops Zoltan Chivay. It is decided that their leader will enter the final, and if you're still in the tournament, it's time to play Martin Monnier in what is now the ""pre-final"". He also plays the new deck and thus it's a more even match. Winning it puts you into the final against Yaki Rafiberg who has the Scoia'tael deck. The quest completes after the final match.
The reward now depends on how far you progressed:
If you won all matches: 250, 1000  and The Victor's Cup
If lost only against the dwarf: 150, 500  and The Victor's Cup
If you lost any other match: 50 and 100","Meet with the tournament's organizer.
If you don't have a strong enough deck:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Knight_for_Hire,Secondary_quests,"To start the quest, you may pick up the notice from any notice board in Toussaint.
After you find the note go to the The Ducal Camerlengo he will give you directions on where to go, so you can easily find the right locations using quest markers. The quest can be done while exploring as you need to clear 15 Undiscovered locations, which are Persons in Distress, Knight Errants in Distress, Abandoned Sites and Hanse Bases. You probably already know how some of them work, however Hanse Base and Knight Errant in Distress are new.
Knight Errant in Distress works much like Person in Distress only the Knight will be fighting the bandits and can die, however they are very capable of handling things on their own, so it's unlikely they will die even if you just stand and watch.
Hanse Base works much like an Abandoned Site, i.e. after you clear it allied NPC's will inhabit it, however they are much more dangerous. The bandits form pretty much a small army and there is always a weak bandit who will attempt to light a signal fire calling additional reinforcements for aid unless you kill him before he does. There is also a leader who you must kill as a final boss.
Here are all locations that are quest related, at many of which you can find diagrams for relic equipment:
Hanse Base[]
Arthach Palace Ruins lead by Antoine Straggen(Toussaint knight's steel sword and Toussaint Ducal Guard Captain's gauntlets diagrams are found here)
Mont Crane Castle lead by Filibert von Wittan(Toussaint knight's tourney trousers and Toussaint knight's tourney boots diagrams are found here)

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Master_Master_Master_Master!,Secondary_quests,"Talk to Lazare Lafargue, he will immediately propose to Geralt the quest to find diagrams for Grandmaster Armor sets. You can discuss more with him on this matter, but ultimately you'll need to ask about all 5 witchers from the different schools, with each one unlocking their related quest:
Scavenger Hunt: Grandmaster Feline Gear
Scavenger Hunt: Grandmaster Griffin Gear
Scavenger Hunt: Grandmaster Manticore Gear
Scavenger Hunt: Grandmaster Ursine Gear
Scavenger Hunt: Grandmaster Wolven Gear
Once you complete one of them you can return to him to complete the quest and he will award you with 150 and 500 .

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Mutual_of_Beauclair%27s_Wild_Kingdom,Secondary_quests,"Head towards the campsite mentioned in the contract, at the Trading Post northeast of Coronata Vineyard. When you arrive, the place is in complete disarray and there are blood splatters everywhere - no lack of clues to examine, so get to work. Once you examine a few of them, Geralt will conclude that the merchants were attacked by a basilisk, but not any variety that he knows, at which point a man arrives galloping on his horse.
Geralt warns the man of the danger, but it turns out that he is actually looking after the basilisk and is very proud about it. Talk to him a bit more - he'll present himself as Count Borhis di Salvaress and will add a lot of details, but most importantly that the ""Great White Terror"" is a last of its kind Silver Basilisk named Iocaste. However, he doesn't want it killed and refuses to tell you where to find it, so you're back to examining tracks.
Borhis will comment as you examine the clues, even those you already did before his arrival, but there is a new one that allows you to progress - smashed barrels of tannin. You then have a scent to follow into the woods, where it eventually disperses near some blood stains that will lead you to a corpse. Examine the body and pick up a letter from the body if you wish to know more details about the story, but it's not important for the quest to proceed.
While on your way to the body, the scent became perceptible again (although the effect is hard to see in daylight) and eventually leads you near a road along Venin Rocks, where Geralt hears human voices nearby. Approach to meet a group of Crinfrid Reavers preparing to take on Iocaste. Regardless of what you say, one of them will recognize you and they'll be glad to
share the bounty on the basilisk with you. However, Count di Salvaress appears again and promises to match the fee himself in exchange for letting Iocaste live. The reavers only care about the gold and don't mind either way, so it's your call and you have a timed choice to make.
Spare Iocaste[]
Important: This choice will count as ""Proof of Compassion"" for There Can Be Only One.
If you decide to spare the basilisk, the Count pays the promised bribe and you get your share of 350 . (200) The reavers leave happy, while Borhis offers you an extra reward, which you can accept (50  + 50) or decline. The quest completes and the Count remains hopeful that Iocaste may produce crossbreed offspring yet.
Important: Declining the extra coin will count as ""Proof of Generosity"" for There Can Be Only One.
Kill Iocaste[]
Important: This choice will count as ""Proof of Valor"" for There Can Be Only One.
If you want to kill the basilisk, the reavers will ask whether you want them to help from range with their crossbows or use their weapons up close. It being an aerial creature, the crossbows choice is probably the more convenient one, but regardless of your choice some time passes and combat begins. If you didn't examine enough clues before, you may lack some of this in the bestiary - Iocaste is weak to Draconid oil, Aard, Igni and Golden Oriole, which protects you from her venom.
After she is dead, the reavers are very glad to have had your help and reward you with 400  as the quest completes. (200) The Count is heartbroken, but you get to loot the corpse for Silver basilisk trophy and Squire's steel sword.","Meet the merchants at the camp.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Of_Sheers_and_a_Witcher_I_Sing,Secondary_quests,"South of the Nilfgaardian Embassy you will find Adrien de Rouleau a.k.a. Le Papillon. He wishes to create a ballad about Geralt and has a task for him from which he will get his inspiration. Jean-Louis Ludovic, a local barber, has gone missing and Geralt would be the one to find him. Now you can haggle the price, but either way the pay will be much lower than most contracts.
Once you've settled on a price, you'll need to break the door down with Aard. Downstairs, you can examine empty jars of pomade, and find an advertising leaflet. Go upstairs, where you can find the documents letter from Edgard Lavalliere and hair balsam formula. Examining Jean-Louis's ledger will lead Geralt to conclude that Jean-Louis went out of town to find ingredients for his pomade. Geralt will also find Jean-Louis's map, which Le Papillon will know where it leads, so follow him.
At the first location, you will be attacked by an archespore; kill it then move to the next. At the next location you will find a basket, which Le Papillon will recognize as Jean-Louis's, as well as footprints. Follow the footprints to a cave entrance. Inside the cave, you will find a knight called Beau Duvall and his squires beating up Jean-Louis. Beau blames Jean-Louis for giving him a disastrous haircut which caused him so much shame that he pulled out of the tourney.
You will have 2 ways to respond to Beau's complaints. If you pick the first option, in which Geralt comments that beating up a hairdresser is not very chivalrous, Beau will challenge Geralt to a duel. After you beat him, his squires will drag a wounded Beau away. If you pick the second option where Geralt comments that hair grows back, Beau and his squires will fight Geralt, and Geralt will have to kill them all. Whichever option you chose, Le Papillon will stand back and perform his ballad. As it turns out he doesn't have the money to pay Geralt, but Jean-Louis will pay Geralt 150 for the rescue. The quest then ends.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Paperchase,Secondary_quests,"To start the quest, you should find a vineyard owner near Trentin's workshop (to the west of Lazare Lafargue's workshop) who calls out to Geralt. Talk to him to learn he meant to repay you from years ago but you left before he could, so he opened an account in Geralt's name at the Cianfanelli Bank for the day the witcher would re-appear. So, head over to the bank to collect your money, with interest.
If it's too late in the day (or too early) the bank is closed. The earliest it opens is at 8am, so you'll have to wait until then or, if in the middle of the day, head straight in. Talk to the teller but after a moment she'll inform you there's an error that states you're dead and to fix it you'll need to get a particular form, Permit A38. So, head over to Window 1, which is behind the door near the main bank doors and ask for the permit. Answer however you wish and she'll direct you to two possible locations: the records or archives. The correct one is records, which is upstairs, though you can go check out the archives (who'll be insulted if you try to bribe him). As you may notice, there's a line outside the records room, but nobody is going in so just cut in front, much to the others' displeasure.
Talk with the man, but he asks if you have Form 202 to get permit A38. Choose whichever response suits you, before going back to Window 1. However, right outside the room, the man you cut in front of confronts you. No matter the answer, you'll be told to take the fight outside. Fistfight him (100 if you win), then head back into the bank to talk to the woman at Window 1 except, she's not there. Examine it to pick up a scent that trails off to where the main tellers are. Approach the middle window and try to talk only to be told to go away and wait. So, go sit down beside the bank customer on the bench, who'll talk to you for a bit and offer to play some gwent, which you can choose to partake in or not (50 if you play and win). Either way, he gives you a pretty simple tip: be nice and, if you really want to make her day, give her flowers or perfume. However, all the options give 50 and move you forward to accessing your account (200).
Talk to her again and, after your choice, she'll bring out Giacomo Cianfanelli, who tries to get out of showing you to your deposit until Geralt shows him Anna Henrietta's summons. He'll then lead you down to where all the safe deposits are and instructs you which one yours is. However, on opening it you realize the problem and Giacomo locks the door before you can get to him with the guards in the way. You can either give him a week or try to get your money back now.
If you try to take back your coin now, you must fight the guards and once knocked out, loot the massive key off them to open the vault and confront Giacomo upstairs, who hands over 200 . However, you're no longer allowed to convert coins at the bank. The outcome is the same as well if you get knocked out, though an extra scene is shown with the witcher being thrown out of the bank.

Once at Corvo Bianco, speak with Marlene. She's feeling better now, but all of her family has long since passed away and she's got nowhere to go. This will then give two options, allowing you to decide where she goes. You can either suggest that she return to the city and start a new life, which would end the quest here, or tell her that she can stay at Corvo Bianco.
Important: allowing Marlene to stay with you counts as ""Proof of Compassion"" for There Can Be Only One.
If Geralt allowed Marlene to stay, she will be delighted and says that he will always have a hot meal whenever he returns home, but more importantly, also tells him of a dowry her father had once collected for her. Since she never married, she no longer has a use for it and suggests Geralt should take it for himself. The quest will then take you back to Trastamara Estate Ruins to collect the Dowry. On your way there, you can just fast-travel to Trastamara Estate Ruins signpost, where you shouldn't encounter any enemies on your walk up to the estate.
Marlene's dowry is in the lower room, the one with the entire floor covered in spoons and barrels lining the walls.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Warble_of_a_Smitten_Knight,Secondary_quests,"The quest is started after defeating the Shaelmaar during The Beast of Toussaint. A fair few events will follow that battle and so it can be easy to miss in the moment, but it is present in the quest log just after that, directing you to the Tourney Grounds medic's tent, where Guillaume de Launfal will be waiting for Geralt.
Guillaume will ask Geralt to help lift a curse off Vivienne de Tabris. She will be the host of the Knight tournament, which Guillaume wished to take part in but can't due to his injury. Geralt will have to take his place so that he can stay close to Vivienne and investigate. Now haggle the price if you wish and agree to help, after that Guillaume will explain the competitions to Geralt and you will have the option to practice first or not. You should at least take practice for the race as it's not like the other races you may have done, as Guillaume points out.
Enlisting[]
Having practiced or not, Geralt has to officially register for the tournament. Find the scribe, who is well informed and knows Geralt has two knight titles. You can take part in the tournament as ""Geralt of Rivia"" or as ""Ravix of Fourhorn."" This choice will change the labelling and coat of arms on customized reward items you receive, but the only practical difference is an event where Geralt will get challenged by one of two knights and, as Geralt you would have a mounted combat duel, while as Ravix you would have a fistfight. However, picking ""Geralt of Rivia"" also unlocks an option to gain ""Proof of Honor"" for There Can Be Only One depending on another choice, but there are other alternatives for that. After that you can make an oath for the competition, but that only alters some announcements by Le Papillon at the end of the tournament.
When done, you'll receive a souvenir shield and be equipped with customized armor. This equipment does not have to be used during the tournament and can be replaced and even sold right away. You can also loot a note from the desk, then proceed with the tournament.
Shooting range[]
At the shooting range you will again meet Palmerin de Launfal, who will offer to swap places with you if you beat him at Gwent, explaining that Geralt will have the sun in his eyes which may hinder his performance. You can play for fun, but obviously the sun makes no difference to a witcher, and oddly it doesn't change who you compete against either.
To win the competition you have to shoot all the red targets before your opponent shoots all of the blue ones. If you win, you'll be awarded 100 and a customized crossbow by Vivienne. Geralt will notice his medallion is reacting while she is near him, but she explains that's due to her perfume made by a sorceress. This conversation doesn't occur if you lose though.
Vivienne's tent[]
Win or lose, Guillaume will then propose to search for clues in Vivienne's tent while he acts as the lookout, and you'll also have the option to pause the quest here if you wish. Inside the tent you can find some notes and inspect a few things, but the search will be interrupted before you can examine everything. This doesn't affect anything except some minor remarks though, namely if you examine both the claw marks and oriole feather, Geralt will suspect that Vivienne may be a bruxa. When all but the last clue are examined, Guillaume will tell Geralt someone is coming and a lady will shoo you away from the tent. Go to the next competition then.
Note: It's actually possible to examine all clues by quickly interacting with the last one while Geralt is still commenting, but doing so doesn't seem to change anything.
The race[]
Approach the racing area to trigger a cutscene, and at its end you will meet a new ""friend"". If you entered as Geralt of Rivia, Prince Anséis of Lyria and Rivia will recognize Geralt and be angry for past events from Baptism of Fire. If you entered as Ravix of Fourhorn, instead Arthur Tailles will be angry with Geralt for an encounter during The Last Wish, though you may also remember him from The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings prologue.
As during the training, the race is time-based and you have no opponents, but your time is constantly running out and you have to finish before it depletes. You will have dummies to hit with your sword along the way and targets to shoot with your crossbow. Every time you hit a dummy and shoot a target you are given additional time. If you hold your attack button time will slow down thus it will be more easy to hit the dummies. Same goes for holding the crossbow button, though for some reason Roach can slow down her gallop while shooting. The dummies can also be shot with the crossbow and auto-aim works for them.
Note: do not use explosive crossbow bolts, as it will be considered cheating just like leaving the track and/or missing checkpoints.
If you win, you'll be awarded 100 and customized saddle by Vivienne, who this time comments on someone being noticed snooping around her tent and doesn't buy Geralt's excuse. This conversation doesn't occur if you lost, though she'll still deliver a veiled remark for Geralt publicly. The day will then end and you'll automatically advance to the next section.
Confrontations[]
Guillaume will now take Geralt for a drink and he will explain his findings. Now your new ""friend"" will interrupt them and, if it's Arthur Tailles, he will pull you into a fistfight with 2 other thugs he brought, but you'll have Guillaume at your side. If it's Prince Anséis, he will challenge Geralt to a mounted duel. You can attempt to refuse but Guillaume will tell you it is dishonorable to refuse the challenge and you would thus be thrown out of the tourney, forcing you to do the duel anyway. So you may as well agree.
Important: If you agree to the duel and win, it will count as ""Proof of Honor"" for There Can Be Only One.
After that Vivienne will head out into the woods and Guillaume will ask Geralt to follow her. However, after reaching her tent you will not find her there and instead see an Oriole bird flying off, apparently showing Geralt where to go, so follow it. While following the bird, it will stop at times where you will encounter panthers, but you can just run past them to the bird and make it continue its flight. Eventually, it will fly over a hill and Geralt will comment that it's probably easier to go through the cave passage under it. You can go over or around it, or going through the cave as intended you will encounter a Wight and Barghest. The bird will be waiting at the other exit, where you continue to follow it. Soon you will find Vivienne who turns out is indeed cursed and appears like a half-human half-bird hybrid. (50) She is expecting Geralt to kill her and asks to make it quick. However, Geralt obviously has no such plans and tells her that he can try to remove the curse in 2 ways: move the curse from her to someone else which will make it much weaker on the recipient, or use the egg of an oriole, but possibly shortening her life to that of an Oriole, which is around 7 years. Vivienne doesn't hesitate to choose the second method, but Geralt will tell her to think about it first. After this, you can return immediately with her, or stay there and return later to Guillaume when convenient for you.
Note: If you wish to win the tournament and need to make adjustments to your equipment, it's better to stay at the clearing here. Otherwise, you won't have access to inventory until after the tournament, and unfortunately all temporary buffs except blade oils are lost at the start of the next challenge.
Upon returning to Guillaume, he will wish to know what Geralt has found out and you have an important choice:
keep Vivienne's secret, and you will only be able to use the oriole egg method
reveal her secret, and Guillaume will volunteer to reflect the curse upon himself
Note that the choice you make here is final and will determine what happens, even though Vivienne technically hasn't decided yet. There will be a morally righteous spin put on whatever choice you wish to make, but the long-term consequences are significant for both Guillaume and Vivienne. See the consequences section if you don't like surprises.
Important: Refusing to reveal the secret will count as ""Proof of Honor"" for There Can Be Only One.
When done conversing about Vivienne, as you no longer need the tournament to remain around her, you can choose to continue your participation or not, though you will be missing on possible further rewards if the latter is chosen.
Important: Remaining in the tournament and winning it will count as ""Proof of Valor"" for There Can Be Only One.
The battle[]
If you remained in the tournament you will be taking part in a re-creation of a battle along with your team and the last man or men standing wins. It's a 5 vs 5 fight, but not as easy as you may think, as your team members have a good chance of going down and leave everything in your hands, so dispose of as many opponents as you can while opponents are engaged in battle with your teammates, before they all go down. Even worse Signs and Bombs are disabled, inventory will be inaccessible, and you may only use potions if they are in your quick slots. Undying will also not help, thus even though you may feel confident for this part it may prove very difficult, especially on higher difficulty settings. This is one of the battles where Gourmet can prove to be invaluable.
If you win the battle, you'll be awarded 100. Then, if you also won the shooting and race competitions, you will now be facing Gregoire de Gorgon, the previous tournament's winner.
Note: At the start of this one-on-one battle, you have a small period during which you can save to avoid having to reload.
He does not block much but his attacks are strong and unblockable. He will also use a very strong attack sometimes where he will hit the ground real hard leaving him vulnerable. A good hint is to hit him with a strong attack and them jump away, strong attack, then jump away, and you'll manage to win with no problem. An Iris charged strong attack can one shot him. All restrictions from the mock battle still apply though. Losing this battle is treated as death, so you have to win, and are then awarded 250, a customized sword, and the Tourney champion's laurels.
Lifting the curse[]
Whether you completed the tournament or not, Geralt will now be at Vivienne's tent and it's time to lift her curse, though you will have the option to pause here and return later. As you talk to her, Guillaume will appear and interject, wanting to help even if you didn't reveal Vivienne's secret to him. However, even though questions are asked and Geralt can give his opinion on the best route, your choice is already set and this is only where it plays out. If you revealed the secret, Guillaume will convince Vivienne to attempt transferring the curse onto him, and you will go with both of them to the lake to do so. Otherwise, she will banish him and you will go with only Vivienne to perform the egg ritual.
Regardless, as you reach the clearing you will have to kill a panther before you can perform the ritual. The curse will be lifted either way and only the scene will differ. If you used the egg, Vivienne will decide to live her 7 years to the fullest by travelling around the world, and you will have to return to the unhappy Guillaume for your reward. If you transferred the curse, Geralt will remark that he didn't think it would work, because of a yet unmentioned stipulation - true love between the people involved - and they will become a couple.
The quest then completes with Guillaume paying the reward. (250)","Visit Guillaume in the medics' camp.

Stone Inscriptions[]
No man can be called good who does not share his prosperity with others. Generosity is required for dignity in life and peace in death.
Valor does not make one good, yet how many good men have you met in your life's journey who were cowards? Those who posses valor do not hesitate to stand against the majority, no matter what the consequences.
There are many traits that bear witness to a man's true nature. Compassion is what separates men from beasts. Whoever feels sympathy for his fellow man will never turn a blind eye to misfortune. He will always stand in defense of the wronged.
Honor cannot be purchased. Honor also cannot be sold, for its value is greater than all the treasure in the world. Yet one can lose it, and whoever does so shall have sullied his name for all eternity. A truly honorable man always stands behind his actions, faces every challenge and refuses to lie.
Wisdom is a virtue which one should strive to cultivate throughout one's life, for it is impossible to be so wise one cannot become even wiser. The wise know this... As we journey through life, we should seek to make wise choices. Remember, wise choices are not those which make our lives easier or simpler. Often, they make them more complicated. But always, they make us better.","Investigate the isle on Lac Célavy.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Till_Death_Do_You_Part,Secondary_quests,"The quest may be started by finding its notice on The Gran'place's notice board, speaking directly to Charles Lanzano at The Clever Clogs Tavern, or hearing noises at the Temple Cemetery at night.
If Lanzano is talked to before going to the cemetery, he will explain that noises from the cemetery prevent him from sleeping and he can be haggled with, but it's a very cheap contract and only a couple extra crowns can be negotiated.
At the cemetery, different things will happen depending on the time. During daylight, you will have a search area and multiple clues to examine, but Geralt will eventually conclude that none of them lead to the culprit and he has to wait until dark. If you arrived at night time, Geralt will remark that it is indeed ""noisy"" at the cemetery, but the noises soon disappear.
Either way, the noises will appear again (only during the night) and this time it's clear they come from the catacombs. If you use your Witcher Senses, the source of the sound waves will be quite obvious, but otherwise you may encounter two separate groups of grave robbers, one of which is part of the treasure hunt quest The Last Exploits of Selina's Gang and killing them may start it. However, Geralt will remark that they are not the cause.
Once you reach the correct room (immediately left from the catacombs entrance), Geralt will remark on how strange it is that no one is there. You can use your witcher senses to examine a few things, one of which is a real clue, though it doesn't matter and Geralt will decide that it must not be the right place. However, as soon as he leaves the noises will start again, and clearly coming from that same room. Yet, inside it's still empty and Geralt will decide it's best to hide somewhere to find out what is happening. Look for a spot behind the statue to interact with and Geralt will wait there.
Soon two spirits will appear and bicker like an old married couple, which in fact they were. The spirits in question are Louis de Corentin an addicted gambler, and Margot de Corentin a devotee of Lebioda. Geralt will have to pick one of their urns to move, but they both seem to have a legitimate claim to the crypt and both promise some hidden Gwent cards as a reward. Although you can't know that yet, one of them is lying and will offer a different reward afterwards, so read below first if you want to make your choice based on that.
Side with Margot[]
Pick up Louis' urn and he will ask Geralt to place it in the private chambers of the ""Gwent Friendship Society."" The place is in the same catacombs nearby and you will encounter some grave robbers there, if you haven't been there yet. After disposing of them, place the urn on the altar where you'll also find the unique Ode to Gwent book. Then go back to Margot and she will tell you she hid the cards at the couple's home. Once you reach the house with the ""tree sign"" Geralt will remark that something isn't right as his medalion is reacting. Everything is locked though and you have to find a place to climb over and in - there are two of them, easy enough to find. Inside you will encounter an Archespore and after it's dead, check under the roses to find the cards.
However, the cards you receive are Barclay Els and Vampire: Bruxa, neither of which is possible to obtain more than once. Thus, if you already have them, you will receive nothing despite Geralt's satisfied comments. Loot the nearby chest for the garden key to let yourself out without climbing again.
Side with Louis[]
Pick up Margot's urn and she will ask Geralt to lay her remains at the grave of her mother, Michel'ine Belrose. Go to the Orlémurs Cemetery and find her grave near the tree Margot mentioned, in the southernmost corner. Place the urn there and return to Louis for your reward. However, he is nowhere to be found so Geralt decides to force him to appear, so you have to pick up his urn. Louis will appear and admit he doesn't know where the cards are, but will offer Geralt a sword that he won on a Gwent game from Trentin, but never got to pick up. As he explains, Trentin is also an addicted Gwent player and his wife would not be pleased if she heard he started again.
Find Trentin at his workshop and after a bit of ""persuasion"" he will give you the Forged in Fire sword (75) and asks for a chance to get even by playing Gwent. You can agree or refuse to this, and only the journal entry will be different. The sword isn't on the line, only coin is, though if you're a Gwent addict yourself, this is your only chance to play Trentin.
Return to Lanzano[]
Regardless of who you helped, return to Charles for your reward. You will have two options now:
tell the truth and you'll receive 100 and 50  (or the haggled amount)
say it was a difficult task and you'll only receive 50, but double the coin
Important: If you tell the truth it will count as ""Proof of Honor"" for There Can Be Only One.
The quest completes as soon as rewards from both Charles Lanzano and the chosen de Corentin spouse are collected.","Find Charles Lanzano at the Clever Clogs.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Turn_and_Face_the_Strange,Secondary_quests,"Right after the main quest Blood Run ends you will very likely run into a boy who will deliver a letter for Geralt. It can be from Triss only if you romanced her, otherwise it's always from Yennefer, but it's different depending on whether you romanced her or not. Now you will have the option to tip the boy with 5 or not.
Important: If you tip the boy it will count as ""Proof of Generosity"" for There Can Be Only One.
Go to Orlémurs Cemetery near Lebioda's Gate. The grave you are looking for is just west from the fast travel point; however, someone has robbed the grave, so investigate with your Witcher Senses to find footprints and follow them. The trail ends abruptly with no way to continue the search so you must open your inventory and use the old map of Toussaint which will tell you where to go next. (50) Go to the new location and dive underwater. You will find a portal there, so enter it, and you will appear in the ruins. (50)
Soon you will find spike traps, but you don't need to cross them unless you want some loot. Instead, start climbing down. Along the way some panther statues will come to life and attack; note that these are specters and not real beasts. Kill them (100) and keep going. You will run into evidence that the grave robber was there too, and you may also find remains of Professor Moreau's diary. After encountering another guardian, eventually you will reach a closed door, and to open it, you will have to shoot blocks on walls with your crossbow.
Inside you will find a pedestal and gargoyle statues. When you examine one, it will come to life, and you will have to fight it. After it's defeated (100), it will drop a hand which you have to place on a pedestal. Portals will open, and you have to enter the correct ones. You just have to notice which direction the statue at the center is looking, but if you're having trouble—take the left one, then climb down and climb up to the portal on the opposite side, enter it, then keep moving left until you see a gap. Jump over it and enter the portal you find there. This will take you to the lab. (100)
The laboratory[]
Search the lab and you will find a megascope, but you don't have to use it yet. Search the place to find two megascope crystals: one is on the desk with a book on it, and the other on a bench behind the machine that looks like an iron maiden. Go back to the megascope and use the pillow nearby that has crystals on it and place the remaining two. This gives you the optional objective of checking the additional recordings. There are a few other unimportant things to inspect, but a library shelf will give another book when examined.
Activate the megascope and listen to what Tomas Moreau has been up to. As it turns out, he tried to ""cure"" the mutations of a witcher to turn his son back to normal, but he only strengthened them. To perform the process, giant centipede eggs are required. If you find the extra crystals, you will get 100 for looking at them and an additional 100 if you found them before using the megascope for the first time.
You now have to search for the eggs; they are in a nearby cave, which you can enter through a hole in one of the cages. You will have to fight Pale Widows though, but you can entangle them with Yrden to make them defenseless. After you reach the nest, take the mutated giant centipede albumen out of one of the little mounds of eggs (100 if done after looking at the crystals). Only one dose is needed. If you take the other corridor, you will reach an Aard-breakable wall to drop back in the lab, but you can also return the way you came. Place the albumen in the machine that looks like an iron maiden, strip, and then activate it. With this, mutations have been unlocked.
Note: when playing on New Game + where mutations were previously unlocked, the process will instead award an additional skill point.
Now go to the new marker and activate the crystal with Aard to open the portal, enter, and it will teleport you to the lake where the entrance portal was to end the quest. (200)","Search for Moreau's grave at Orlémurs Cemetery using your Witcher Senses.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Wine_Wars:_Belgaard,Secondary_quests,"The quest can be started by picking up a notice from pretty much any notice board in Toussaint, or simply meeting the people at its starting point.
First Part[]
For the first part of the quest, simply make your way to Plegmund's Bridge, where Liam and Matilda are arguing over who gets to buy Belgaard Vineyard. Once you approach them, it'll automatically go into a small cutscene before Liam asks you to help him out. If agreed to, he will then give the quest Wine Wars: Coronata. Afterwards, Matilda gets your attention and asks you to help her out as well. If you agree to help her, she'll give Wine Wars: Vermentino. They will accuse each other of sabotage, but that won't prevent Geralt from helping both.
After the conversations with Liam and Matilda, this quest will complete. It however will come back again later with additional objectives.
Note that a number of quests and paths will open up based on what actions are taken that will decide who becomes Belgaard's new owner for the second part of the quest:
Only help one of the vineyards and turn in before completing the other's: the owner that was helped and turned in (Liam or Matilda) will become Belgaard's new, sole owner. Completing the other's tasks after this will not allow them to join forces nor help end their feud.
Help both vineyards but didn't investigate the sabotage prior to turning both in: both Liam and Matilda will begrudgingly enter a partnership to run Belgaard together. Note you can still do Wine Wars: The Deus in the Machina after this point but won't learn the truth to end their feud.
Help both vineyards and completed Wine Wars: The Deus in the Machina before turning in their quests: Liam and Matilda will gladly enter a partnership to run Belgaard together. If not all tasks have been done yet, their tasks will combine into Wine Wars: Consorting but it's effectively the same as their separate quests.
Second Part[]
Regardless if you did Wine Wars: The Deus in the Machina and who you helped (or didn't), you'll be asked if you can help out further with Belgaard. If you agree, 5 more tasks are given.
Vineyard infestation northeast of Belgaard Manor
An endrega warrior, drone and two workers have infested this part. Take them out and destroy the nest for 20. You can also loot Thierry Pires' journal from the nearby body if you wish, though it's not needed for anything.
Guarded treasure west of Gélenser Farm
Kill the two giant centipedes and loot the body for the letter to Gregory Pyxide.
Person(s) in distress on the beach north-northeast of Termes Palace Ruins
Five bandits have captured Belgaard's blacksmith. When the bandits are disposed of, he will give you the option to go back to Belgaard with him, but you can stay with no repercussions.
Monster nest northeast of Tesham Mutna Ruins, southeast of Francollarts
Kill the two giant centipedes and destroy their nest. There's a body nearby with a List bearing Belgaard's seal.
Abandoned site at Tilly Field, southeast of Hortense Vineyard
A lone slyzard is here. Once it's dead, time will pass like a normal abandoned site, but there's no  for liberating it. Afterwards, you can loot one of the bodies in the cart for a letter bearing Castel Ravello's seal.
Once done, make your way back to Belgaard Vineyard to turn in the quest for 150 and the promised payment. If you ended Liam and Matilda's feud, they will ask for you to visit later as they have a surprise for you. If so, return in 3 days and they'll reveal they've created a new wine and want you to have the honor of naming it. You can choose between Geralt of Rivia, White Wolf, or Butcher of Blaviken.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Wine_Wars:_Coronata,Secondary_quests,"This quest is given if Geralt agrees to help out Liam right after the first part of Wine Wars: Belgaard, where he sees Liam and his competitor, Matilda, arguing over who gets Belgaard. After agreeing to help Liam, you're given 5 tasks to complete:
Vineyard infestation north of Coronata
Nearest one to the starting point. Kill the two archespores here, then destroy the nest (100) to finish the task.
Guarded treasure northeast of Coronata Vineyard
Two more archespores need to be killed here. Once they're dead, examine the bodies, one of which has Orders on elegant stationery. Read it to see someone is trying to sabotage Liam's vineyard. This will also open the option to investigate Vermentino for answers, and is a requirement for starting Wine Wars: The Deus in the Machina.
Abandoned site at Forest Herbarium, southeast of Coronata
A lone archespore will be here. When it's killed, Geralt will automatically meditate and time will pass (like for every abandoned site, except no  is earned here). Afterwards, you can head over to the cart of dead bodies to find a note by Liam.
Hidden treasure at Pittapatte River Crossing, north of Dun Tynne Crossroads
Here, two rabid rock trolls need to be killed. When safe, you can also loot the nearby corpse for a letter, which starts the Coin Doesn't Stink treasure hunt quest.
Person(s) in distress in a cave north-northeast of the Trading Post
There are 2 different entrances, so take whichever one and you'll soon have to fight 3 bandits who have captured Liam's herbalist. After dealing with them, the herbalist will ask if you want to escort her back to the vineyard, but you can choose to stay with no repercussions. If you do stay, you can loot the area, including one of the bodies to find a dirtied letter.
After completing all 5 tasks, you can either head right back to Plegmund's Bridge or, if you read the orders on elegant stationery and haven't done Matilda's quest, go do Wine Wars: Vermentino. Note that if you don't complete Matilda's tasks before turning in Liam's, you can still collect a reward from her after finishing, but the order of things you decide to do here will determine who acquires Belgaard, as well as the outcome of Wine Wars: Belgaard's second part.
The payment and 100 can be received at different points, also depending on the order of tasks completion:
if Wine Wars: The Deus in the Machina was completed before both Liam and Matilda's quests and there are still tasks remaining for either, the reward will become part of Wine Wars: Consorting instead
if Matilda's quest was completed first, you will get the reward for this one as soon as you return to Liam
in any other case, it is received after the first talk at Belgaard Manor later","Deal with all the problems at the Coronata Vineyard. 0/5
[Optional] Read the note you found at Coronata.
If Geralt read the note:
[Optional] Search Vermentino and find proof of sabotage.
Mutually exclusive depending of whether Geralt investigated Vermentino:
Inform Liam that you've resolved all his problems and help him take control of Belgaard.
Without investigating Vermentino's problems, let Liam take over Belgaard, or continue investigating and deal with Matilda's problems."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Wine_Wars:_The_Deus_in_the_Machina,Secondary_quests,"After agreeing to help both Liam and Matilda, they will give Wine Wars: Coronata and Wine Wars: Vermentino, respectively. While each one has five tasks, there's only one location at each you need to visit to start this one. Both locations are guarded treasures where you have to defeat two archespores (in each place) and then examine the bodies there (the order doesn't matter):
For Coronata, it is northeast of Coronata Vineyard and south of the Trading Post. On the body there you'll find orders on elegant stationery.
For Vermentino, it is northeast of the Sansretour valley signpost, and on the body you'll find a letter on elegant stationary and a heavy brass key.
In doing these, Geralt learns that someone is sabotaging both vineyards and to learn more can head to the Abandoned Storehouse far south, to the east of Tesham Mutna Ruins. Once there, enter the underground cellar (just in front of the main building on a lower plane—it can be confusing as the objective marker covers the above-ground building, too) and in the small room ahead an archespore will attack that has to be defeated. When done, you have to use your Witcher Senses to find the next clue, but this is where the path splits depending on circumstances.
If Belgaard already has a new owner[]
In the storehouse, examine the dead body to find a fragment of a letter. However, there's no incriminating evidence by this point to figure out who was really behind the sabotage and so it remains unsolved. In this case, the quest ends with no rewards.
If Belgaard's fate is still undecided[]
If neither of the Coronata or Vermentino quests have been completed, in a crate there you will find a stocktaking report, revealing that the Beast of Beauclair's first victim, Count Vladimir Crespi, was the mastermind behind the conspiracy. You'll also see seedlings here that can be examined, upon which Geralt will remark that he should destroy them. You can choose to do this with Igni and doing so awards 100. If you don't destroy them and later return after completing the quest, another archespore will have hatched and will attack.
It is then time to return to Liam and Matilda at the Toussaint Office of Internal Revenue near Plegmund's Bridge. Revealing the real saboteur, Liam and Matilda will bury the hatchet and gladly join forces to run Belgaard together. You will receive 250 here for solving the mystery and ending their feud. What happens next depends on what's been completed in the Wine Wars so far:
If all tasks for both vineyards have been done already: the second part of Wine Wars: Belgaard will start, and you will receive the rewards from both when you talk to them at Belgaard Manor.
If any task for either vineyard remains: Wine Wars: Consorting will start and you'll have to wait for both rewards until after that quest completes.","Find the place mentioned in the letter.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Game_Hunter,Contracts,"This quest is usually started by picking up Wanted: The White Wolf at pretty much any notice board in Toussaint, but you can also directly find the employer Count Beledal near Chuchote Cave.
Talk to him and he will explain that he wishes to ""preserve"" (pictures of) interesting wildlife for his daughter, Clarissa, and needs your escort for that. You can haggle for your reward and, being a wealthy man, he will agree to pay any amount you request. After agreeing to help, he will give you a map which you have to read in order to learn the general locations of creatures he is interested in.
Note: The quest cannot be done when it's dark so you will have to meditate till morning if it's late. In fact, if started in the late afternoon, time will at some point change to an earlier hour. As you have to protect the count during his endeavour, fast travelling will also be disabled for the duration of the quest.
After reading the map, you have 3 marked locations to explore. The nearest is an area where you have to look for panthers, and at the other two you have to track giant centipedes. The order doesn't really matter, so just head to the first one.
Finding the Panthers[]
If you came here first, you will see a Bear but the Count doesn't want you to attack it, so keep your distance (just stay on the hill) to avoid fighting it. Simply moving on to the next location will make it go away on its own. If you get too close to the bear, you will have to fight it.
2 smaller markers will appear on your map, and in the next area will only have some deer running around, although it's easy to skip this one even by accident. At the second spot you will find a panther and her cub nearby. The mother is caught in a bear trap and you have to free it by opening the trap, however before you do, use Axii on her else you will be forced to fight it.
Giant centipede nest[]
You have 2 areas that you can search for the giant centipedes. For the purposes of the quest, it doesn't matter which one you pick, but going for the northern one may get you dangerously close to wraiths associated with other quests. Use your Witcher Senses to hear the sound of the centipede's burrowing and follow it. Once you find the nests, you will have to find a safe vantage point for the Count. There are 3 positions to choose from, however only the southern one will be appropriate. After you select the correct one, you will have to lure the giant centipede using noise. You can use Aard or a bomb on the nests to lure them out.
Do not attack the centipedes that appear as the count doesn't want you to hurt the creatures and you will fail a mission objective for this. If you're down below you can run around to evade the centipedes, but the safest way is to just throw a bomb from the vantage point previously selected and stay there. Eventually, they will disappear on their own.
Note: These nests don't give  when destroyed and cannot be looted afterwards.
Finding the Peacocks[]
As the last task, the count will ask you to find peacocks for him to get a glimpse of their mating rituals as they are adored by his daughter. Geralt will point out the mating rituals ended a month ago and they are unlikely to spread their tails, but Beledal will suggest that Geralt uses his magic to make them do it, which he will agree to try. There will be three locations for you to investigate, and each with an Odorous peacock feather to examine (any one of them will work). Once you find a feather, you can follow the scent trail using your witcher senses or you can just follow the sound of their cries to find them. The count will say he needs to find a good place to record and will run up to a safe place. He will then request you get the tails to spread and you have to use Axii on three peacocks, so the count can ""preserve"" them. The birds will run away when you try to get close to them and selecting them as targets is tricky; try to stand in one place, they can be selected from a fair distance.
As the count captures the shot however, it turns out that a giant centipede has followed you from the nest and attacks. Kill the centipede and after a short talk you will automatically return back to the camp where Count Beledal's men will reveal that his daughter is disabled, which is why he is travelling the world to collect images for her. The count will pay Geralt and ask if he will show up tomorrow for the exhibit, which you can accept or decline. (150)
If you decline, the quest completes on the spot, but the count tells you to come back to him if you change your mind. He will stay at the camp, but you can only talk to him during the day. If you do, you will be instantly transported to his exhibit at The Scarlet Cardinal Inn, and the rest proceeds as if you agreed initially and went to talk to him there. The quest doesn't resume and you don't receive new objectives, but you still receive rewards.
While still at the camp, you may find Accounts ledger and Letter from the hunter, but they have no effect on the quest.
The Exhibit[]
If you agreed to visit the exhibit, go to Francollarts around noon. You will have an optional objective to look at the paintings first, and you can also find a Letter from the wife of Count Beledal on a drink crate near them. Talk to the count and he will award you with The White Wolf, by Count Beledal, which you can hang in Corvo Bianco. (100) You can then have some optional conversation, after which the quest completes.
Important: If you ask about his daughter this will count as ""Proof of Compassion"" but only if you freed the Panther without killing it.","Talk to Count Beledal.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_Bovine_Blues,Contracts,"This quest can be acquired by reading a notice on Flovive's notice board or Ardaiso Quarry's notice board, although you'd practically have started it at the latter. You can also acquire it by interacting with one of the areas where this quest takes place.
When you reach the quarry go talk to Foreman Pafnuzio, who is trying to convince his remaining workers to restart their work but to no avail. After asking about everything and possibly haggling, go check the cow carcass which has attracted some ghouls and an alghoul. When done with them, examine the carcass thoroughly for Geralt to deduce the culprit is a draconid, most likely a wyvern, and decide he should check the broken crane next. After examining the crane, Geralt will find a trail of blood so follow it to find the target. (50)
Eventually you will find some stills infested with rotfiends you'll need to get rid of. Examining the half-eaten corpse next to some barrels will lead Geralt to conclude the beast is a slyzard, a fire-breathing draconid. You may also find bootlegger's notes on the table there. Now check the huge blood stain right next to the stills and follow the footprints. They will lead you to another big blood stain, examine it and Geralt will remark that there is a second draconid which joined the injured one, however as it was still bleeding the trail should lead him to the nest.
The trail continues east, where you may find another bovine carcass near a tree, but regardless it will lead to the base of a hill, and Geralt will deduce the nest must be at the top. However, if the player has already killed the two Slyzards and destroyed their nest – during the first part of Scavenger Hunt: Grandmaster Griffin Gear, for example – Geralt will instead comment on how he already took care of them, but that he should check the top of the hill just to be sure.
Prepare your Draconid oil and climb (easier from the west) to meet the Slyzards. (150) This boss battle is unique in two ways. First of all you will be fighting two bosses at the same time, and second they share a health bar which is also not full from the start, due to the smaller Slyzard's injury. Kill them both and take the trophy and Dahlia from the Slyzard Matriarch. You will also have the option to destroy the nest, which you may do during the fight unintentionally by using signs or bombs. (100)
Note: Unlike most regular monster nests, Geralt will not attempt to place a bomb, but rather cast Igni to destroy it. Also unlike other nests, destroying it gives quest .
There is also an Igni Place of Power beneath the nest, the entrance to reach it is west from there, but is best approached from the south. Regardless, return to the foreman with the trophy to get your reward. (200) The workers will still not wish to return to their job due to some other quarry workers missing for 3 days. The foreman will convince them by saying they are expecting a whole week delay there, however he will tell Geralt that he lied and will ask him to speak to him about the matter when he can. This will conclude the quest and start Big Feet to Fill.
Scrambled Eggs[]
If you do not destroy the nest and if you haven't already cleared the nearby Filibert Fourfinger's hanse, a bandit camp will appear at Fort Ussar Ruins, where you fought the Slyzards. There will be 2 bandits there named Mathieu Le Mièche and Mikael Le Mièche, once you dispose of them you can loot their chest to find the recipe for scrambled slyzard eggs.","Find the quarry foreman.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Contract:_The_Tufo_Monster,Contracts,"To start the quest, you may pick up a notice from Flovive's notice board, or directly find Jean-Christophe de Bourbeau at Tufo (northeast of Flovive), who will call out to Geralt. Talk to him, and respond however you wish to his demands for etiquette. You can ask about the monster causing noises and the missing workers, as well as haggle before you accept the contract, and after that he will give you the key to his cellar.
The cellar[]
If you enter it during the day, Geralt will remark that it's quiet and that the monster must be nocturnal, so meditate until it's dark. When it's dark you will indeed hear tremors, and after examining a broken jar one of the walls will crack and you can use Aard to break it. Inside you will find tunnels full of kikimores and their eggs, which you can destroy with Igni, earning an extra reward later. After you investigate thoroughly, Geralt will decide to head back up.
Upon returning to the cellar, you will be ""greeted"" by Jean-Christophe and his wife Andrée de Bourbeau, and if you destroyed the kikimore eggs, Jean-Christophe will pay Geralt 100  for it (200). After explaining the situation, Madame de Bourbeau will tell you everything she knows about the missing worker Jean-Luc, after which you need to go check the place he went missing.
Further investigation[]
After investigating the area it will become clear that Jean-Luc and Andrée were having a picnic instead of working. Nearby you will find footprints, so follow them until they split shortly ahead. The female ones turn back to the estate (and disappear), so continue following the male ones, which lead to some blood splatters and monster tracks to follow. Along the way you will find more and more clues on what you are dealing with, and if enough are examined Geralt will deduce it's a shaelmaar. The tracks will lead to a cave system called Owl Eye Grottos and continue inside, where you can follow them a long way to the lair.
Note: This is the same cave where you find the second half of diagrams during Scavenger Hunt: Grandmaster Ursine Gear and, if you haven't completed it yet, you may encounter giant centipedes as part of that quest. The cave actually has two entrances and the tracks lead exactly to the one where a giant centipede spawns, but it's possible to take the other entrance, around 45 feet southeast, and land straight into the Tufo monster's lair.
Meeting the Monster[]
Once you reach the lair, Geralt decides to make Shaelmaar bait to lure the monster out. However, he needs fresh human blood as an ingredient, so you will have to take it from one of the nearby corpses. Only one of the corpses will be fresh enough, and it turns out it's Jean-Luc's. There are also plenty of sewant mushrooms around if you somehow don't have them already.
Note: Next to Jean-Luc's body, his silver pendant can be found, which can later be given to either of the de Bourbeaus for an extra reward.
When you make the bait, it shall be equipped in a pocket, so use it in the marked locations. However, note that more locations than necessary are marked, and it's best to prepare yourself for the fight beforehand, as The Monster of Tufo will appear immediately after. Like every shaelmaar, it is blind but uses its sense of hearing to locate its victim. Using Aard can dupe it into crashing into a wall. However, unlike other shaelmaar, it will pick itself up quicker. Once it's dead, loot it for the Shaelmaar trophy and Ami, then head back to the Tufo estate for your reward(s).
Important: Killing the Monster of Tufo will count as ""Proof of Valor"" for There Can Be Only One.
Turning the quest in[]
It makes a difference if you found the pendant and what you do with it:
Give it to Jean-Christophe, exposing his wife's affair (50 / 100 ; can only be done before accepting the contract reward)
Give it to Andrée, keeping her affair secret (200 / 120 ; can be done at any time, even after quest completion)
If given to the husband, he will throw out his wife for her infidelity. If given to the wife (she's sitting in front of the small red house), there doesn't seem to be further consequences. You can also just keep it, but it can't be sold or dismantled.
Important: Giving the pendant to Andrée will count as ""Proof of Compassion"" for There Can Be Only One.
Regardless, once you tell Jean-Christophe that the monster is dead, he will finally have a positive remark towards Geralt and will pay 500  or the haggled amount, completing the quest. (400)","If Geralt found the notice first:

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Equine_Phantoms,Contracts,"Talk to the hermit and she will explain she is hunted by some demon, then when Geralt tells her he can't see anything she will explain that no one can see it unless they drink a brew made from an extinct mushroom called graytop, which she managed to grow. Now you will have the option to haggle with her, however, she will explain that she has no money and can only offer potatoes. You can agree to the payment or tell her you will help her for free, after which you start looking for clues.
Important: If you try to haggle and then agree to work for free this will count as ""Proof of Generosity"" for the secondary quest There Can Be Only One.
Outside the hut are dead moths, and inside you will find a note and graytop on the table, as well as a blood-stained pillow on the bed. Inspecting the pillow will show a trail of blood leading through the small window that then ends a bit further away outside, where Geralt's medallion will detect magic, but nothing can be seen. The note is completely optional and depending on the order of inspection, you may not have to follow the blood trail, but eventually you have enough proof that something is drinking Pinastri's blood at night and you have to talk to her again. It is then decided that Geralt has to drink the brew himself in order to solve the case. Important: You can delay this if you wish, but once you drink it you'll be locked in the quest, and straying away from it will cause it to fail.
The hermit gives you a portion of common graytop brew and after drinking it Geralt will notice he can now talk to his trusted horse Roach. After an amusing conversation, you will now be helping her solve the case and start looking for clues again. If you walk around a bit, you can talk to nearby animals too, but shortly after you inspect the moths again, Roach finds the culprit - an umbra that you now have to chase on her back. No matter what you do you can't catch it (but don't give up or the quest will fail) and the chase will eventually take you to Mont Crane Cemetery.
When you arrive, the umbra dissipates and you will be attacked by four panther apparitions. They aren't particularly strong, but keep in mind they are specters and not real animals. Once they are defeated, examine the grave and a knight's spirit will emerge. He explains the whole story and how it's Pinastri who doesn't give him peace. You will have two options - ask Roach to forgive him in the name of his horse, or say that he doesn't deserve mercy and fight him.
If Roach forgives him, then he will leave for good. If you choose to fight him he will use a halberd, but nothing special apart from that. After he is defeated, loot him for the umbra trophy and you will then return to Pinastri, who will refuse to forgive the knight, thus he will eventually return. In this case, upon returning to Pinastri some time later, she can be found dead in her bed and upon examining her body, Geralt will confirm that the umbra did indeed return and drank all of Pinastri's blood.
Regardless, the hermit will be grateful and unless you haggled and refused, she gives you 60 potatoes, after which the quest completes. (150)","Use your Witcher Senses to investigate the area and find out what's tormenting the hermit.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Feet_as_Cold_as_Ice,Contracts,"You can start the quest by either talking to Jacquette, who you can find near the Nilfgaardian Embassy, in which case she will be calling out to Geralt and you can haggle the price with her, by finding François le Goff near the cave located Northwest from the Beauclair Palace, or lastly by strolling into the cave itself. If you find François at his camp, he'll be asleep and snoring no matter what time it is, so wake him up.
Note: If you completed signing up for the tourney in The Warble of a Smitten Knight, Geralt can introduce himself with either of his Knight titles.
After a short conversation, François will agree it's time to fight Grottore, and you can offer to help him or tell him to get going. If you offer to help, he will join your party and his health bar will be visible. However, if you walk too far away he will die, so if you want him to live, follow him into the cave. If you tell him to go alone, you can still follow him or leave the area in which case he will die as well, and the quest will update telling you to check on the knight. After you enter the cave you will find what's left of him, and you will have the option to investigate and kill the monster by yourself.
Note: If you go investigate and find François' body after having refused to help or after offering to help but abandoning him, it is actually optional to continue investigating and kill Grottore; you are able to return to Jacquette directly.
After you investigate the main chamber thoroughly, Geralt will deduce that Grottore is a Spriggan, after which you will have to check your journal on how to deal with the beast. After you prepare yourself, you have to burn the flowers using Igni to lure it out. Grottore will summon Archespores during the fight, but you can actually use that to your advantage by using a Superior Golden Oriole. Also if you have Fixative at least at Level 2 (since Patch 4.0) you can use its ability to apply both Cursed oil and Relict oil simultaneously. After it's dead and François is still alive, Geralt will converse with him and have two options: either convince him to return to Jacquette or tell him to do as he wishes, in which case you get to keep the Grottore trophy. You can also loot Grottore's corpse for a Fen'aeth sword. Regardless, it's time to return to Jacquette.
If François died, she will be devastated and you get no reward by default, regardless whether you avenged him or not. If you ask for one, Jacquette will become furious but will eventually give you the reward.
If François is alive and Geralt convinced him to return to her, she will be very happy and tell Geralt that they are getting married in a week, and she will pay you your promised reward.
If François is alive and Geralt told him to do what he wants, she will have realized François' true motives after he made a new pledge to bring her a striped horse from Zerrikania and will have broken off their engagement, but she will pay Geralt his reward nevertheless.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Applied_Escapology,Treasure_hunts,"You will find a corpse on the west part of Crane Isle, where the Toussaint Prison stands. Loot it to find the escape artist's journal and read it. Now drink a Killer Whale and dive into the water and look for a cave, where inside you will find a skeleton holding a key, take it then go to the next location.
If you've already done Turn and Face the Strange, it's the same location where you entered the lab, only now you need to enter the underwater cave right by the shore. It's a long dive and Geralt can easily get stuck down there, so Killer Whale is almost a must again. At the far end of the tunnel you will find a chest, and unlocking it completes the quest. There are plenty of other valuables around the chest as well as inside it.","Read the escapologist's journal.
Find a key near the flooded tunnel.
Find the sunken ruins and the elven treasure."
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Around_the_World_in..._Eight_Days,Treasure_hunts,"You can pick up this quest from a chest, which can be found east of Coronata Vineyard, guarded by some bandits. Inside you will find diagram: Toussaint Ducal Guardsman's trousers, a key, and an unfinished report; the latter when read directs you to the treasure location. You can also find a journal on a nearby corpse.
At the marked location you will find two more bandits standing near a wagon. Kill them then unlock the casket located right behind the wagon to finish the quest. While not part of the quest, the other big chest nearby has Blinders of the Five Chivalric Virtues.","Read the bandit's notes.
Find the sunken wagon in the lake."
"https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/But_Other_Than_That,_How_Did_You_Enjoy_the_Play%3F",Treasure_hunts,"Head to Seidhe Llygad Amphitheater, south of the Palace Gardens and across the lake. When you reach the place Geralt will remark that something isn't right and you'll probably hear a Water Hag down at the beach, but ignore it - you need to be at the amphitheater. Once there, you will find the corpse of a woman right where the hidden treasure marker is. Loot it to find a Perfume-laced journal and ""Vis la Crac"" Wine. Read the journal and Geralt will decide to re-enact the performance just like her.
Use your witcher senses to find her footprints and after examining them you'll get the objective to find out the correct order to follow. You merely have to find the one candle with footsteps leading only away from it, but if you're having trouble - the correct starting location is right when facing the corpse. Light the candle there and then follow the footsteps, doing the same at each end, eventually forming a pentagram. Nothing happens if you get it wrong, the sequence just resets.
Important: Performing the play correctly on the first try will count as ""Proof of Wisdom"" for There Can Be Only One.
Once all the candles are lit, you have to drink the wine, but it's best prepare yourself with Specter oil before doing so. The wine is a special quest item, don't bother looking among your food. Drink it and the Phantom of the Amphitheater (a strong banshee) will appear. It can be a tough opponent if you are unprepared and will call skeletons for aid occasionally - dispose of those fast to not get overwhelmed.
After the wraith is defeated, search its remains to find an Ornate necklace with a key-shaped pendant, which will open a gate located southwest inside the arena, behind a fallen pillar. Loot the casket located inside for a Dust-covered journal and some valuables to end the quest.","Read the diary.

After the trolls there are dealt with, look for a dead man's body, who will have a letter and key on him. Reading the letter will indicate the spot to search at Coronata.
Make your way there and look for the manure pile in the south part of the search area (Geralt will make a comment about the stench if you're close enough). Loot the half hidden chest here to complete the quest.","Read the letter.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Don%27t_Take_Candy_from_a_Stranger,Treasure_hunts,"You'll likely come across this while doing Wine Wars: Vermentino.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Filibert_Always_Pays_His_Debts,Treasure_hunts,"This quest takes place at the the Casteldaccia Abandoned Estate, just a bit east of the signpost. When you enter the estate's courtyard, a Ghostly Knight will appear and naturally must be disposed of. He has the same combat style as, and similar appearance to Gregoire de Gorgon, except of course is vulnerable to silver swords and Specter Oil.
After the enemy is gone, look for a red-glowing corpse and read the note on it to start the quest. You merely have to find the stash now - it is inside the northern house. Find a ladder inside and climb it, then use your witcher senses to find a candle holder which you can activate. This will open a secret compartment, inside of which you will find a chest and the quest ends as you unlock it. If you're interested in the Ghostly Knight's story, read the journal found inside.","Read the notes.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Grandmaster_Feline_Gear,Treasure_hunts,"Head to Bartolomé de Launay's house, which is one of the northern points on the map. If you interact with the door, Geralt will note it's locked, so head around to the right to find some scaffolding and climb up to see into the courtyard, where a group of bandits are holding a captive. Take out the bandits and the captive merchant will explain that he was sent to take inventory of de Launay's things as he's disappeared. You can ask him if he found any witcher diagrams to which he'll respond that he hasn't had a chance to look around, but is ok with you searching the place.
Head into the small red house on the north side of the courtyard and interact with the nearby painting to find the armor diagram (50) and a Letter to Bartolomé de Launay. Read it to learn your next location is the nearby Arthach Palace Ruins. However, this location is a hanse base: a very large (15-20) group of bandits and some dogs too. To make matters worse, if you don't take out the fire runner in time, they'll light a signal that'll call in reinforcements. With the reinforcements the total number of bandits here can get up to the mid 40s.
When you're ready, head out to the ruins. Your best approach is from the east, near the central part of the ruins, as the runner will run up these stairs to get to the signal fire. You only need to take out enough of the group to loot the chest near the signal fire (you can take it out if already lit), but if you don't clear it out, the place will be repopulated with bandits when you return to the area. However you handle things, loot the chest for the boots and trousers diagrams (100) and Hanse leader's notes. Reading this will point you to the final destination.
The Pits of Brume is a guarded cave northwest of the Trading Post where you will encounter two archespores. They are fairly far apart, but keep in mind the tight quarters when dealing with them as they will often spawn in corners with their exploding pods as barriers. Once taken care of, look for a dark corner where a camp fire and cot are set up and loot the nearby container for the last 3 diagrams (silver sword, steel sword and gauntlets; 150) as well as Lexandre's journal to finish the quest.","Note: The order in which these objectives appear may differ depending on the order in which the locations are visited.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Grandmaster_Griffin_Gear,Treasure_hunts,"Make your way to Fort Ussar Ruins where, if you didn't already do Contract: Bovine Blues, there will be a slyzard and its mother in the area. Once you cleared out any threat, head to the eastern side of the ruins to find some stairs with a half hidden crate beneath them. Loot it to retrieve the steel sword, gauntlets, and boots diagrams (150) along with a document. Reading it will point you towards a nearby landmark, Mont Crane Castle.
However, if you haven't already cleared it out, this place can be overwhelming for an ill-equipped player. This is the location of a Hanse, a very large bandit camp (roughly 20 bandits). To make things worse, if you don't take out the fire runner in time, they will light a signal that will call in reinforcements from nearby bandit camps. You don't have to clear the entire base right now if you don't want to, only the lower courtyard, but try to get the runner (freezing him with a Northern Wind is an easy solution) so that more bandits don't appear there. If you didn't get the runner, be quick with the next part and you can cut block reinforcements from reaching you. Note: if you didn't clear out the area entirely, when you return the place will be re-populated with bandits.
Make your way to where the marker is pointing and Geralt will comment he needs to use the Eye of Nehaleni, so interact with it to dispel the illusion, revealing a hidden area.
Exploring the hidden area will reveal a workshop and on one of the tables is a power crystal. Pick it up, then head over to the archway area in the middle of the workshop and use your Witcher Senses to find a hidden button that will move the stone wall, revealing another hidden area. When you enter, you can close the the stone wall from the other end via another button. Just before the portal in this area is a chest you can loot to find Moreau's journal. Reading it will note that Jerome was taken through a portal, so place the power crystal in the indicated area and activate it with Aard. Now head through the portal, but be prepared as a golem will attack as soon as you exit. Deal with the golem then head further into the cave.
The diagrams are spread out a bit here. In the sack on the chair are the trousers, in a tiny box on a shelf near the stove is the armor, and on the table is the silver sword (there's a written note on this one). After all three diagrams are collected the quest completes. (150) There is an illusion nearby that you can use to exit, though note that if you do, a garkain and a fleder will attack when you near the cave's entrance if you haven't been there already.","Note: The order in which these objectives appear may differ depending on the order in which the locations are visited.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Grandmaster_Manticore_Gear,Treasure_hunts,"Your first location will be the ruins of Bastoy Prison Ruins, a place located south of Fort Astre Ruins. When you get here, be careful if you haven't already checked the area, as a treasure hunt quest, The Toussaint Prison Experiment, is here, guarded over by an alp. Deal with her if necessary, then look for the standing tower on the northeast part of the ruins and climb up to the room at the top. Loot the brick in the wall (near the entryway) to find the steel sword diagram (50) and the Prisoner's journal. Reading the journal will point you to your next location: a cave where Lebioda once stayed.
This cave is located southeast of Gélenser Farm and southwest of Termes Palace Ruins, with a panther typically guarding the outside. Deal with it, then head inside to find a large cavern with prayer notes all over the walls. The one you want is on the furthest wall from the entrance. Interact with them until you find Merten's prayer and read it to get the armor diagram and the third location: Lebioda's temple. (50)
This temple is located near the Prophet Lebioda Statue. When you head in, head to the furthest wall and use Aard to reveal a hidden area. As soon as you enter the new room, the Great Beggar's Ghost (a specter) will attack. Take care of it, then look around the room. Note that you can loot the skeleton for the Bones of the Great Beggar, which will start an easy secondary quest, The Words of the Prophets Are Written on Sarcophagi. For the diagrams, look for the small container on a table near the stairs opposite from the entrance to find the trousers and boots along with The Great Beggar's journal. (100) This will point Geralt to a cave known as Murky Delve, which is south of the Palace Gardens and northwest of Seidhe Llygad Amphitheater.
This cave acts like a trial of sorts, though there is no failed path, only easy fighting versus several monsters. Swim inside and you'll shortly come across a purple mist. This won't cause any harm but it will cause Geralt to hallucinate. Continue on to see what appears to be a young nude woman with another nearby. However, if you approach her, it's revealed the two are actually bruxae and will attack. You can take them out or, to avoid fighting, don't head towards her but go to the left, deeper into the cave.
The next area has 5 beggars. If it isn't obvious enough what to do, Geralt will comment that this must be a test. Give each one alms (10  each) to make them disappear. If you bypass them instead (or didn't give to each one), they'll disappear and an archespore will attack. Note: if you don't have enough coin, there's 58  nearby to loot to give to the beggars.
In the next area you'll see 3 kikimore workers attacking a hallucination of a townsman but also a treasure pile to the left. If you help him out, you only need to kill 3, but if go for the supposed treasure, you won't get any and 4 kikimores will attack. Continue on to find a blocked path, so use Aard to enter the final area. Head up the path to see another hallucination, this time of a man in prayer, Lebioda. As you approach he'll stand up before disappearing. Loot the container that was near him for the silver sword diagram and Merten's notes.. (50) Reading them will point to the final destination, the Lake of Cleansing.
The lake is northeast of Basane Farm and where a small group of bandits are gathered around a pier. If you approach from this side, they'll attack you and will lead to Geralt making an amusing comment afterwards. You can loot their chest for 100 orens and multiple valuables if you wish. Now head out to the middle of the lake (just off the pier) and use Witcher Senses to see the red marker. Retrieve it to get the gauntlets diagram and Merten's last letter, completing the quest.

https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenger_Hunt:_Grandmaster_Ursine_Gear,Treasure_hunts,"After picking up the quest from Lafargue, head out to Tufo Vineyard, which is north of Flovive. Once you reach the village, you'll see the house that the bear witcher, Junod of Belhaven, had been at to complete his contract. However, the house has since collapsed. Go through the house or around it to the back to find a large hole in the backyard. Clear away the rubble to reveal a small cavern system. Just inside, to the right in a small alcove, is a chest with 3 of the diagrams (silver sword, armor, and gauntlets) along with a note. Read the note to get the next location.
Note: If you further explore the tunnel, there's a guarded treasure at its end - not easy to find just by the marker from above ground. It is guarded by a couple of Wraiths, but they seem to only appear at night.
The note will point you to a location north of the area, called Owl Eye Grottos. Head there to find a cave entrance and drop down and, almost as soon as you reach the bottom floor, a giant centipede will attack. Take care of it, then head back to the waterfall ledge and, in the corner opposite where the giant centipede was, you'll see a rock wall you can blast. Once through, pick up the note Jonod left behind, saying to follow his marks. Continue through the cave system, following the marks, until you come across another river. Just as you drop down a ledge, another giant centipede should make itself visible down the left path. Head into this small area and take care of it, then look for a skeleton in the same room to find the last 3 diagrams (trousers, steel sword, and boots) along with Junod of Belhaven's journal.
Note: This is the same cave that you have to explore during Contract: The Tufo Monster. As it happens to be in a place far from any signposts, it is convenient to complete both quests at once.

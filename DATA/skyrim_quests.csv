"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Affairs_of_Hagravens","Find Melka imprisoned in Blind Cliff Cave. Protect her from Forsworn as you travel through the tower. Kill Petra.","A Hagraven in Need[edit] Upon entering Blind Cliff Bastion you will see the hagraven Melka in a cage. As you approach her, she will ask you to free her and help her reclaim her tower from another hagraven, Petra. To release Melka, pull the chain near the cage. After leaving the cage she will then lead you through her tower. The first room displays a central stone slab adorned with three handles; Melka will tell you that the middle one is the correct one to use. Pull the handle and go through the gate it opens. Follow the short path into a room inhabited by a Forsworn. There will then be a gate with a tunnel full of swinging blades. Melka will mention a lever that will stop the blades: she will then pull a handle on the floor that lowers a section of a wall, revealing another lever to do just that. Reclaiming the Tower[edit] Move through the tunnel and go up the stairs. After the stairs you will pass a section of wall that moves away when the nearby handle is pulled. Through the newly cleared section of wall are some ingots and a chest. The next room has an alchemy lab, and is referred to by Melka as her ""parlor"". Follow the path past the quicksilver ore. The next room contains Petra and two Forsworn. Killing them and Petra will result in Melka rewarding you with the unique staff, Eye of Melka. If Melka died anywhere along the way you can simply loot the staff from her corpse."

Return for your reward.","This quest is initiated from Tolfdir at the College of Winterhold after becoming Arch-Mage. When asked ""Is there anything I should be aware of?"" Tolfdir will respond that there is some sort of magical disturbance which seems to be related to the Eye of Magnus, and will provide a quest location. Travel to the quest location given. The map marker will point you to any one of twenty-seven locations in Skyrim (there are three possible locations in each hold). Defeat the Magic Anomalies and return to Tolfdir for a leveled gold reward.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alchemy_Tutorial","Ask for permission to use the alchemy lab. Combine the ingredients at an alchemy lab to create a potion.","The Recipe[edit] Ask any of the quest givers if you can use the alchemy lab located in their shop or inn, as the case may be. They will all consent with the same reply, ""Long as you clean up. You know how to use it right? Mix a couple of ingredients together, see what happens. A little Wheat and Blisterwort makes a healing potion, if you didn't know. We have plenty of ingredients for sale, too.""  This is just a suggestion, crafting any potion will complete the quest objective, you can buy ingredients directly from the quest giver. Crafting the Potion[edit] Once your ingredients are collected, approach the alchemy lab and select at least two of them. Note that to succeed into crafting a potion, each ingredient must share an alchemical effect with another. Confirm the crafting and create a potion to complete the quest. After this, the effect will be added to the Alchemy menu if you don't have it already."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alduin%27s_Bane","Read the Elder Scroll at the Throat of the World. Learn how to use the Dragonrend shout. Defeat Alduin.","The Time-Wound[edit] As soon as you claim the Elder Scroll from the Tower of Mzark, this quest starts and points you back to the Throat of the World where Paarthurnax awaits. Exit the tower by using the lift to the east and pull the handle on the surface, thus providing yet another shortcut to Blackreach. You will find yourself a long way from Alftand where you initially entered and may wish to loot the abandoned camp just outside the tower entrance. Travel back to the Throat of the World and Paarthurnax will be quite impressed with your efforts: ""You have it. The Kel - the Elder Scroll. Tiid kreh... qalos. Time shudders at its touch. There is no question. You are doom-driven. Kogaan Akatosh. The very bones of the earths are at your disposal. Go then. Fulfill your destiny. Take the Scroll to the Time-Wound. Do not delay. Alduin will be coming. He cannot miss the signs."" Make your way a few feet to the northwest and you will see the Time-Wound, an unnatural ripple of air that distorts light passing through it. Go into the middle, find the Elder Scroll in your inventory, and read it:  A Glimpse into the Past[edit] ""Know that Gormlaith sent you down to death!"" ""Which is why I brought the Elder Scroll."" ""Alduin approaches!"" ""Begone, World-Eater!"" ""You are banished!"" After a temporary blindness, you will regain your vision and find yourself in the Merethic Era, unable to move and forced to watch past events. The strange carvings on the Elder Scroll will still be visible and your vision blurred and tinted red. You will watch as the ancient Nords, Hakon One-Eye and Gormlaith Golden-Hilt, fight a dragon atop the Throat of the World. The battle will begin with Hakon on his own, until Gormlaith comes rushing in and jumps on top of the dragon: Hakon: ""Gormlaith! We're running out of time! The battle..."" Dragon: ""Daar sul thur se Alduin vokrii. Today Alduin's lordship will be restored. But I honor your courage. Krif voth ahkrin. Die now, in vain."" Hakon: (attacks) ""For Skyrim!"" Gormlaith: (joins the attack and kills the dragon) ""Know that Gormlaith sent you down to death!"" After killing the dragon they will sheathe their swords and walk past a desecrated corpse, talking about their victory: Gormlaith: ""Hakon! A glorious day, is it not!"" Hakon: ""Have you no thought beyond the blooding of your blade?"" Gormlaith: ""What else is there?"" Hakon: ""The battle below goes ill. If Alduin does not rise to our challenge, I fear all may be lost."" Gormlaith: ""You worry too much, brother. Victory will be ours."" At this point, Felldir the Old will emerge from behind you and join the conversation: Hakon: (To Felldir) ""Why does Alduin hang back? We've staked everything on this plan of yours, old man."" Felldir: ""He will come. He cannot ignore our defiance. And why should he fear us, even now?"" Gormlaith: ""We've bloodied him well. Four of his kin have fallen to my blade alone this day."" Felldir: ""But none have yet stood against Alduin himself. Galthor, Sorri, Birkir..."" Gormlaith: ""They did not have Dragonrend. Once we bring him down, I promise I will have his head."" Felldir: ""You do not understand. Alduin cannot be slain like a lesser dragon. He is beyond our strength. Which is why I brought the Elder Scroll."" Felldir will then pull out the ancient Elder Scroll, much to the surprise of Hakon: Hakon: ""Felldir! We agreed not to use it!"" Felldir: ""I never agreed. And if you are right, I will not need it."" Hakon: ""No. We will deal with Alduin ourselves, here and now."" Gormlaith: ""We shall see soon enough. Alduin approaches!"" Hakon: ""So be it."" While the Nords draw their weapons, Alduin will land atop the word wall and speak: Alduin: ""Meyye! Tahrodiis aanne! Him hinde pah liiv! Zu'u hin daan!"" Gormlaith: ""Let those that watch from Sovngarde envy us this day!"" At this point, the Nords will release the Dragonrend shout. When they shout, you will automatically learn the shout. In the skies, Alduin will feel mortality rise through his body and will immediately be forced to land: Alduin: ""Nivahriin joorre! What have you done? What twisted Words have you created?! Tahrodiis Paarthurnax! My teeth to his neck! But first... dir ko maar. You will die in terror, knowing your final fate... To feed my power when I come for you in Sovngarde!"" Gormlaith: ""If I die today, it will not be in terror. You feel fear for the first time, worm. I see it in your eyes. Skyrim will be free!"" The three Nords will then proceed to attack the World-Eater, but to no avail. Alduin will pick up Gormlaith between his teeth and fling her to the right, killing her: Hakon: ""No, damn you! It's no use! Use the Scroll, Felldir! Now!"" Felldir: ""Hold, Alduin on the Wing! Sister Hawk, grant us your sacred breath to make this contract heard! Begone, World-Eater! By words with older bones than your own we break your perch on this age and send you out! You are banished! Alduin, we shout you out from all our endings unto the last!"" Alduin: ""Faal Kel...?! Nikriinne..."" A surprised Alduin will futilely breathe fire at Felldir before disappearing into the flow of time, to an unknown era. Felldir, however, knows that the defeat was only temporary: Felldir: ""You are banished!"" Hakon: ""It worked... you did it..."" Felldir: ""Yes, the World-Eater is gone... may the spirits have mercy on our souls."" Alduin[edit] Directly after the cutscene, when you arrive back in the present, Alduin will appear at the Throat of the World, shouting: ""Bahloki nahkip sillesejoor. My belly is full of the souls of your fellow mortals, Dovahkiin. Die now and await your fate in Sovngarde!"" Paarthurnax will then interfere, saying: ""Lost funt. You are too late, Alduin! Dovahkiin! Use Dragonrend, if you know it!"" Alduin battles Paarthurnax at the Throat of the World. Paarthurnax and Alduin will take flight, attacking each other in the air. Paarthurnax tells you to use your Dragonrend shout if you can, and indeed, when the chance arises, use Dragonrend on Alduin, forcing him to the ground. It can be rather difficult distinguishing between the two dragons if the battle is done at night or while it is snowing.  The quest arrow on your compass always points to Alduin, so use that to distinguish between them. During the battle, Alduin may say some of the following taunts: ""Dovahkiin, you call yourself? Arrogant mortal."", ""Bahloki nahkip sillesejoor."", ""I will feast on your soul in Sovngarde!"", ""You are no match for me, joor!"", ""Paarthurnax is weak. I am strong."", ""My time has come again."", ""Maar saraan ko Sovngarde."", ""I have feasted on many greater than you."", or ""You will pay for your defiance!"" When Alduin is grounded, he may say: ""My teeth to your neck, Dovahkiin!"" When he is grounded, you must attack him as much as you can before he takes flight again. This may take a few tries, since he has a huge health pool and does reasonable damage. Be wary of Alduin's ""Dragon Storm Call"" shout, which causes fiery meteors to rain from the sky, causing both fire and physical damage. Note that Clear Skies will cancel the meteor shower, and has such a short recharge time that it won't interfere with using Dragonrend on him. In particular, using Dragonrend immediately when it recharges will keep Alduin grounded for the whole fight. When Alduin's health drops to zero, he says: ""Meyz mul, Dovahkiin. You have become strong. But I am Al-du-in, Firstborn of Akatosh! Mulaagi zok lot! I cannot be slain here, by you or anyone else! You cannot prevail against me. I will outlast you... mortal!"" He will then fly off, completing the quest."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alduin%27s_Wall","Escort Esbern to Riverwood. Talk to Esbern. Gain entrance to Sky Haven Temple. Learn the secret of Alduin's Wall.","Blades Reunited[edit] From The Ratway in Riften, it is necessary to travel with Esbern back to Riverwood so he can meet with Delphine. Make your way out of the Ratway by backtracking the way you came in, avoiding or defeating the Thalmor agents and various underworld criminals you may encounter along the way. The Esbern dialogue option ""Do you know the way out of here?"" will cause Esbern to lead the way through the Ratway rather than follow you (however, this can be glitched). Once outside, travel back to Riverwood and into the Sleeping Giant Inn. Upon arriving at the inn, you will be greeted by Delphine, who is surprised to see Esbern alive. After a brief reunion between the two former Blades, Delphine will wish to speak to the two of you in private. Delphine will lead you to the secret cellar, where Esbern announces that his intention is to find an ancient Blades prophecy. He will go on to say the group must leave for Sky Haven Temple, a Blades headquarters built up around an ancient Akaviri military camp in the Reach. Of particular importance within that location is a structure from the First Era known as Alduin's Wall, which may tell how to defeat Alduin. Delphine soon realizes that Esbern's description of the temple's location matches her knowledge of the Karthspire, and the Blades agree to set out for that location. Delphine tells Orgnar that the Inn is now his and bids him farewell. At this point, you can choose to either travel with the Blades or alone, heading towards the marker Delphine placed on your map. If you choose to travel alone, it may be easier to take a carriage to Markarth and then head east, as Delphine recommends. You can also take the longer route through Falkreath Hold, though this is generally easier if you have the Blades with you. The Karthspire[edit] Whether you went as a group or solo, when you arrive at the Karthspire Camp you will find yourself up against a horde of Forsworn, and possibly a hagraven. Both Delphine and Esbern will arrive and assist you (and probably aggravate the entire camp in the process: if you want to make sure they don't do that, you may have to ask them to ""wait here"" a considerable distance away.) Though you can stand and fight, if the battle begins to overwhelm you, it is simple to retreat into the Karthspire caverns themselves (but see the Bugs section). You will now need to journey through the interior of the Karthspire, defeating the three Forsworn, including a Forsworn Briarheart, and making your way to the beginning of the Akaviri ruins. Sky Haven Temple[edit] Heading up the stone steps on the right you will be confronted with a trio of three-sided pillars, each side inscribed with a symbol. According to Esbern, they are of Akaviri origin, but the one that matters most to you is the symbol meaning 'Dragonborn'. This symbol resembles two dragon heads facing each other and an arrow pointing down. Activate all three pillars until this symbol is facing you. This will lower the bridge to your left, allowing you and the Blades to continue. In the next chamber you will be confronted with a floor of pressure plates, inscribed with the same three symbols as the pillars. Once again the Dragonborn symbol is the key; stepping only on these tiles to reach the other side. Stepping off of the route will cause a fireball to be launched, so moving slowly is advisable. If you prefer, you can use the Whirlwind Sprint shout to move across without triggering the trap. Once safely on the other side, pull the chain to allow the Blades to cross, and exit the chamber. You will need to travel across a pair of bridges, and then into the entrance chamber of Sky Haven Temple. Esbern heads for a large stone head built into the far wall, which, according to Esbern, is the visage of Reman Cyrodiil. In fact, the entire temple is some sort of shrine to him. In front of the head is a large carved circle, which Esbern declares to be a ""blood seal"", requiring the blood of a Dragonborn to function. Activating the circle prompts you to cut your hand, dripping blood on the circle. The stone head then retracts, and an opening is revealed. Delphine and Esbern take a few moments in the following tunnel to inspect the Akaviri carvings and light the braziers, but you may wish to run ahead and view the temple proper. Upon arriving, Esbern is immediately attracted to a large relief on the far wall, Alduin's Wall. He moves over to inspect it, taking several moments to fully identify it. The wall depicts the history of Alduin and the Dragon Cult, and details a prophecy regarding their defeat. Ultimately, he proclaims that the ancient Nords actually used a shout to defeat Alduin, and Delphine turns to you asking if you know of such a shout. Alduin's Wall relief At this point, your best source of information is likely the Greybeards, however much Delphine may dislike them. Esbern will go on to explain that the last panel speaks of Alduin's return and his contending with the last Dragonborn at the end of time. From here, take a moment to explore the Temple to locate the leveled sword Dragonbane found in a room almost straight opposite Alduin's Wall. Bid farewell to the two Blades, both of them enraptured by Sky Haven Temple, and leave the building. Your next destination is High Hrothgar, home of the Greybeards. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: Alduin's Wall (20 points/Bronze)"

Return to Tolfdir.","Kahvozein's Fang[edit] To initiate this quest, you must have an Alteration skill of 90 or higher. Speak with Tolfdir and ask if there is anything new that he can teach you. He tells you that he has been working on a new spell but, to complete his research, he needs heartscales. These must be cut from a dragon's skeleton and can only be done using a dagger called Kahvozein's Fang. He asks you to retrieve the blade, which can be found in a radiant dragon priest dungeon. Possible dungeons are listed below: Dungeon Category Region   Forelhost  Nordic Ruins  The Rift   High Gate Ruins  Nordic Ruins  The Pale   Lost Valkygg  Ruins  Hjaalmarch   Ragnvald  Nordic Ruins  The Reach   Valthume  Nordic Ruins  The Reach   Volskygge  Nordic Ruins  Haafingar The Heartscales[edit] Once you have the dagger, you must either slay a dragon or locate a dragon corpse in order to retrieve the heartscales. If you intend on hunting down a live dragon, it is not necessary to slay it using Kahvozein's Fang. You need only equip the dagger in your right hand (it won't work with your left hand) and loot the creature's corpse. The heartscales will automatically be added to your inventory. Once you have the scales, bring them back to Tolfdir.  He will reward you with the Dragonhide spell tome, and will now sell the Mass Paralysis spell tome."

When speaking to Kharjo, he will remark that the caravan was ambushed by a group of bandits. Normally, the Khajiit are able to scare away this type of nuisance, but this time the bandits made off with his heirloom amulet. The amulet was given to him by his mother when he was a cub, and is the only thing to keep him warm in this cold land. When you tell him that you will retrieve it for him, he is appreciative of your desire to help, but will also say that it is not enough to lose your life over.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ancestral_Worship","Talk to Golldir outside Hillgrund's Tomb. Accompany him as he tries to rescue his aunt Agna from Vals Veran. Find a way into the room where Vals Veran is hiding. Kill Vals Veran. *(Optional) Protect Golldir.","Necromancer in the Barrow[edit] Within the antechamber of Hillgrund's Tomb, you'll encounter a Nord named Golldir. He explains that a necromancer named Vals Veran is inside his ancestral barrow, defiling it. His aunt Agna went in to put a stop to this, but Golldir was too scared to go with her. If pressed, he will explain that he has been terrified of the barrow ever since his father locked him in it as a child. If you accept, he will accompany you into the barrow to help rescue his aunt and kill Veran. Rescuing Agna[edit] The tomb is very linear and any offshoots are only small, dead-end rooms. As you continue down the stairs, draugr will attack in small waves. Several varieties will be present in each wave. Like all normal barrows, exploration into the burial sites will lead to more attacks as entombed draugr come to life. Golldir may raise a vocal objection to you looting his ancestors, but concedes to allowing it since you are helping him. There is no chance of successfully rescuing Aunt Agna; at the bottom of the room you'll find her corpse. The door to the burial chamber where Veran is located is barred shut. Reaching Vals Veran[edit] With more resolve, Golldir will lead you through the abandoned section of the barrow to find a secret way into the chamber where Veran is hiding. This section is full of his disgraced ancestors and the draugr numbers are larger here. Stronger varieties of draugr are entombed in the walls, but should only appear singly. After passing through a room with a single spider ambush, a simple puzzle will present itself. Before you leave the spider room look for a Sanctified Mace behind the web on the left of the room. In order to pass the puzzle the plaque with a bear on it must be located. A chain hanging from that plaque will open a secret door that leads to the main chamber. Confronting Vals Veran[edit] If you've had problems up until now, this next area may prove very troublesome. The room is a large tiered burial chamber with sarcophagi all around. As you approach the top, Vals Veran will come out and start speaking of death's beauty. Whether you try to talk to him, attack him, or let him finish his speech, he will eventually disappear and teleport across the room. Attacking him at this juncture is futile as he will simply teleport across the room and heal. If you are quick, you can kill him with a single power attack before he teleports, but you will still need to fight off the waves of draugr. You can also kill him using a sneak attack almost as soon as you enter the room, if your Sneak and Archery skills are high enough—but once again, you'll still have to deal with all the draugr. A goal is also to keep Golldir alive through the battle, to earn the gold reward. If you don't manage to kill Veran instantly, you'll need to focus instead on the waves of draugr. They can quickly swarm you and any followers while Veran casts damaging Frost magic from afar. The third wave of draugr will contain a boss-level draugr that must be dealt with. After dispatching it, Veran will continue to summon more draugr (but in lesser numbers), but most importantly, will stop teleporting. He can now be hunted down and killed. Golldir will thank you for your help and state that he will remain close by the tomb and spend his time hunting. Reward[edit] Killing Vals Veran will grant you the Hillgrund's Tomb Crypt Key, which can be found on Veran's body. The highest reward is only granted if Golldir is kept alive. If he survives, he will give you a large leveled amount of gold and a Hillgrund's Chest Key, which opens an augmented loot chest, located just beyond the main burial chamber (where the battle with Veran took place), through the door at the top of the stairs. Beyond the chest is the barred door leading to the room in which Aunt Agna's body was found. If you do not receive this key, you can loot it from Golldir's corpse or just pick the expert-leveled lock on the chest. After you exit the tomb you can speak to Golldir again (if he's alive) about becoming a follower. This dialogue option will not open up until after you leave the tomb. Levels Reward   1–9 500   10–19 750   20–29 1,000   30–39 1,250   40+ 1,500"

Enter Angarvunde Catacombs to open the gate. Enter Angarvunde Ruins to open the gate. Follow Medresi into the treasure chamber. Discover Angarvunde's treasure.","Angarvunde[edit] Upon entering Angarvunde, you will encounter Medresi Dran complaining about her cowardly work force who fled as soon as they encountered some undead. Until the path is clear, Medresi is unable to reach the treasure she seeks. If you offer to assist her, she will in turn offer to split the treasure with you. First, Medresi needs the three leveled draugr cleared from the main chamber. Head down the ramp from Medresi and follow a short corridor; the main chamber is the first large room you come across. Kill the three draugr here and make your way back to Medresi, who will be walking down towards you. Tell her that the draugr are dead, and she will race off to the main chamber. Follow her to the locked gate at the far side of the chamber. Talk to her, and she will give you a key that will open the doors to the sides of the main chamber. Head up the ramp on the southeast wall of the chamber and open the door to the Catacombs. Angarvunde Catacombs[edit] Follow the path downwards until you reach a broken spiral staircase leading further down. Drop down here, listen to a patrolling draugr to time it when he isn't right there. There is a burial urn next to a broken chair. Follow the path still further down and you will encounter another Draugr in the wide corridor. There is also a trapped chest up the stairs to the left. Another draugr awaits when you turn the corner to the left. There is a bookcase on your left with clutter and a burial urn. You will then encounter a group of four as you follow the corridor into the burial crypt, one is roaming and the other three are upright in alcoves asleep. There is also a locked chest and a random potion. The corridor will open out into an overgrown cavern containing a single draugr, four giant Canis Roots and an unlocked chest, behind the first Canis Root on your left as you enter you will find a Corundun vein as part of the wall. Exit this cavern to the left, in front of you is a random potion, continue following the path. Watch for the dart trap on the floor halfway up the stairs, past a burial urn on your left. There is another dart trap halfway up the second set of stairs. Both traps are easily avoided by waiting for the darts to stop and neither seemed to reset. You can use the second trap to your advantage dealing with the draugr which is patrolling here. You will emerge in yet another overgrown cavern containing two draugr. after turning the corner to the right on the top alcove of the second set of alcoves on the left is a petty soul gem, and just after this on the same side are three burial urns. Turn to the left and the last alcove on the left before the stairs is another burial urn. Half way up the stairs there are a couple more burial urns. Several draugr may awake from their slumber here, so be careful. Make your way through the next two large burial chambers and you will reach the door back to Angarvunde. Just before the door there is an urn on the right and a corner table on the left with a random potion and Wraith's Wedding Dowry book. Head straight to the end of the corridor, past a couple of urns and an unlocked chest and pull the lever. The spikes to your left will lower, allowing you back into the main chamber and opening the first gate. Head up the stairs on the northwest side of the main chamber to access Angarvunde Ruins. Angarvunde Ruins[edit] Follow the winding corridor down two flights of stairs. Directly at the foot of these stairs is a corridor containing four trap triggers on the floor, which will release swinging blades if activated. The next room contains a solitary draugr, and iron door concealing a couple of standard burial urns, and a number of paths blocked off by spikes. There is also a copy of the Illusion skill book Before the Ages of Man on the table. There is also a locked chest behind the table in the corner. Continue through the only available path into a two-leveled chamber containing two draugr. Follow the upper pathway around to the right and jump across the crumbled bridge to reach a magicka poison on a pedestal—be warned, though, that this will release a spike trap from the ceiling. Heading downstairs and up the path will bring you face-to-face with yet another draugr, and eventually will lead you to the other side of one of the blocked paths encountered earlier. Pull the lever here to release two sets of spikes—one containing a locked chest, the other leading you back into the first room. Directly opposite, you will see that the third set of spikes has also retracted. Head down the pathway they have revealed. At the foot of the stairs and round the corner to the left, there is a floor trigger for a battering ram overhead, and another two draugr. Two more draugr will spring from the upright coffins on your left as you enter the next three-leveled chamber. Claim the healing potions between them if you wish. On the opposite side of the room there is an unlocked chest, an urn and a burial urn. Veer right and up the stairs to find a path that will bring you to the third tier of this chamber. One draugr awaits in the center of the bridge. In the room directly beyond the bridge, there is a bookcase to the right containing some potions and leveled armor and three burial urns. Further down the stairs and along the corridor, there is also a leveled weapon, some coins, a ruby (maybe random gem) and a coin purse beneath three black statues in an alcove. Deal with the final draugr on the stairs to the right, at the top of the stairs there is another burial urn next to a brazier. The door leads back to Angarvunde. Once through the door there are a couple of burial urns, and magicka potions on your right, then walking towards the lever to lower the spikes you will pass an urn and an unlocked chest on your left.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ansilvund_(quest)","Enter Ansilvund. Make your way through the ruin. Kill Lu'ah Al-Skaven.","Fjori and Holgeir[edit] During your adventures, you may come across the rare book Of Fjori and Holgeir, the tragic tale of a huntress and a warlord who fell in love fighting each other during a battle between forest clans. They fought to a standstill until her sword broke his axe and his shield dulled her blade, and their love was so obvious that the battle instantly ended and brought peace to the forest. When winter came, a snake bit Holgeir, and Fjori obtained an elixir from Akavir to cure the poison. While she was giving the healing elixir to her loved one, instantly curing him, the snake bit her as well, and Holgeir couldn't save her. Out of grief, he built an ancient tomb and took his own life, hoping to rejoin Fjori in Sovngarde. The Nordic ruin of Ansilvund is hidden in the Velothi Mountains, far north of Riften, and can be reached by following an unmarked path east of Cragslane Cavern. Near the entrance you will find the book about Fjori and Holgeir on a table, protected by a hostile conjurer, hinting at unsolved mysteries inside. The Excavation Site[edit] Enslaved Draugr The first area of Ansilvund is an excavation site, complete with mining equipment, wooden structures, and narrow tunnels. Unfortunately, the site is guarded by hordes of hostile conjurers, necromancers, and  mages accompanied by a huge number of leveled draugr enemies, so be prepared for a long trek. Through the cobwebbed room, if you are undetected, you will witness the unusual sight of two draugr mining the blocked path with a seated warlock overseeing their efforts. Obviously enslaved by the warlock, the two draugr will keep hammering on the wall, for reasons unknown. You can either sneak past them or use the oil on the floor to your advantage, even if it will alert all enemies lurking in the surrounding areas. Regardless of your choice, proceed forward through the door. In the third room, a disembodied voice will echo through the tunnels with a warning: ""I am Lu'ah Al-Skaven. Who are you to disrupt my work? Begone, or I will add you to my army of the dead!"" At the top of the planks, there is another patrolling warlock, and after that is a room with three seated warlocks having a discussion beside a cooking pot and an arcane enchanter. Their conversation provides a bit of explanation on the hard-working draugr enemies you encountered in the previous room: Female: ""I think it's sweet Lu'ah is so worked up over her dead soldier..."" Male: ""Yeah, but raising Draugr to take on both the Imperials and the Stormcloaks? That's just crazy."" Female: ""True, but I'm not going to be the one to try to oppose her..."" If the three warlocks detect you, you will have no choice but to battle them. Proceed forward to the third room, where a beam of blue light will shine down at the corpses, immediately reanimating them. The voice will once again be heard, saying, ""Rise from your graves to defeat this worm!"" Defeat the four draugr enemies and proceed to the next room, but beware the ceiling spike trap. Head to the upper level and take the western path through more narrow tunnels until you reach a room with a conjurer and a flame atronach. Defeat the foes and examine the area to the north where you will find four rotating pillars and a handle. For a bit of investigation, search the table below the pillars for the unique book Lu-ah's Journal. Lu'ah and Saeel[edit] The journal tells the story of yet another tragic love affair, this time between a conjurer named Lu'ah Al-Skaven and her husband Saeel. According to the journal, Saeel died fighting for the Empire against the Thalmor twenty-five years ago. During her grieving period, Lu'ah learned the story of Fjori and Holgeir, which led her to Ansilvund, hoping to transfer Saeel's soul to Holgeir's body. In order to reach the burial chamber, she started reanimating the dead, using them as vessels to clear the way. The puzzle in front of you can be solved in two ways, as it is based on the story of Fjori and Holgeir. The book is conveniently placed next to Lu'ah's Journal and, when examined closely, will reveal the following sentences related to the puzzle: As the Eagle finds its mates, so too did Fjori find hers in Holgeir, and a time of peace came to the clans of the forest. But the Snake came and bit Holgeir, its venom seeping deep into the wound. A Whale greeted Fjori's view as she came over the snow-covered mountains to the coast. But the Snake bit Fjori as she poured the last drop into Holgeir's mouth, and fatigued from her journey, she joined the ancestors immediately. From left to right, turn the pillars to match the words in the book. Alternatively, an easier solution is available, as the correct symbols can be found behind the table, mostly overgrown but still visible. With the pillars in place, pull the handle and the door to Ansilvund Burial Chambers will be accessible. Burial Chambers[edit] ""Rise from your graves to defeat this worm!"" The Chambers area starts off with a crypt filled to the brink with traps, all triggered by pressure plates, so navigate your way to the intersection. Behind the locked gate sits a locked boss-leveled chest and a chain that controls all traps in the area, including the swinging blades you may encounter in the southern tunnel. The next room is large and is divided into two levels. Make sure to read the Illusion skill book 2920, Sun's Dawn, v2 found on a booby-trapped pedestal across the room from the entrance, then locate the four sarcophagi in the southeastern area and claim the Ansilvund Key from the pedestal. As soon as you take the key, a dart trap will trigger, and five draugr enemies will burst out of their coffins while Lu'ah Al-Skaven speaks once again: ""I shall have vengeance for the death of my husband. Rise!"" Defeat the enemies, then head upstairs and use the key to unlock several gates until you reach a wooden door. The next area sees another enslaved draugr hacking away on a wall, overseen by another warlock. Make your way up and through a door until you end up on a narrow bridge with more pressure plates, designed purely to push you off the ledge. Beware of the attacking draugr and make your way into a crypt where another ray of blue light will reanimate another wave of undead enemies while Lu'ah will speak once again: ""I could not raise him, but I will raise an army to avenge his defilement!"" Proceed forward and beware of even more traps until you reach a large iron door, the very entrance to the main burial hall, the location sought out by Lu'ah, and the place where she hoped to reanimate her husband through the body of Holgeir. Apparently, she failed. Showdown[edit] Fjori and Holgeir ""Thank you for releasing us from her spell."" The burial chamber is large and has a dead draugr lying on an altar, right in front of two closed sarcophagi, as well as a dead skeleton on the floor and several oil lanterns hanging from the ceiling. As you approach the altar, Lu'ah Al-Skaven will appear from the shadows, saying: ""They burned his body before I could raise him... it should have been returned to me... You will not stop me from killing those who wage this pointless war!"" With these words the two sarcophagi will burst open and the mummified remains of Fjori and Holgeir will come rushing out, now slaves for the residing, vengeful conjurer. At the same time, Lu'ah Al-Skaven will re-animate the skeleton on the floor, so you will face four enemies at once. Fjori and Holgeir are both strong draugr enemies, and Lu'ah will shower you with a wide array of spells, including Ice Storm and Ice Spike along with the expected conjurer spells and a Grand Healing spell for restoration. If you kill either Fjori and Holgeir, Lu'ah will immediately revive them, so go directly after Lu'ah. When she is dead, Fjori and Holgeir will fall to the ground, and blue rays of light will emerge from their bodies. With the curse finally broken, the ghosts of the two lovers will emerge behind the altar, and they will wholeheartedly thank you: Fjori: ""Thank you for releasing us from her spell."" Holgeir: ""Now we can rest in peace once again. Come Fjori, my love..."" Fjori: ""Take this with our gratitude."" They will both disappear and your reward will be ready on the table behind them: the unique sword Ghostblade. Make sure to pick up the Unusual Gem, then loot Lu'ah Al-Skaven for her key and unlock the northern door. Inside you'll find a boss-leveled chest, the spell tome Transmute Mineral Ore, and a hefty amount of soul gems. Lastly, find the Imperial Condolences letter on the table for a final explanation on what drove Lu'ah Al-Skaven into insanity and why she formed her army of undead allies."

Find the summoning circle east of Skytemple Ruins to summon and defeat three Dremora. Craft the three items using a Forge and Staff Enchanter.","A young mage has perished, her work uncompleted A Dead Mage[edit] This quest will automatically begin upon reading Hyenril's Journal at the Skytemple Ruins north of the College of Winterhold. The ruins are usually swarming with undead skeletons, although these shouldn't pose much of a threat. You must locate the corpse of Hyenril, a dead mage found within one of the ruins. On the table in front of her, you will find Hyenril's Journal along with two broken staves: the Arm of the Moon and the Arm of the Sun. Hidden beneath the table is the Warlock's Mark, a mundane necklace. Reading the journal will identify these items as the property of Hyenril's former master, Ellane, who spent long years attempting to restore the two staves, which were originally created in imitation of the legendary Staff of Chaos but were destroyed by their original creator. It will also reveal that Sigil Stones will be needed to restore the three items and unlock their true power. Take all three items to progress the quest; the Warlock's Mark is small and really can be difficult to see, so you may need to rely on your HUD pointer. Sunken Treasure[edit] Locate the master's watery grave In order to obtain the required Sigil Stones, you will need to track down Ellane's ring of summoning. Unfortunately, Ellane was still wearing this ring when Hyenril shipped her body back home for burial aboard a vessel called the Sea Stallion. Your first stop is the East Empire Company offices in Windhelm, where you will find a letter entitled Loss of the Sea Stallion on a table next to a potion of waterbreathing. The ship apparently sank to the bottom of Pilgrim's Trench off the coast of Skyrim before it delivered its cargo. Head to Pilgrim's Trench and prepare for a deep dive to find Ellane's coffin, which can be found atop a rocky outcropping on the sea floor. Inside you will find a copy of Final Lesson, Master Ellane's Last Words, and the Sovereign Band, an enchanted ring which fortifies your magicka.  The Guardians of the Sigil Stones[edit] The Daedric altar With the ring in hand, you will be directed to a stone Daedric summoning circle on the same island as Skytemple Ruins. You must descend from the peak where the ruins are located and go to the eastern shore of the island to find it. Approach the center of the altar and you will be given the option to summon Daedra. Once you activate it, three Dremora will appear in quick succession, with a new one being summoned each time you defeat the last: Dremora Sehtkynaz, an ice mage who can summon a Frost Atronach, guardian of the Blue Sigil Stone; Dremora Lyrkynaz, a shock mage who can summon a Storm Atronach, guardian of the Green Sigil Stone; and Dremora Sovereign, a fire-wielding warrior who can summon a Flame Atronach, guardian of the Orange Sigil Stone. Survive the encounter, then loot the bodies of the Dremora to obtain the three Sigil Stones needed to restore your items' enchantments. They also each have Daedra Hearts on them. The Warlock's Mark can be reforged at any forge or anvil. The Arm of the Moon and Arm of the Sun require access to a Staff Enchanter; in the base game, the only one in existence is located behind a locked door in Tel Mithryn and can only be accessed after you complete the quest Reluctant Steward. You can avoid this prerequisite if you have access to a Staff Enchanter elsewhere, such as the one added by the Myrwatch or Bloodchill Manor Creations.

Acquire the staff that Enthir sold. Return to Arniel.   Part 4 Talk to Arniel in the Hall of Countenance. Talk to Enthir. Retrieve item. Watch Arniel's experiment.","Part 1[edit] Talk to Arniel Gane and ask if there is any College business you can assist him with. He'll state that it's nothing official, but he is working on a ""project"". He refuses to say anything about it, but he asks you to bring him ten Dwemer cogs. They can be found randomly throughout any and all Dwarven ruins. If you have not already found a Dwarven ruin, Alftand is near the College of Winterhold, and the ruin under Markarth is easy to find and lower-level friendly. There are plenty of Dwemer cogs inside Dwemer Museum in Understone Keep, specifically in the closest right corner from the entrance; with stealthy movement, all cogs can be obtained without any repercussions, making this the easiest and quickest method. The main College quest line will take you to Mzulft, which also has more than ten Dwemer cogs. Depending on the ruins and your carry capacity (cogs weigh 10 each) you may end up needing two or three trips to get all the cogs. Once you have obtained the ten Dwemer cogs, return to Arniel and he will reward you with a small amount of gold. Part 2[edit] Arniel needs a very specific item for his project and is having trouble getting Enthir to give it to him. He'd like you to speak to Enthir and return to him with the item. Speaking to Enthir reveals that the item Arniel wants never belonged to him and is Enthir's property. He agrees to relinquish it, though—if you'll retrieve the Staff of Tandil he sold to an unscrupulous character. The character is a boss level caster in a radiantly assigned dungeon. Depending on which one you get the quest may be increasingly more or less difficult. Some of the dungeons, such as Boulderfall Cave and Cragwallow Slope, are extremely small while others might be rather involved or of a difficult nature. The staff should be either on the boss level caster, somewhere nearby, or in the boss level chest. Once you have the staff, return to Enthir. He'll give you the warped soul gem, which can then be returned to Arniel to proceed with the quest.

He will say that it is going terribly. He reveals that he is trying to simulate the disappearance of the Dwemer but the warped soul gem that you acquired for him needs to be charged. Unfortunately, the apparatus he was using to charge it was destroyed in the process and he has no time to build another. Thus, he is only too happy to accept your generous offer to charge it for him. Arniel tells you that the Dwemer used to use convectors to charge their soul gems and that some of these devices probably still exist among Dwarven ruins. He needs two more charges after his own initial charge to power the gem. Due to the nature of the warped soul gem, it will destroy the convector it is charged in. What you need to do is find a few Dwemer convectors and place the warped soul gem inside. He will teach you a spell called Arniel's Convection that must be channeled onto the Dwemer convector until the stone is charged. Keep channeling the convector until the quest updates. You will then have to find a new convector and repeat this process up to two times. There seems to be some variance on whether it takes one to three times to fully charge the stone and use of dual casting can complicate the matter. There are six Dwemer convectors in all of Skyrim: Druadach Redoubt: Across the river from it in an unmarked ruin, east-northeast of the map marker. Deep Folk Crossing: Across the bridge from it at an unmarked ruin, just north of the map marker. Dwarven Storeroom: Simple freestanding Dwarven structure near Mzulft. No enemies. Mzulft: Near the entrance in  the first rooms after the hall, just before the second incline. Must have started Revealing the Unseen. Ruins of Bthalft: Exterior only ruins, bandits here. Shor's Stone: Southwest of the village at an unmarked ruin with a single warlock. Two are northward of Karthwasten, one south of Ivarstead, one southwest of Shor's Stone, and two among the ruins of Mzulft. The two northwest of Karthwasten are probably the easiest to use since no enemies spawn at their locations (wild animals may be a nuisance however) and they are relatively close together. One is directly north of Karthwasten, northeast and across the river from Druadach Redoubt. It is at the base of the unmarked Dwemer pillar. If you cross the river and follow it upstream you will come to Deep Folk Crossing. Cross the bridge and the second Dwemer convector will be in front of you. The one south of Ivarstead is at the Ruins of Bthalft and has bandits. The one southwest of Shor's Stone is between there and Autumnshade Clearing and has a rogue mage. At Mzulft, one is inside the storeroom (a separate building to the right of the ruin entrance when you arrive) and the other is within the ruins proper. Part 4[edit] The dead courier Arniel disappearing in a flash of light Unlike previous parts of the quest, about two or three days must pass before continuing. Thereafter, talk to Arniel again. He is often to be found on the upper floor of the Hall of Attainment, but may also be in the Hall of Countenance. Once more, he's used Enthir's services, and once more, you have to pick up the pieces. Talk to Enthir, who is almost always in his room in the Hall of Attainment. He's quite annoyed since he has no idea where the item is—or even what it is, for that matter. He was only tasked with providing transport for it from Morrowind and it simply hasn't arrived. Enthir tells you to go look for the courier somewhere in the east, and marks a location on your map. The precise location of the courier varies. When you finally do locate him, it's immediately apparent why he didn't complete the delivery. Retrieve the blade ""Keening"" from his body and return it to Arniel. He is outraged that it wasn't wrapped properly and amazed that you didn't die when you touched it. By way of explanation, he relates something of the background of Keening and Sunder, the legendary tools of the Dwemer Tonal Architect Lord Kagrenac. Arniel now conducts his experiment in an attempt to figure out how and why the Dwemer disappeared. Striking the warped soul gem with Keening, he finds that it does nothing. He strikes again, gaining no apparent result once more. Having lost his temper, he curses, lashes out a third time... and disappears in a flash of light, never to be seen again. The quest is then unceremoniously updated as complete. Pick up Keening from the floor if you wish (although it seems to have come down in the world somewhat since the Third Era). Summon Arniel's Shade will be added to your spell list automatically.

Retrieve the map from Ancarion at Northshore Landing. Return to Baldor in Skaal Village.","Finding Baldor[edit] If you return to Skaal Village after the quest The Fate of the Skaal, you will overhear a conversation between Fanari and Deor: NOTE: Do not talk to anyone until they finish their conversation—see bugs. ""Something isn't right, Fanari."" Fanari: ""Deor, you must be calm. I'm sure there's a good reason Baldor left us."" Deor: ""Something isn't right, Fanari. I feel it in my bones and I smell it in the air. Baldor wouldn't leave without telling someone."" Fanari: ""Don't worry yourself over nothing, Deor. Do you want a head full of gray hairs before you've seen forty winters?"" Deor: ""It makes my heart heavy that you don't believe me, Fanari. Baldor could be in danger, and you will do nothing. If you won't help me, then I'll ask the All-Maker to send someone else who can."" If you ask Fanari about the missing person, she will just brush it off as another of Deor's crazy ideas, but Deor is quite serious. He will tell you that local blacksmith Baldor Iron-Shaper went missing in the middle of the night. Deor suspects a kidnapping motivated by Baldor's valuable expertise in stalhrim smithing. On the night of his disappearance Deor also saw two elves dragging something away to the ""south and west"", so start your search in that direction. Abandoned Lodge[edit] The abducted blacksmith While Deor's directions could lead you more-or-less anywhere on Solstheim, your compass objective marker will point you directly to an Abandoned Lodge southwest of the Temple of Miraak. The lodge is normally empty, but once you arrive, you'll be attacked by four hostile members of the Thalmor. Dispose of them and loot their bodies for a note from their commander and the key to the lodge. Inside, head into the basement where you will find the scared, tied-up smith in a corner, weeping: ""Help! Somebody! Please, someone, help me!"" and ""I have been taken against my will! I am in need of rescue!"" When you talk to Baldor, he will remember you as the hero who rescued the people of Skaal Village. Despite his wounds, he'll claim he's not hurt. When you ask why the Thalmor abducted him, he'll reply: ""I do not know this word Thalmor, but if you mean the elves, they were trying to learn the secrets of forging Stalhrim. Their leader, an elf named Ancarion, has a map. He says that it shows the location of a hidden source of Stalhrim."" He will then explain what stalhrim is: ""Enchanted ice as hard as iron and cold as death. Stalhrim can be forged into deadly weapons, but the art is known only to smiths of the Skaal."" He will then point you towards a Thalmor ship at the northwestern coast where Ancarion resides. He asks you to retrieve the map as it belongs to the Skaal people. Leave the wounded smith behind and make your way northwest to Northshore Landing. Northshore Landing[edit] When you arrive, a Thalmor soldier will warn you to be careful. Make your way to the ship, and talk to Ancarion. I'm here about the Stalhrim map. ""So you know my purpose here, then? I suppose you must have found that dullard of a blacksmith. Unfortunately for you, my mission here is also a secret. To protect it, I have no choice but to silence you. Now, give me one good reason that I should not kill you where you stand.""

If you have not already done so, and are still in the Skaal village, take Epistolary Acumen from Storn Crag-Strider's body before entering, as it will not be there when you return. Using dragon souls, unlock the remaining words of the Bend Will shout and read the Black Book Waking Dreams, where Miraak was first encountered during the quest The Temple of Miraak. You will be transported to Apocrypha, Hermaeus Mora's plane of Oblivion. Though this area is large, there's little of interest here now that Miraak has departed, only a few pods and tables along the walls. Walk down the path and up the staircase, where Chapter II will be accessible from a pedestal. Chapter II: Preferred Reading—Boneless Limbs[edit] Ascend the stairs and defeat the two seekers. If you make enough noise, you can attract the attention of enemies far above you, but it is unlikely that you will be able to attack each other, so if you need to leave combat, just sneak until they stop looking for you. At the top of the stairs, a copy of the Smithing skill book Heavy Armor Forging is on a table to the right. When you get across the bridge, you can turn right and walk back along the narrow ledge to reach a pod. On the top landing, grab the book On Apocrypha: Boneless Limbs and go up the now-accessible staircase to reach Chapter III. Chapter III: Preferred Reading—Delving Pincers and Prying Orbs[edit] This next area may be a bit tricky to navigate, due to its maze-like structure. Defeat any seeker you encounter and make your way to the other end of the room, where the book Delving Pincers and a copy of the Alchemy skill book Song of the Alchemists lie. There is a pod across from the book pedestal and another down the stairs past it. After picking up Delving Pincers, return to the entrance, where the (previously closed) gate is now open. Activate the scrye and travel down the hall, where you can pick up a copy of the Enchanting skill book Catalogue of Weapon Enchantments from the table. Be careful in the next room, where it is easy to fall off of the edge. If you activate the scrye in this room, a door will open off to the north, revealing a vessel with a bit of loot (there are also pods by the scrye and book pedestal here). Kill the seeker and traverse the narrow walkways to pick up the book Prying Orbs. With the book in your possession, the gate will open, and you can now continue onward to Chapter IV. [Possible spoiler] - For those that want to speed run this chapter (either for fun or to avoid combat) it is easy enough. Good magic resistances allow you to run past the Seekers and an atronach spell or staff will distract them. Instructions below 1.You need to get the books ' Delving Pincers' and 'Prying Orbs', both to open gates and for the next chapter. From the chapter start, there is a corridor in front of you facing roughly East. Just in front you on the right wall (South) of the corridor is a closed gate [1] that you need to open. 2. Get 'Delving Pincers' - Follow the corridor (E) to a T junction.  Two Seekers will appear. Go right(S), left(E), right, left (passing a poison pools with tentacles and a blue Magicka font). There is a poison pool to your front right and steps up to platform on your left. Go up the steps to a raised platform. On the right is a table with some loot. More importantly, on the left is the book 'Delving Pincers'. Taking this opens gate [1]. There are further steps down to a dead end and a pod (not essential, if you want to run). 3. Run back the way you came. Just before the start, now on your left is the gate [1] open. Go through, activate a scrye which opens a corridor directly in front of you (S). Run down a slope, then up to a table with some loot and a font of stamina. 4. Get 'Prying Orbs' - Turn right and a gate opens to a huge open area with narrow walkways and drops to the chamber below (Chapter 2). It is patrolled by (one or two) Seekers. To your left is a scrye. To your right is a small gated room with loot. The scrye opens the room but neither are essential. Prying orbs is across the entire chamber. It is to your SW, beside a bright blue font. To get to it turn right and take the first (left) path to the middle of the open area. Then take the first left path towards the blue font. and take the book. 5. As you take the book, you are facing NW and you will see a gate open (right in front of you on the other side of the open area. Run over to it across the pathways (dodging the Seeker shots) and down a short corridor is the book to the next chapter. Chapter IV: Preferred Reading—Gnashing Blades[edit] Eliminate the seekers and walk down the stairs to either side of you. There is a pod on a ledge to your right. At the bottom, you will enter a hallway that has a fork to the right. Walking into either hallway will cause it to compress and summon a group of seekers. After you find that both hallways are a dead end, you can turn around and see that, where you had entered, there is a hallway that had not been there previously. Follow it to the next room. Climb the stairs and pick up the book Gnashing Blades. This will open a second path to the right, directly across from where you entered. Continue down the hallway as it extends outward and take a left turn at its end. In this next room, follow the path until you reach a scrye. Activate it and go back to the same hallway you came from—it has shifted and leads to a room with a small pool of poisonous water. From the pool will rise a lurker. When the room is clear, activate the scrye to the left of the closed gate and go around a corner at the far end of the room (across from the previously mentioned closed gate). Here, activate the second scrye and examine the room next to it, which had been opened by the first scrye, for any valuables. You can find Chapter V through the gate opened by the second scrye. Chapter V: The Penultimate Chapter[edit] The hallway will lead you to a large open room with a pillar in the middle emitting a green light. Defeat the seekers. Surrounding the central pillar are four pedestals with inscriptions. On the walls near the eye and tentacle pillars, there are three pods. Place the four books that were collected in the previous Chapters on the appropriate pedestal: Boneless Limbs is placed on the 'tentacle' symbol (NE) Delving Pincers is placed on the 'pincer' symbol (SE) Prying Orbs is placed on the 'eye' symbol (NW) Gnashing Blades is placed on the 'fangs' symbol (SW) Once all four books are placed correctly, the book located in front of the central pillar will glow. This will take you to Chapter VI. Chapter VI: Bending the Will of Sahrotaar, First and Last and Always[edit] A copy of the Destruction skill book The Art of War Magic is located to the right of the entrance, while at the left, there is a pod with some valuable loot. The path will take you to a large open area surrounded by water. Kill the two seekers and approach the word wall, which teaches a word for the Dragon Aspect shout. Sahrotaar, a serpentine dragon, will attack you; however, you are tasked with taming it using Bend Will. Using the full shout on Sahrotaar (be sure to unlock all three words) will instantly tame him. He will land and offer to take you to Miraak. Mount Sahrotaar and fly to the large tower circled by dragons, but not before forcing you to fight enemies on another platform. After you kill the two Seekers and the Lurker, Sahrotaar will fly towards Miraak's Tower. As you reach the top, Miraak will chide Sahrotaar for being so easily swayed by your thu'um. Once you land, approach Miraak, who will explain that his time in Apocrypha is done, and that although you are powerful, you are still subject to Miraak's power. Miraak will then conclude that the final key for his escape is your soul, and with it he will be strong enough to return to Solstheim. The death of Miraak Miraak absorbing a dragon soul The conversation will quickly end and the battle will commence. It is completely up to you as to how you would like to battle, either on the back of Sahrotaar or on foot. However, be careful of the other dragons trying to attack you. As Miraak's health is weakened, he will enter an invulnerable state and return to full health. Each time he regenerates, he will sacrifice a dragon: first Kruziikrel, then Relonikiv. The third regeneration will lead to Sahrotaar's demise, as Miraak absorbs his soul, too. With all three dragons eliminated, you can deal the final blows to Miraak. When his health is low enough, he will move to the center of the area in an attempt to escape. At this point, Hermaeus Mora will intervene, claiming that Miraak can hide nothing from him in his realm. The Daedric Prince then impales Miraak with a tentacle, and explains to Miraak that his death is insignificant, as he has found a new Dragonborn to 'serve' him. As Miraak dies, he wishes upon you the same fate he is about to suffer, and then disintegrates into nothing but bones as his soul departs from his body and is absorbed by you. For Miraak's death, you will be rewarded with at least six dragon souls (additional number of dragon souls is equal to the number of dragons you've killed in the plug-in, regardless of whether their souls are stolen by Miraak or not) and you may loot his body for his equipment, as well as the bodies of the dragons. Reading the Black Book Waking Dreams will allow you to gain access to your skill trees (see the notes section). Read the book once more to exit Apocrypha.  Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: At the Summit of Apocrypha (40 points/Silver) Reaching the end of Waking Dreams counts as one of the five black books for this achievement: Hidden Knowledge (40 points/Bronze) If this is the first time you've fully traversed Waking Dreams you may earn the last word of the Dragon Aspect shout and thus this achievement: Dragon Aspect (20 points/Silver)"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Awakening","Speak to Isran. Travel to Dimhollow Crypt to find out what the vampires are after. Solve the puzzle. Speak to the Mysterious Woman.","Activating the button Dimhollow Crypt[edit] For a more detailed walkthrough of Dimhollow Crypt, see the place page. After speaking to Isran, make your way across Skyrim to Dimhollow Crypt, which lies high in the mountains east of Morthal. To reach it, head directly east of Frostmere Crypt until you reach a southbound path up the mountain or alternatively start at the Shrine of Mehrunes Dagon and follow the dirt path that skirts the cliff face east. As you enter the first room you will overhear two vampires conversing over the body of Vigilant Tolan and two of their kin. Dispose of the vampires and the accompanying death hound and head inside the ruined tower to the southwest, where you will find a pull-chain. This opens the gate near the bodies and allows you to progress further. Make your way through the ruins, battling vampires and skeletons  as you go along. You will eventually arrive in a larger room where a vampire and its death hound are battling some draugr. Mop up the survivors and head to the westernmost of the four pull-chain-opened gates in the room. In the next chamber, a vampire is sat high up on a stone ledge and three skeletons will rise up from the water in the middle of the room. Navigate the honeycomb crypts further beyond, which contain the corpses of a few frostbite spiders as well as two very much alive vampires and their death hounds. In the final section of the crypt you will find a vampire fighting a wounded frostbite spider behind a closed gate. Wait for one to prevail before opening the gate by pulling the lever nearby, dispatching the victor and heading into Dimhollow Cavern. Awakening[edit] The puzzle solved As you enter Dimhollow Cavern you will overhear the vampire Lokil interrogating Vigilant Adalvald, who will die before revealing anything to his captor. After Adalvald dies, Lokil, his thrall, and an accompanying vampire will become hostile towards you as soon as they detect you. Use your starting position on a balcony overlooking the vampires to snipe down at them. You can also close the gate to the balcony behind you by pulling a lever inside, giving you some respite from the fight if needed. After killing the vampires, make your way to the circular stone structure that dominates this chamber. Pressing the button atop the pedestal in the center will cause a spike to emerge, impaling your hand as a purple light shines up from troughs in the floor. Push each of the movable braziers into or away from the center of the circle so that they touch the end of the purple light within their path, causing the pattern to expand towards the next brazier, until you connect them all. The center of the structure will then descend to reveal a stone monolith beneath the pedestal, which contains a mysterious woman carrying an Elder Scroll. Upon speaking to the woman, she will tell you that her name is Serana and that she is a vampire. She will ask you to take her to her family home, Castle Volkihar, northwest of Solitude. Asking her a few questions will reveal that she is not very trusting of you, but she does reveal that she has been imprisoned for a very long time, since even before the rise of the First Empire of Cyrodiil (i.e., about 4,200 years before current events). Once you finish your conversation with her, the quest completes and the next one begins. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: AwakeningDG (20 points/Bronze)"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:An_Axe_to_Find","Speak to Glover Mallory in Raven Rock. Retrieve his ancient Nordic pickaxe from Crescius Caerellius. Return to Glover Mallory.","That Foolish Old Man[edit] The blacksmith of Raven Rock, Glover Mallory, has plenty of problems, both with his affiliation with the Thieves Guild in Riften and his messy family affairs. Additionally, he's got a problem with an eighty year old ex-miner who borrowed his ancient Nordic pickaxe and forgot to give it back. Locate Glover Mallory near his smithy in the center of town and he will ask, ""You haven't seen  Crescius Caerellius have you? That foolish old man's taken my pickaxe again!"" He will then explain that it's not an ordinary pickaxe, but a rarity in Solstheim. Since Glover has some shady business going on he will refuse to call the guards and will tell you, ""Um, I prefer to handle these things on my own. Look, if you see Crescius, tell him to give me that pickaxe back and I'll pay you for the trouble."" You can then ask what the pickaxe is good for and he will readily explain that it's the only tool able to crack stalhrim and that he traded that pickaxe with residents from Skaal Village. The Damn Fool[edit] Seek out Crescius Caerellius. If you have yet to finish The Final Descent you can find him around the clock inside Raven Rock Mine and you will have to initiate said quest before he will discuss the pickaxe. Otherwise, he will have returned to his daily routine and can be found either at home or in the mine. When you mention the pickaxe, he will immediately say, ""The damn fool doesn't even deserve to have it! The pickaxe was made for mining, not selling. I'll bet he stole it from the Skaal in the first place."" Note: If you already have an Ancient Nordic Pickaxe in your inventory, you may not be able to open any dialogue with Crescius about it, preventing you from advancing the quest. If this happens, simply drop, store or sell the one in your inventory until after you have gotten beyond the above dialogue with him. Once Crescius has enabled the dialogue about the pickaxe and responded to your inquiry as outlined above, you will have three reply options available, and the reward will differ depending on your decision: Option  Dialogue  Result   ""It doesn't belong to you."" ""Oh, very well. Here. Tell him I hope he drops the thing on his foot."" Return to Glover Mallory with the axe.   ""Fine, you keep it."" ""Now you're finally talking some sense. A mining tool belongs in a mining family. Just tell him I lost it or something."" Return to Glover Mallory and lie.   ""Let me think about this."" ""Good. Now let me get back to what I was doing."" Nothing. The Two Rewards[edit] If you chose the first option, return to Glover and tell him you have his pickaxe, which he will then let you keep as a reward: ""So you finally tracked down old Crescius, eh? Quite a character, isn't he. Tell you what. Since you went through all the trouble of finding it for me and all, you keep it."" He will then tell you why: ""I just wanted to remind that codger you can't just go around taking things from other people. Now that you've delivered the message, I'm satisfied. Besides, that pickaxe hasn't done me any good in years. Maybe you can put it to good use."" If you chose the second option, he will be quite bitter about the whole thing but will still hand you a leveled amount of gold: ""Blast! That careless old fool. Well, thanks for trying anyway. Here you go... for your trouble."" Levels Reward   1–9 250   10–19 400   20–29 500   30–39 600   40+ 750"

He will explain his fascination with the staffs of Azra Nightwielder, the original Shadowmage, and will reveal that he has located one such staff in a random dungeon. The location is radiant, and can include dungeons both on Solstheim and in Skyrim. Skyrim is far more likely, as there are considerably more potential locations there.

Return to Ri'saad for your reward.","There are a total of four bandit camps to track down To begin the quest, locate the Khajiit trader Ri'saad. He and his caravan often travel through Skyrim, but will stop for several days outside major cities such as Whiterun or Markarth. Upon locating him, you will have a new dialogue option to ask about the trouble his caravan has been running into. Wishing to remain discreet, he will give you a note, which explains the situation. As the note states, recently his caravan has been beset by strange new bandits at two locations: one near North Brittleshin Pass and another near Fort Kastav. The only other information he can provide is that one group wears gleaming golden armor while the other wears dark armor. Tracking down the two camps, you will find each location containing 3-4 bandits and a cage. Each group's leader will have a journal indicating the location of the leader of their respective gang, along with a key to the camp's cage. Inside each cage is an Elytra Nymph that you can talk to and obtain as a pet. Obtaining both pets will complete their respective miscellaneous quests. At the first Saints bandit camp, be sure to loot and read the Notes on the Blacksmith off the corpse of the Saints Bandit Leader to begin a quest to unlock Golden and Dark smithing. At the first Seducers bandit camp is a knapsack containing the Bandit's Note on Hidden Treasure; reading it will start the miscellaneous quest to unlock a Daedric artifact. Using the information from the bandit leader journals, locate and kill the true gang leaders: Kinthal for the Saints and Svarig for the Seducers. Be sure to loot the two unique soul gems at the altar where Kinthal is located. Combining the information from both journals will explain that the bandit gangs were funded by a wizard named Thoron, and that he seems to be hiding out in the sewers beneath Solitude. Reading either of the leader's journals will start the next quest, Restoring Order, although you must read both journals to discover Thoron's exact location. With this information in hand, return to Ri'saad and let him know the two groups are no longer a danger. He will thank you and reward you with 300 gold, thus completing the quest."

Clear the fort of Stormcloak rebels. Report the news to General Tullius.","Receiving the Quest[edit] After completing A False Front, report for duty again to Legate Rikke at the Pale Imperial Camp. Having learned that the Stormcloak-held Fort Dunstad is in need of reinforcements, she will command you to help to take the fort while it is vulnerable. She will instruct you to rendezvous with a task force of Imperial soldiers who are staging near the fort, southeast of your location. She will mark the meeting point on your map, and you will update your journal to note this objective. Join the Men Attacking the Fort[edit] A Route to the Rendezvous Point    Walk westward out of the camp until you encounter a paved road running north-south. This can be difficult to see when visibility is poor. If you see it, turn left onto it; otherwise, head south from a short distance west of the camp, bearing to the east if necessary to navigate past obstacles. If you are following the paved road, you will pass two rocky areas to your left. There is an easily found iron ore vein in the second of these.   You will soon reach another paved road. Turn left on this. After a moderate distance, the road will take you on a significant descent down the mountain. Keep your eye on the paving stones to avoid losing your way. Eventually, the pavement will end at a T-intersection with the major road running between Whiterun and Dawnstar. Turn right onto this, heading upwards again. Follow this road generally south, around a few bends alternatively to the south and east, until you come upon the task force. A group of legionnaires preparing to converge on the fort As you approach the waiting soldiers, they will charge toward the fort. Your objective becomes to take it over from the rebels. As your team engages the Stormcloaks holding the fort, you will receive regular updates on the percentage of enemies remaining. Take Fort Dunstad[edit] The entire battle will take place in the exterior areas of the fort. If you have not yet developed an eye for distinguishing between Imperial friendlies and rebel enemies, the Stormcloaks are easily identified by their pointed helmets. The battle will comprise multiple pairs and small clusters of engagements, with both sides using melee weapons and archery attacks. These engagements occur at multiple points in the two courtyard-like areas, and along the elevated wooden platforms around the semi-perimeter. If you let them, your group will essentially take care of the battle for you. If you hang back and take the most passive approach to the fight, you may need only to restore your health once or twice when you are targeted. If you want to prioritize acquiring weapons and armor off of fallen soldiers, you should search them quickly because their bodies will disappear shortly after falling. Often, there are actually some Stormcloaks remaining (or respawning) after the battle has been formally won, which you can engage and loot. Also, if you so wish, you may kill the remaining Imperials as well in order to loot them without getting a bounty. When it's reported that all the rebels have been killed, you will have completed the objective of taking the fort and the quest itself. Hidden by the game, Rikke will have already moved to the next Imperial Camp (usually Rift Imperial Camp) and if you approach her she will reward you with a leveled amount of gold (this is not recommended tho as it causes a bug during Compelling Tribute). If you don't go to her before reporting to General Tullius she will not give you the leveled gold reward for this quest. Reward[edit] Levels Reward   1–9 400   10–19 600   20–29 800   30–39 1,000   40+ 1,200 Report to General Tullius[edit] Your objective then becomes to report to General Tullius at Castle Dour to receive your reward, but doing so technically occurs under the overarching Reunification of Skyrim quest.

Make your way to the gates to Solitude to hear Ulfric's speech. After the speech, everyone will run into Solitude. Follow them in and fight your way to Castle Dour. If facing problems coping with the Imperial soldiers, it would be a good idea to stick with Ulfric. There will be several wooden barricades littering the city—three hits or less from a weapon or Destruction spell will break them. The gate to the courtyard will be closed, so you will have to go around the city to get to Castle Dour. Negotiation at its finest[edit] Once you've had enough fighting, enter Castle Dour. Galmar and Ulfric will appear inside with you. You will be put in a cutscene mode for a few seconds while Ulfric tells Galmar to secure the door. Head through the doorway with Galmar and Ulfric to confront General Tullius and Legate Rikke. A lengthy dialogue commences, and despite Ulfric's pleas that she surrender, Rikke insists on standing her ground and engages in combat. Kill Rikke and beat Tullius into submission. Once Rikke is dead and Tullius is on the floor, the fighting will stop, and a short conversation will occur. After some talking, Galmar and Ulfric will offer to give you the honor of finishing Tullius.  Choose whether to accept their offer or decline and allow Ulfric to kill the General. If you choose to kill Tullius then Ulfric will give you a leveled sword with which to do the deed.  If you decline then he will reward you with a leveled sword after he kills Tullius.  This will complete the quest and begin the final stage of the Liberation of Skyrim.

Talk to Jarl Balgruuf the Greater after his speech.","Battle for Whiterun[edit] The Burning City[edit] The Burning City At the end of Message to Whiterun, report to Legate Quentin Cipius and he will tell you the latest news about the Stormcloaks and give you your new orders: ""The Stormcloaks are here. In force. Get down to the front line. This is it. We must hold the city. Move it!"" Upon leaving Dragonsreach, you will find Whiterun under siege by Stormcloak catapults. Along the city wall of the Plains District, the Imperial Legion will be returning fire with their own catapults. The streets will be busy with citizens running back to their houses and city guards making ready to fight the enemy. Whiterun will suffer great destruction during the battle. Severio Pelagia will be killed and his home, as well as Heimskr's, will be destroyed. The Bleeding Battlefield[edit] Just outside the city gates, you will find Legate Rikke on the strategically important main entryway, busy addressing a crowd of fully-armed Imperial Soldiers: ""This is it men! This is an important day for the Empire and for the Legion. And for all of Skyrim. This is the day we send a message to Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebel Jarls who support him. But make no mistake. What we do here today, we do for Skyrim and her people. By cutting out the disease of this rebellion, we will make this country whole again! Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion! Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!"" Soon after Rikke finishes her speech, the Stormcloaks will start their attack. Their archers will provide suppression fire from a distance outside the gate, while the main force will move up the main road in groups. First, you need to defend the barricades, then the drawbridge. Finally, you need to kill attacking soldiers until the percentage of attackers remaining drops to zero. Legate Rikke and Hadvar, both of whom are essential and cannot be killed, will give you a hand during the defense, so stay close to one or both of them if you are having difficulty. The united force of Whiterun guards and Imperial soldiers will take advantage of the fortifications and draw the attention of many enemies. Don't worry if you are unable to defend the barricades or drawbridge. It does not affect the ending of the quest or your reward. When the percentage of remaining attackers drops to zero, the battle will be over and this quest will be complete. Any surviving Stormcloaks will lose heart and flee the battlefield. This starts an unnamed miscellaneous quest with the objective Report to the Jarl of Whiterun. Also, completion of Battle for Whiterun automatically starts the next quest Reunification of Skyrim. Report to the Jarl of Whiterun[edit] The Inspiring Speech[edit] The Inspiring Speech Irileth will tell everyone to follow her, as Jarl Balgruuf the Greater wishes to speak. You may listen to his speech after the combat: ""Revel in your victory here today, even as the gods revel in your honor! They already sing of your valor and skill! The halls of Sovngarde are no doubt ringing with your praises! In defeating these Stormcloak traitors, you have proven the hollowness of their cause and the fullness of your hearts. The citizens of Whiterun are forever in your debt! But Ulfric will not stop here. No, he will continue to strike out against any true Nord who remains faithful to the Empire. He will continue to sow discord and chaos wherever he can. And so, we must each one of us, continue to fight this insurrection, lest our fallen brothers have died for naught! Lest our honor be lessened should we allow these bloodthirsty beasts to prowl our lands! Carry on men, my gratitude and blessings go with you! For Whiterun! For the Empire!"" At the end of his speech, you may talk to him. The jarl will thank you and grant you the privilege of buying a house in his city, if you haven't already: ""Thank you for your role in all of this. It'd be my honor should you decide to make Whiterun your home. Speak with Proventus. He'll make the necessary arrangements."". This completes the miscellaneous quest. Reward[edit] As part of the next quest, Reunification of Skyrim, when you return to General Tullius in Solitude, he commends you for the victory and gives you the rank of Quaestor, along with a leveled enchanted weapon."

Defeat Jarl Balgruuf the Greater.","Making it to the Gates[edit] The Whiterun guard have stationed themselves atop the walls in order to defend the city... After finishing the previous quest, Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak will tell you that you are going to help take Whiterun. Report to Galmar Stone-Fist for orders, who will direct you to meet him outside the city. At this point, the Whiterun and Dragonsreach icons will disappear from the map and the city will not be reachable via fast travel for the duration of this quest, even if a house is owned or if you have a spouse in Whiterun. Only the surroundings of the city can be reached via fast travel, or you can use a Carriage from Windhelm to get there by asking Alfarinn, it will cost you 20 gold, however if you choose this option. Head to the Whiterun Military Camp, southwest of Whiterun, and you will notice that the besieging of Whiterun has already begun. Head to where Galmar is briefing the men on the attack and listen in. He will say your destination is the drawbridge that has been raised to keep the attackers out. Once the rallying of the troops is done, charge in with Galmar and the troops. Don't worry too much about killing all the Imperials, as more spawn. When you reach the first set of wooden barricades is also when you meet the first enemies. Breaking through the barricades is easy. Hit them a few times with a weapon and they break. Your journal will then tell you to lower the drawbridge. Move up the path to the small wooden bridge with the stone walls to your side, head up there, and go up the walkway. You will see two drawbridge levers over the drawbridge. Pull one. The bridge will fall, and the soldiers will run into the city.  Inside the City[edit] ...which is quickly overwhelmed by the Stormcloaks. Head into the city. Your destination now is Dragonsreach (It may be safer to stay with Galmar and the soldiers). Several barriers block the entrance to the plains district, which are destroyed after 3 blows from any weapon (power attacks make no difference). Upon entering Dragonsreach, three soldiers will charge at you, but they will die easily. Continue up the stairs, where Balgruuf will shout about not letting you take the city without fighting back. Then he, three guards, and his Housecarl, Irileth, will attack you. Kill the soldiers. After the jarl is reduced to 25% health, he will stop the fight and surrender. Vignar Gray-Mane will approach the jarl and they will have a short conversation. Galmar will stop the conversation after a while, Vignar will walk off after a few more words and Balgruuf will address you for a minute. With Balgruuf stepping down, Vignar takes the throne as the new Jarl of Whiterun. The quest will end there and the next quest, Liberation of Skyrim, will begin. When you return to Ulfric Stormcloak in Windhelm, he commends you for the victory and rewards you with an enchanted leveled weapon and gives you the title ""Ice-Veins""."

Ulfric thinks he can hide behind the walls of his castle. But we will fight our way in and drag him out through the rubble to face justice. Because this is the end for them, the Stormcloaks will fight like cornered rats. They will be fierce and crafty. But they are no match for Legionnaires.

Men who distinguish themselves will be well rewarded. Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion! Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!""

Battle for Windhelm[edit] Once inside, you will be met by wave after wave of infinitely respawning Stormcloak Soldiers. Your task now will be to fight your way through the opposition to reach the Palace of the Kings. Debris will block the direct route to the palace, forcing you to find another way. After entering the city, take an immediate left and head west to the market square. Upon reaching the square, turn right past the blacksmith's forge and travel north to the cemetery. Once there, take a left down the steps, then take the steps north past the Hall of the Dead. Upon reaching the top of the steps and smashing the barricade, march through Valunstrad and head east down the alley. Once you reach the end of the alley, turn left and head north up the steps, destroy the barricade, and proceed to the Palace of the Kings, where Ulfric and his second in command, Galmar Stone-Fist, are waiting for you. Palace of the Kings[edit] When you enter the palace, Ulfric will be sitting on his throne with Galmar standing by his side. General Tullius and Legate Rikke will enter, and Tullius will demand Ulfric's surrender, stating that Ulfric is the only one standing between Skyrim and peace and that he needs to be killed to regain the peace. After they're done talking, Ulfric and Galmar will become hostile and attack the three of you. Kill Galmar and force Ulfric to his knees (Ulfric is still essential at this point). If you are having trouble with this battle, you can allow Tullius and Rikke to do most of the fighting, as they are both essential. General Tullius will then prepare to kill Ulfric, but Ulfric will request that his death be at your hands. You will then be given the choice of executing Ulfric or making Tullius do it himself. If you choose to kill Ulfric, Tullius will hand you a leveled enchanted sword for the task, though you don't need to use the sword to kill Ulfric. If you choose to let the general kill Ulfric he will still give you the sword afterwards. After Ulfric is dead, Tullius and Rikke will head outside. Follow them out and watch as Tullius gives a speech to the assembled Imperial soldiers, thanking them for their service. After the completion of this quest, the Imperials will install a new Jarl, Brunwulf Free-Winter. If you later approach him, he will grant you the privilege of buying property in Windhelm and, if you speak to him, the opportunity to become Thane of Eastmarch. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked at the end of this quest if you sided with the Imperials: Hero of Skyrim (30 points/Silver) — Capture Solitude or Windhelm - If you sided with the Stormcloaks, Windhelm is only the first step, and the achievement is instead obtained with the Battle for Solitude."

Speak to Adventus Caesennius or Yrsarald and loot all items from the nearby chest. Make your way to the battlefield east of Whiterun and kill all enemy soldiers. Loot the Champion's body to complete the quest.","Become a Champion[edit] You may have to take out the competition... Note: This stage of the quest is only available if you install the Civil War Champions Creation on a character that has not yet sided with the Imperial Legion or the Stormcloaks. Go to The Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun. On the counter inside, you will find a note called Battle of Champions, which describes an upcoming battle between the Legion and the Stormcloaks in the ongoing Civil War. Both sides intend to nominate a Champion, but nobody has been chosen as of yet. If you wish to side with the Legion, you must journey to Castle Dour in Solitude to speak with Legate Adventus Caesennius. Although the note states that the Legion will accept ""any willing soldier"", you will need to pass a Persuasion check (Speech 50) to convince him to let you act as the Legion Champion. If your Speech skill is not particularly high, it would be wise to bring a Fortify Persuasion potion with you. Once you persuade him, you will be handed the Imperial Armory Key to unlock a chest in the nearby equipment room. If you instead wish to fight for the Stormcloaks, you must bring five snow bear pelts to Yrsarald Thrice-Pierced in the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm. These can be taken from snow bears or purchased from hunters and general goods merchants starting at level 10, although at low levels you may have difficulty with this task. Luckily there is an alternative and more underhanded approach: the note mentions a prospective Champion named Klija Wolf-Claw who wishes to fight for the Stormcloaks. She has already gathered the pelts and can be found at the small settlement of Kynesgrove just south of Windhelm. She can be found at all hours at the Steamscorch Mine Camp and carries an item named Klija's Snow Bear Pelts on her person. It can be a challenge to pickpocket the item from her, but be warned that killing her counts as murder and will land you with a significant bounty if you are caught. Whichever way you go about obtaining enough pelts, speak with Yrsarald to receive the Storm-Bear Chest Key unlocking a chest in the Palace's war room. Answer the Call[edit] Note: This stage of the quest is only available if you install the Creation on a character which has already joined the Legion or the Stormcloaks. If you're already a member of the Legion or the Stormcloaks, you will receive a letter by courier [verification needed — see talk page] from your commanding officer, advising you that a challenge has been issued by the Stormcloaks and requesting your assistance in dealing with it. If you are a member of the Legion, you will receive a Letter from the Empire requesting that you speak with Legate Adventus Caesennius in Castle Dour to receive your custom forged equipment for this task. If you are a Stormcloak, you will instead receive a Letter from the Stormcloaks asking you to meet with Yrsarald Thrice-Pierced in the Palace of the Kings. Meet with your commanding officer to receive a key to a nearby chest. Prepare for Battle[edit] Approach your fellow Champion Whichever path you take, once you are named Champion you will need to unlock the relevant chest and loot every item within. The quest will not progress unless you take everything, so be sure to pick up both weapons even if you only mean to use one. The chest also contains the Map of Battle Location, which can be examined in your inventory if you wish. The quest marker will direct you to the battle location in any case, a clearing on the plains of Whiterun Hold directly west of Shimmermist Cave. When you arrive, you will find five soldiers from both sides facing off against each other, with the other Champion patiently waiting for you in the center. If you side with the Legion, the Champion will be Klija Wolf-Claw if you didn't steal her pelts, but if you stole her pelts you will face a generic Stormcloak Champion instead. If you side with the Stormcloaks you will face a generic Imperial Champion. Speak with the other Champion to begin the battle. You will need to slaughter all enemy combatants and loot the fallen Champion for their gear in order to complete the quest. You may have issues with encumbrance at this stage if you intend to bring all this equipment away with you. Both sets of items are extremely powerful and make for a worthy reward. After the completion of the quest, you will receive a Letter of Commendation (either the Legion version or Stormcloak version) via courier from your commanding officer to congratulate you on your victory."

The purpose of these small side jobs is to help the Guild rebuild and retake their influence around Skyrim. Ask him for a bedlam job and he will explain: ""Sometimes we like to remind a city that we mean business, so we hit it hard. Just steal whatever we can until we've made an impression. Simple right? Almost. The catch is it doesn't count if anyone sees you take it. The message needs to be clear; we work in the shadows. Steal from anywhere in the hold, and you even get to keep everythin' you stole. So, you in?"" A State of Bedlam[edit] If you accept the job, Delvin will name one of the five major cities in Skyrim, although you can actually steal from anywhere in the specified hold. Raven Rock in Solstheim can also be a target for the job if Dragonborn is installed (see bugs).

If you are caught by the guards, the job is forfeited. There is no penalty from the Thieves' Guild; only the inconvenience of being imprisoned, and paying an out-of-pocket fine. You may begin the job again at any time, once you speak with Delvin. Additionally, if you want to quit the job, whether to acquire a different job or a different city, you can tell Delvin at any time. He grumbles, but there is no actual penalty, no matter how many jobs you quit.

You can now explore the area and advance to Riverwood at your own pace or follow whoever is accompanying you down the path. Following Hadvar or Ralof does not grant any special bonuses, but you do get to listen to your companion comment on the world around you, and they will point out the Guardian Stones and let you pick one that suits you. He will comment differently depending which stone you choose. The Warrior Stone (Hadvar): ""Warrior, good! I knew you shouldn't have been on that cart the minute I laid eyes on you."" The Warrior Stone (Ralof): ""Warrior, good! Those stars will guide you to honor and glory."" The Mage Stone: ""Mage, eh? Well, to each his own. It's not for me to judge.""

Explain your situation and he or she will recommend you seek out the jarl of the region, Jarl Balgruuf the Greater at his palace in Whiterun. They will also offer you what assistance they can (in the form of some low level food, potions, and jewelry) to get you started. Only Gerdur will give a key to her house. If you arrive in Riverwood very late, then the person you're directed to meet won't immediately offer you assistance. If you ask whether you can take any supplies, you will be allowed to take some things, and be directed to see the jarl.  To Whiterun[edit] Head out over the bridge out of town and follow the path north to Whiterun. Upon arrival at the main gate, a guard will tell you the city is closed to visitors. Any one of the dialogue options you are presented with will have him let you in the city, except for trying to intimidate the guard. Once inside, follow the path up to Dragonsreach and enter. When you approach Jarl Balgruuf, his housecarl, Irileth, will ask you why you are interrupting the meeting; any dialogue option will gain you an audience. Speak with Jarl Balgruuf to complete the quest and begin the next. He will reward you with a piece of leveled armor. Whether you receive light or heavy is governed by your aptitude in those skills. If they are equal, Balgruuf will give you heavy armor."

As you arrive at the cave, you will have to pick up and read the journal that is on a plank of wood. The journal mentions a fishing rod of Dwarven make that might be found in Alftand Ruined Tower. Travel to Alftand Ruined Tower and after a short while inside you will find the dead body of Jorid, the fisherman mentioned in the journal. Press the button on the desk near the body, but be careful as it will activate flamethrowers ahead of you while opening the door.

(If not a vampire) Retrieve the Soul Essence Gem. (Misc. objective)","My Mother's Keeper[edit] Serana fighting a Keeper Upon your arrival in the Soul Cairn, follow the quest marker to the Boneyard and find Serana's mother Valerica standing near the entrance. She is initially surprised to find her daughter in the Cairn, before turning her focus on you and your motives for accompanying Serana. Once Serana has interceded for you, Valerica reveals she is still in possession of the Blood Elder Scroll. However, she is trapped in the Boneyard by an invisible barrier after fighting with the Ideal Masters and their minions when first arriving in the Cairn. To release her, she directs you to defeat the three Boneyard Keepers located across the Cairn. The Keepers each live in separate towers, set apart from the main Boneyard and relatively far apart. The easiest way to navigate to them is by following the three quest markers. Alternatively, if you already killed all 3 Keepers before meeting Valerica, she explains what their purpose was, and will thank you for lifting the barrier. Each of the Keepers is accompanied by 1-4 minions (bonemen, mistmen or wrathmen) that will attack you, usually ahead of your encounter with the Keeper. The Keepers themselves may prove quite a challenge to lower level players, so make full use of Serana's fighting capabilities. One possible strategy for the bow-wielding Keeper is to use Unrelenting Force to blast it off the edge of the tower. Dealing with the Dragon[edit] Once the final Keeper is defeated, return to Valerica. The invisible barrier has now been removed, allowing her to lead you into the Boneyard itself. Once inside, the dragon Durnehviir will appear and immediately attack you, supported by a host of bonemen. Once he has been defeated, head to the alcove in the southeast corner, where you will find the Elder Scroll surrounded by a number of potions, ingredients and books. Once you leave the Boneyard from the southwest gate, Durnehviir will rematerialize on top of a nearby stone arch and speak to you, starting his quest. If you tell him you have more pressing matters to attend to, his quest will not begin and you will need to return to him at a later time to initiate it. If you are a vampire, simply head southwest back to the portal; if you are not, see the section below. Scattered Soul[edit] If you are not a vampire and allowed Serana to partially soul trap you in order to enter the Soul Cairn, you will first need to retrieve your soul from a Soul Essence Gem. As Valerica explains, this is located at an offering altar not far away. After exiting the Boneyard from the southwest gate, head west-northwest until you reach a fort-like structure with an entrance on the south side. Follow the winding corridor, dispatching the odd wrathman before emerging into an exterior area. From here head south and east back inside the fort and follow the corridor due north. At the second junction leading east you will find a portal, which takes you outside on the top of the fort. On a raised platform you will find the Soul Essence Gem; once you take it a Black Soul Gem will be added to your inventory and you will start emanating a shaft of bright blue light. Alternatively, you can retrieve the Essence Gem before meeting Valerica, which will immediately result in the negative effect being removed. You can now exit the fort, head south towards the breach in the Cairn walls and then southwest to the portal back to Castle Volkihar.

Before proceeding, loot the pod hidden behind the left-hand statue at the foot of the stairs, as well as the random soul gems and the Sneak Skill Book 'Three Thieves' on the table to the right. Then climb the stairs, claim the contents of a second pod to the left of the doors and the scroll of invisibility beside it. Activate the scrye and deal with two leveled seekers and one leveled lurker, avoiding the whipping tentacles in alternating pools along the path. At the far end of the path, you will climb another set of stairs to a platform, where another leveled lurker will emerge from a pool and attack. After defeating this final foe, climb the last set of stairs to find a vessel, a few soul gems on another stone table, and the Black Book Filament and Filigree. Read the book to choose your reward, then read it again to return to Kolbjorn Barrow. Rewards[edit] Your choice of one of three greater powers: Secret of Strength — Power attacks cost no stamina for 30 seconds. Secret of Arcana — Spells cost no magicka for 30 seconds. Secret of Protection — You take half damage for 30 seconds. Achievements[edit] One achievement is related to this quest: Hidden Knowledge (40 points/Bronze)"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Black_Book:_The_Hidden_Twilight_(quest)","Read the Black Book The Hidden Twilight in Tel Mithryn. Make your way through Apocrypha‎. Learn the Black Book's hidden knowledge. Choose your reward.","There are eight chapters/zones here, so be prepared for a trek. You'll materialize in a room with a platform and two fonts of magicka. A scrye is past the platform, straight ahead. Activate the scrye and the door behind it will open, revealing a book on a pedestal: the next chapter. Before going in, search behind and below the pedestal to find a pod containing loot. Chapter II starts out as a corridor twisting past fonts of magicka built into the walls of books. When the path opens up, beware two seekers wandering the room ahead. Dispose of them and grab the soul gem on an altar, then head east where a ramp leads up. At the end of the ramp is another scrye. Upon activating the scrye, the bridge below you will curve upwards and peak before receding again and will repeat this cycle indefinitely. The goal is to sprint to the edge of the bridge as it reaches its peak before leaping to the next ledge before it begins its descent. The timing is delicate but if you fall you will land on a grated path that will lead you back up to where you were before. There are two such bridges before reaching the other side. When you reach solid ground there will be two paths forward. The passage to the left leads to a dead end containing a Font of Stamina near a pod. Just beside there is an altar with at two soul gems. If your Conjuration skill is above 40 a Conjure Seeker spell tome will be present as well. Head back to the top of the ramp and travel down the right hand passage to find the portal to Chapter III. Chapter III begins at the base of a book pillar. You can go either way but by taking the left route you can temporarily evade the nearby Seeker. Hugging the left wall will bring you to a Font of Stamina along the southeast edge of the book barricade just before the opening into the main chamber. Turn left and round the corner to find a pod in an alcove with some minor loot. Exit the alcove and turn west. Do not try to head for the platform yet as the stairs have to be released by activating the scrye situated above where you stand presently. Face west and turn right. Just outside the entry arch there is a ramp. Climb the ramp until you reach the roof of the entryway where you will find the scrye at the edge of the lattice beneath a floating lantern. Activate it and descend the ramp back down towards the main path. Dispatch the Seeker as you cross the abyssal waters. Take care as tentacles will lash at you as you cross. There are three soul gems on the platform along the way to the other side. When you reach the end of the crossing you will find an enclosure with a set of stairs directly to the left of a font of stamina. Dispatch the lurker and walk past the font of stamina and up the stairs through the arch facing directly south. From there you can climb a ramp that leads to the scyre which opens the gates to the enclosure. Before moving to the next area, take a right at the bottom of the stairs when you come back down the ramp. You should see two curved tendril-shaped lamps. Pass between them, take a sharp left and then turn south again. You should notice another font of stamina inside a book crevice. Walk towards it and you will find the gate to chapter IV. There is a seeker on the other side so be ready for a fight. Chapter IV consists of only one small room with nothing but the seeker and a scrye. Activating it opens a gate in chapter V that provides access to a set of five skill books, one for each school of magic. Go back to Chapter III and retrace your steps to the gate you opened before entering Chapter IV. The next gate can be opened by a scrye up the ramp to the south-southwest. A seeker is in the maze-like section ahead, so kill it and go east. There is what looks like a dead end up ahead, but as you approach the rest of the corridor telescopically expands outward. There is a pod on the north side just before the newly-visible section of corridor. At the end are Chapter V and Chapter VI. Choose your new power. Entering chapter V lands you in front of another seeker. Defeat it and activate the scrye which opens a gate in the northwest corner of the chamber. There you will find A Hypothetical Treachery, Racial Phylogeny, Breathing Water, Before the Ages of Man, and 2920 Hearth Fire v9 resting on an altar next to a pod. Return to Chapter III, turn right, and enter Chapter VI. This area is very small, but leads to both Chapter VII and Chapter VIII. Enter Chapter VII, kill the seeker, and activate yet another scrye to raise a bridge in Chapter VIII. Return to Chapter VI, turn to your left, and enter Chapter VIII. Upon arrival you will be ambushed by another seeker. Just before you reach the bridge, take a left to find another altar with a few soul gems. Loot the area and return to the crossing. Make preparations here as a lurker will burst from a pool on the left side of the platform opposite where you are standing as you cross the bridge. Depending on your current level, a second lurker may appear from the right pool as well. Crossing one last bridge lands you at The Hidden Twilight, your final destination. Other loot is scattered around the same area, including a vessel, four soul gems (two black and two grand), and three scrolls (a Scroll of Ebonyflesh, a Scroll of Grand Healing, and a Scroll of Paralyze). Upon opening the book, three green orbs will appear in front of you, one for each reward. Choose one, then activate the open book to travel back to Tel Mithryn. If at a later time you want to change your reward, reread the book and you will be transported to this location again. You will not have to trek through the previous chapters. Reward[edit] Your choice of one of three greater powers: Mora's Agony — Summons a field of writhing tentacles that poisons foes. Mora's Grasp — Freezes the target between Oblivion and Tamriel for 30 seconds, making them immune to all damage. Mora's Boon — Fully restores your health, magicka, and stamina.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Black_Book:_The_Sallow_Regent_(quest)","Read the Black Book The Sallow Regent in White Ridge Barrow. Travel through Apocrypha‎. Learn the Black Book's hidden knowledge. Choose your reward.","The darkness inside After reading The Sallow Regent you will enter a considerably darker region of Apocrypha than most others. Quickly light a torch or cast a spell of Candlelight as entering the darkness will quickly drain your health. Upon entering you will encounter a small poisoned pool with a pod next to it containing a few books, some gold, and possibly a spell tome. If you are low on potions or health after the long trek through the Barrow, it is wise to avoid this pod as the tentacle will inevitably strike you. It may be possible to access it without injury using the Slow Time shout. Visibility is poor in this section of Apocrypha. Fog combined with abstruse darkness makes for a haunting environment. A hovering light which you can follow in the absence of a torch or light spell will mark the way forward. After passing under a curved lamp you will find a circular pool with an amorphous eye protruding from the depths, next to another pod. Watch for the tentacle here as well, though this one is easier to access safely than the first. Following the hovering lamp you will make a right turn at the next curved lamp and ascend a hallway leading to an open area where you will encounter two or three seekers. The fog and absence of lighting makes it difficult to ascertain their location while they are still invisible (as normally they leave a faint, black aura where they float), so be prepared for a fight as soon as you climb the ramp. With the Eagle Eye and Steady Hand Archery skills it is possible to snipe them through the fog through careful observation.  The arena in front of you will be lit spontaneously by waves of light drifting through the black mist. After dispatching the seekers return to the lamp that marks the entry way to this area. Turn to your left and move along the wall to encounter a pod containing some minor loot. Go back to the lamp and turn right, following the right hand wall until you find a two shelves set upon stone carved pillars. You will find there the speech skill book 2920, Second Seed, v5 along with the alteration spell book Detect Undead, among numerous ruined books. You may also find a few scrolls or a soul gem. Between the pillars sits another pod. Continue following the right hand wall until you come across a semi-spherical object with a large claw like formation extending forth from its top. Around the corner to the right you will find an altar containing the spell tome  Conjure Seeker with several soul gems amid some ruined books. Turn east and make way toward the light hovering around two curved street lamps, above which flies a green and yellow banner. There is a pod to the left of the portal containing a few books and possibly an Atronach Forge Recipe. Pass through the lamps and up a ramp until you reach a winding path with no boundaries. Be careful here as you can easily fall off either side. The pathways that connect each pillar expand and contract with the motion of the overhead lights, so be aware of their presence or you will fall to your death. You will notice a Lurker shambling down the ramp one level higher, potentially coming your way. Casting a spell of Magelight towards any object in his vicinity will divert his attention. It is possible to cause the Lurker to fall off the platform by using Magelight repeatedly so that he follows the light up the ramp until he meets a pathway that is not lit. If you don't know Magelight then ranged attacks are your best bet here, as the pathways are narrow and you can easily be thrown off by the force of the Lurker's attacks. It may be possible to use Unrelenting Force to shove the Lurker off the ramps as well. Ascending the ramps you will encounter another altar with a spell tome and one or more soul crystals. Your final encounter may be with a Lurker Guardian, so be prepared for a fight when you reach the main platform just before ascending the stairs to the end of Apocrypha. After you have defeated it, you will find to the right of The Sallow Regent a scroll of Summon Storm Atronach and a Flame Thrall spell tome. To the left another you will find another altar containing several soul gems. Read the book to exit Apocrypha and return to White Ridge Barrow, thus finishing the quest. Rewards[edit] Your choice of one of three abilities: Seeker of Might — Combat skills are all 10% more effective. Seeker of Sorcery — All spells cost 10% less magicka.

Learn the Black Book's hidden knowledge. Choose your reward.","After reading the black book, you'll find yourself on a low path surrounded by water. Walk forward quickly to avoid the tentacles on either side. Up the stairs, you'll encounter a Seeker. If you take too long, or fight too far forward, you may attract the attention of another Seeker farther ahead. At the top of the stairs is a pool of poisonous water, which contains another tentacle, a Font of Stamina, and a Scrye. If your Conjuration skill is above 40, you will also find a spell tome for the Conjure Seeker spell here. Activating the Scrye will open a gate to your left, into a series of tunnels with fenced walls. Here there are two tables with soul gems, and a pod filled with loot. You will come to a second Scrye by one of these tables and a Font of Stamina. Activate it and a gate will open to the next chamber, which has a pool with a tentacle and another Seeker (if you did not have to fight it before). This small room contains a third Scrye, which opens up a larger room containing some green fog. Entering the fog will cause a leveled Lurker to emerge from a pool in the center of this room. Defeat it, then climb the ramp to find a table and two pedestals with soul gems, scrolls, and the two-handed skill book Words and Philosophy, as well as the fourth Scrye. If you haven't read the skill book already, you may want to get Scholar's Insight before doing so. Activate the Scrye to open the final door, then return down the ramp and activate the final Scrye on your left, which will extend a staircase leading to the door you just opened. Ascend the stairs to find a loot-filled vessel and the Black Book: Winds of Change. You may pick one reward, and after that, read the book again to return to Solstheim. Rewards[edit] Your choice of one of three abilities: Companion's Insight — Your attacks, shouts, and Destruction spells do no damage to your followers when in combat.

Learn the Black Book's hidden knowledge. Choose your reward.","There are five chapters: Chapter I is basically a corridor that leads to Chapter II, containing no enemies and only three soul gems in the way of loot.  These can be found at the very end of the chapter, at the final bend just before the book that leads to Chapter II. Chapter II has exits to both Chapter III and Chapter IV, enabling you to bypass Chapter III if you wish. There is a leveled lurker to battle before reaching either exit. The lurker is standing near a Font of Stamina and a Font of Magicka. There is another Font of Magicka by the exit to Chapter IV.  The exit to Chapter IV can be found by taking the corridor south and then west; whereas the exit for Chapter III is taking the corridor north. Chapter III contains a seeker, a spell tome of Conjure Seeker if your Conjuration skill is at least 65, and a container of loot. These are all in the same enclosed starting area, so that the Seeker will attack you just as you enter the Chapter; the spell tome is in the beginning area as well.  There is no direct path from Chapter III to Chapter IV, so you do have to return to Chapter II. Chapter IV contains the most loot including four stealth based skill books, two soul gems and four containers of loot as well as three seekers to battle. It starts off on an open platform with two Fonts of Stamina; walking down the corridor will take you past a well-lit Font of Magicka.  You will head south into another open area; all the Seekers are here together.  There are various landings here going in roughly the eight cardinal directions; the northeast one contains a locked treasure pod, a soul gem, and the four skill books.  East is another locked pod and another Scrye which opens the middle.  Southeast goes nowhere.  South is initially unclimbable.  Southwest contains another locked treasure pod.  By the west gate is a Scrye which opens said gate.  Inside is another Scrye which opens the east landing.  There is a pod to the northwest.  North returns you to the corridor to Chapter II.  The middle Scrye opens out the southern stairs, allowing exit to Chapter V. Chapter V contains a corridor that initially points towards the final reward, but may bend to the left or right whenever you move down the corridor. If it does, you'll be directed towards a room with a leveled lurker. Kill the lurker and a door will open behind it, allowing you to return to the central room.

Cleanse the star from within.","The Twilight of the Future[edit] Aranea Ienith All over Skyrim, innkeepers will readily tell you about the Shrine of Azura, a monument built by the Dunmer after they fled Morrowind. Additionally, an encounter with the wandering Dunmer Faldrus will point you in the same direction, so make your way to the shrine; it is located in the snowy mountains south of Winterhold. The gigantic statue faces south atop a mountain and a long staircase. The only remaining worshipper at the Shrine, the mage Aranea Ienith, will claim that your arrival was expected, as Azura herself foresaw it and transferred the knowledge to her. The prediction involves a ""fortress endangered by water, yet untouched by it"" and finding an ""elven mage able to turn the brightest star as black as night"". Aranea will admit her description to be more cryptic than useful and will direct you to the snowy town of Winterhold for clues. In Winterhold, numerous people can help, directing you to talk to a mage named Nelacar.  Dialogue   Name  ""Is there an elven mage here that studies stars?""  Follow-Up Question(Option 1)  Response  Follow-Up Question(Option 2)  Response   Dagur  ""The mages are up in the College. You can ask them, if they'll let you in.Then again, Nelacar might know. He's an old-timer from the College, but he has a room here.""   Nirya  ""Did you say an ""elf"" and ""stars""? I hope you don't know what you're asking.""  What is it? What happened?  ""There was an... unfortunate incident a few years ago. An elven mage named Nelacar was exiled from the College over it.He's still in town, getting by plying spells to the people inside the Frozen Hearth. Disgraceful.""  Would you believe I was given a vision?  ""You were given a vision? Are you serious?Whatever. The person you probably want is Nelacar. He's in the Frozen Hearth. Be careful, he was exiled from the College for a reason.""   Mirabelle Ervine  """"An elf that studies stars""? Where did you hear about that?""  ""Officially, nothing.Why don't you head into town and get a drink at the Frozen Hearth? I hear old Nelacar still has a room there. He knows a lot of stories, that one.""  ""No. I wouldn't.Why don't you head into town and get a drink at the Frozen Hearth? I hear old Nelacar still has a room there. He knows a lot of stories, that one.""   Tolfdir  ""Studies stars you say? Why, there hasn't been a mage doing anything related to stars since.... Oh....""  ""Well, it's a... minor stain on the College's reputation. One of many, unfortunately.You should head to the Frozen Hearth and speak with Nelacar. It's his story to tell, and I wouldn't want to discredit him by talking behind his back.""

""Almost the opposite. The College got rid of something... someone, that was too much trouble.There's an Altmer named Nelacar staying at the inn outside the College. You should ask him about it."" However, it's not necessary to speak with them, so it's fastest to simply go straight to the Frozen Hearth and talk to Nelacar directly. The Black Star[edit] Nelacar will provide the information that you seek, while reluctant at first, thinking you another applicant for the College of Winterhold. If you reveal yourself as an agent of Azura, you will have to pass an easy-level Speech check or he will dismiss you outright. He will not say no to a bit of coin either, and will break down if you intimidate him (see bugs section). Option  Dialogue  Reaction   A priestess of Azura sent me. (Persuade) Passed: Azura? Gods, it's all finally coming back to haunt me.Failed: You're working with the Daedra? Right. Now tell me the one about the Argonian Maid and the lusty baron. Passed: Locate the StarFailed: Nothing   Look, I'm willing to pay. (Bribe) Passed: A few coins for my soul? If only you understood the irony.Failed: I don't think you understand. I'm not answering questions. Passed: Locate the StarFailed: Nothing   I didn't agree to anything. Talk. (Intimidate) Passed: Just calm down. I'll tell you everything.Failed: Do you think muscling me is going to work? I'm a wizard. An old. Elven. Wizard. Think about it. Passed: Locate the StarFailed: Nothing   I misspoke. Forget I asked. That's for the best. Nothing Either way, he will quickly ask you what you know about soul gems and provide a quick introduction, stating that they all break after use, except for one. He will then tell you the story of one Malyn Varen, a former teacher at the College, who examined the Daedric artifact Azura's Star along with a few colleagues and students. Nobody knew that Malyn was actually ill and dying and was using the Star to save himself. But by trying to make himself immortal, he lost his sanity in the process. One day, the experiment escalated to the point where Malyn killed a student and attempted to use her soul for research and, as a result, was banished from the College. He, along with a few loyal disciples, moved to the secluded depths of Ilinalta's Deep. Nelacar will finish with a plea that you don't return the Star to Azura. His request will be left hanging, as you can do nothing but travel to Ilinalta's Deep and search for Malyn and the Star. Ilinalta's Deep[edit] A fisherman without a soul What turned Ilinalta into Ilinalta's Deep remains a mystery, as the entire fort suddenly sank into Lake Ilinalta with only the rooftops sticking out of the water. According to local legend, the place is cursed and travelers are known to go missing. Upon entering, the earthly remains of a Fisherman, his bones still in shackles, will welcome you. Examine his knapsack for a journal and some minor loot, then proceed forward and take a left at the waterfall. Not surprisingly, given the background story provided by Nelacar, the inhabitants include necromancers and their Undead allies, so be on the lookout for rare ingredients and potions. The fourth room, almost completely flooded, contains two necromancers and an underwater chest. Two water-soaked sleeping areas follow, with the second one containing the Alteration skill book Breathing Water (floating or on the ceiling, in a side room whose entrance is underwater), and the last containing the Enchanting skill book A Tragedy in Black, an alchemy lab, and an arcane enchanter, along with a locked door hiding minor loot. The next area includes a necromage, who will use frost spells, and a resurrected bandit on the other side of a pond. Dispose of the opposition, locate a nearby chest for some treasure, then pull the chain on the wall. This not only lowers the bridge behind you, it also provides access to the second zone further ahead. Stairs down the east wall into the water lead to a locked door, behind which potions and a chest are to be found. Take the western exit, and consider unlocking the door for a few potions. Proceed forward, remove the bar from the door and reenter the very first chamber of the zone, this time on a different level. You can now easily gain access to the second zone through the northern door, and a new bridge leading downstairs will make future exploration much easier.  Malyn Varen[edit] The remains of Malyn Varen Proceed carefully forward through the tunnel and you will overhear two necromancers having a conversation on how to find another soul for the insatiable Star: ""More souls are needed for the Star. The last one died before he could be harvested."" ""We can't take another villager from the surface so soon. I told you to prepare everything properly!"" ""We can just sacrifice another disciple. Apprentice Haerlon will be no great waste."" ""Yes. He'll do."" Dispose of them and look around the area for a few soul gems and the Conjuration skill book The Doors of Oblivion. A few potions can be found behind the eastern door, while the western tunnel leads to an imprisonment area guarded by a skeleton and yet another necromancer. In the final chamber, a boss-level necromancer will quickly reanimate three skeletons; after the fight, head up the stairs where you will find a dead bandit lying in her own blood, the earthly remains of Malyn Varen, along with his revealing Grimoire, a boss-leveled chest, and Azura's Star, currently broken due to Malyn's experiments. Taking the Star on the floor next to the dead bandit has no consequences, other than a choice: either bring the Star to Nelacar in Winterhold or to Aranea at the Shrine. A Soul to Keep[edit] If you return to the Shrine, you will speak to Azura. She will tell you that it is unusable until you have purged Varen's soul from the star. Likewise, Nelacar will tell you the same thing. The difference is the Star's use afterwards. If you bring it to Azura, you will be able to use it to trap any sized soul except for black souls (i.e., souls from NPCs). If you bring it to Nelacar, you will be able to trap all souls, including black, though Nelacar tells you that it can only trap black souls (see bugs section).  The Black StarNelacarWhen you return to the Frozen Hearth, Nelacar will be astounded that you managed to bring back the Star, but will soon realize the exact reason for the many disappearances in and around Ilinalta. Malyn Varen now resides inside the Star, but, to stay alive, needs more and more souls, which were provided by his disciples until now. After a bit of examination, Nelacar will see the opportunity to finish what he and Malyn started all those years ago, and will suggest that you cleanse the Star. If you accept, he will trap your soul and send you into the Star to confront Malyn.    Azura's StarAraneaHead back to the Shrine of Azura, and an eager Aranea will immediately take the broken Star from you, then invite you to communicate with Azura. Place your hands upon the altar, and Azura will speak from the planes of Oblivion. She will say how grateful she is to see the Star returned, but will also provide the bad news: due to Malyn's occupation of the Star, the artifact will be useless to you until you venture inside and banish Malyn's soul by defeating him. Once you are ready, Azura will promise to watch over you as you are transported inside the Star's realm. Inside the Star[edit] Malyn Varen inside the Star Once you have made your choice, you will be transported inside the star to battle Malyn Varen. The interior of Azura's Star is a light-blue, surreal world with spikes and chiming sounds. Malyn will be waiting for you just inside, eager to feast on yet another soul; he will, however, quickly realize that something is wrong and rush further into the Star, throwing a few leveled Dremora at you. The interior offers very little to hide behind, making stealth a difficult option for combat. It is not possible to fall over the ledges, so proceed forward and remember to collect the valuable Daedra Hearts from fallen enemies. Once you have defeated Malyn, depending on your earlier choice, the Star will turn either black or white and you will be returned to your mortal body in Skyrim. If you went with Aranea, you will be given the restored Azura's Star, capable of capturing White Souls. Additionally, Azura will set Aranea free and she may become a follower. If you went with Nelacar, you will receive The Black Star."

This will lead you to Riverwood and the Sleeping Giant Inn. Speak with the innkeeper, Delphine, about renting the attic room. She will tell you that there is no such room, but you can take the room on the left. Delphine will follow you to the sparse room she indicated, where she will address you as Dragonborn and give you the Horn. She cryptically tells you that you and she need to talk and asks you to follow her. The Problem with Dragons[edit] Delphine will lead you to a room across the inn. She will ask you to close the door to the room before both you and she can proceed any further. Do it, and she will open a secret passage in the back of a wardrobe that leads down to a subterranean room. Here Delphine will reveal that she took the Horn to attract the attention of the Dragonborn. The note was a safeguard to protect against trickery by the Thalmor. She also tells you that the dragons are not just coming back, but are actually coming back to life, resurrected from their burial mounds. Only the Dragonborn can permanently kill dragons by absorbing their souls. But she is not quite ready to accept you as Dragonborn, despite the Greybeards' interest in you. Luckily, she has a task to prove your authenticity. According to the Dragonstone map taken from Bleak Falls Barrow, the next dragon will rise from a burial mound in Kynesgrove. She wants you to accompany her to the burial site and kill the dragon; only then will she accept you as Dragonborn. If you tell her you're ready to leave, she will put on her gear and leave the inn. You are free to follow Delphine to Kynesgrove, and she will briefly talk to you at waypoints about her concerns. Or you can go at your own pace and possibly beat her there. Kynesgrove[edit] As soon as you get to Kynesgrove, Iddra, the innkeeper, will run up to you and tell you that a dragon was sighted flying over the burial mound and that you should get out of town. If you traveled with Delphine, she will run up ahead of you to the burial mound, fearing it may be too late. If you arrived ahead of her, she will appear shortly thereafter on the mound behind you. Speaking with Dragons[edit] Upon arriving at the site, you and Delphine will witness the dragon, Alduin, using his Thu'um to resurrect a dead dragon. Alduin cannot be killed or injured at this time. When the dragon, Sahloknir, is whole once more, he has a conversation in the dragon language with Alduin. Alduin: Sahloknir, ziil gro dovah ulse!  Sahloknir! Your soul is bound to me for eternity! Alduin: Slen tiid vo! (Flesh Time Opposite Of) Sahloknir: Alduin, thuri! Boaan tiid vokriiha suleyksejun kruziik? Alduin, my king (overlord)! Has the time arrived (flown) to restore (unkill) your ancient dominion (power-of-king)? Alduin: Geh, Sahloknir, kaali mir. Yes, Sahloknir, my loyal champion. Start with these mortals. Here, Alduin attempts to speak to you, addressing you as Dovahkiin. Alduin: Ful, losei Dovahkiin? Zu'u koraav nid nol dov do hi. So, you're the Dragonborn? I see nothing of the dragon about you. (So, you are Dragonborn? I recognize no from dragon of you.) Alduin: You do not even know our tongue, do you? Such arrogance, to dare take for yourself the name of Dovah. Alduin: Sahloknir, krii daar joorre. Sahloknir, kill these mortals. After ordering Sahloknir to kill you, Alduin flies away. Delphine will help you kill Sahloknir, and upon his death, when you absorb his soul, Delphine will be quick to acknowledge you as Dragonborn. Paranoia[edit] Speak to her, and she will reveal that she is one of the last members of the Blades. She will also tell you about her suspicions that the Thalmor are responsible for the return of the dragons. Since the Thalmor are part of the Aldmeri Dominion and nearly destroyed the Empire during the Great War only 30 years ago, they have a motive for rescuing Ulfric in Helgen, simply in order to keep the war raging. The Thalmor stand to benefit most from damage to the Empire by the dragons. Finally, she will reveal her plan to infiltrate the Thalmor Embassy to search for evidence of their connection with the dragons. She has no idea how to get past embassy security, and asks you to meet her back in Riverwood. This quest concludes, and the Diplomatic Immunity quest starts."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bleak_Falls_Barrow_(quest)","Talk to Farengar Secret-Fire. Start the quest The Golden Claw. Retrieve the Dragonstone from Bleak Falls Barrow. Return to Farengar.","Meet the Court Wizard[edit] During the final stages of the quest Before the Storm, you will be tasked with a trip from Riverwood to Whiterun to tell Jarl Balgruuf about what happened in Helgen. Make your way to the Dragonsreach palace, where you will be stopped by the housecarl Irileth, who will demand a good reason to interrupt the jarl. You can either tell her about the dragon or report that Riverwood calls for the jarl's aid, both of which will grant you an immediate audience. Deliver the news to Balgruuf, who will order troops to be sent to Riverwood at once and then present you with a reward. He will then remember a job suitable for an adventurer such as yourself and lead you to the court wizard Farengar Secret-Fire, who has been researching dragons. Farengar wants you to fetch the unique Dragonstone from Bleak Falls Barrow, an ancient Nordic tomb near Riverwood. When you question him on what he knows about the quest, he will keep his information sources secret. Note: If you already cleared Bleak Falls Barrow and retrieved the Dragonstone during the quest The Golden Claw, Farengar will prompt you to hand it over immediately and complete the quest. See the notes section for what you may have missed. Bleak Falls Barrow[edit] As the concurrent quest The Golden Claw runs simultaneously with this quest, travel to Riverwood and enter the Riverwood Trader. Talk to the proprietor, who will tell you that a precious item was stolen from the main trading room, which will trigger the quest. Locate the ancient barrow and fight the bandits protecting the entrance. Bleak Falls Temple starts with a giant chamber with dead skeevers scattered about and the voices of two bandit inhabitants audible from the back of the room, discussing something of great importance. If you have not yet triggered The Golden Claw, it will begin now, due to the subject of the conversation: Bandits in Bleak Falls Temple Bandit #1: ""So we're just supposed to sit here while Arvel runs off with that golden claw?"" Bandit #2: ""That dark elf wants to go on ahead, let him. Better than us risking our necks."" Bandit #1: ""What if Arvel doesn't come back? I want my share from that claw!"" Bandit #2: ""Just shut it and keep an eye out for trouble."" Either use ranged attacks on them from afar, battle them up-close and personally, or sneak around them and search the area for loot, including the contents of a locked chest. Proceed through the empty tunnels until you arrive in a puzzle room where another bandit is attempting to pull a handle. You can attack him yourself, or allow him to be killed by darts that he accidentally triggers. To avoid the same fate, look around the room and towards the upper level to see the correct combination for the movable pillars. Two symbols are up on the ledge above, while the middle one has fallen to the ground level next to the lever. They should be read from left to right, using the one on the ground as the middle symbol, in order to find the combination: Snake—Snake—Whale. Activate the movable pillars to position them. You can now pull the handle without being killed. The iron gate will swing open, allowing access to a room with a soul gem, a potion, a chest, and a copy of the Pickpocket skill book Thief. Locate the spiral staircase, head underground, and beware of a few skeevers lurking on the steps. Arvel the Swift[edit] ""Get it away from me. Get it away!"" At the foot of the stairs, everything is covered in cobwebs, hinting at the next major room's inhabitant. As you move around, you will notice a voice calling out from somewhere: ""Is... is someone coming? Is that you Harknir? Bjorn? Soling? I know I ran ahead with the claw, but I need help!"" Follow the sound and you will end up in a large chamber guarded by a wounded frostbite spider. After the battle, examine the western tunnel where Arvel the Swift is hanging in the webs, completely unable to move and obviously being kept for a later meal. Talk to him and he will reveal that he knows how to use the golden claw and makes great promises to you if you free him from the web: ""You did it. You killed it. Now cut me down before anything else shows up."" Where's the golden claw? ""Yes, the claw. I know how it works. The claw, the markings, the door in the Hall of Stories. I know how they all fit together! Help me down, and I'll show you. You won't believe the power the Nords have hidden there."" Attack the webs surrounding Arvel and he will be free; unfortunately, he will also betray you and take off running deeper into Bleak Falls Barrow. You can either give chase or let him run, as he is too weak to survive the upcoming draugr-infested catacombs. Run past two rooms and gather a small amount of loot along the way, including a soul gem. When the dead start to rise, dispose of them and beware the pressure plate and the corresponding spike wall. Be on the lookout for Arvel the Swift, who will likely fall prey to either the spiked wall or the following leveled draugr enemy. When you find his body, loot the golden claw and, for a bit of help on how to solve upcoming puzzles in the barrow, his journal. When you claim the claw, you will receive a quest update for the corresponding quest, and will be told to discover the 'secret of Bleak Falls Barrow'. Proceed forward and kill the three draugr in the next room.  To the right of the swinging blades is a short staircase that ends in rubble.  There is a chest containing minor loot at the top of the stairs. Dodge the swinging blades in the eastern tunnel. In the catacombs ahead, use the oil slick on the floor to your advantage or kill the attacking draugr normally. Follow the path until you arrive in a large chamber with a waterfall and one more draugr enemy, as well as a chest with minor loot. Activate the chain, head downstream along the underground creek, and beware the long fall where the creek turns into a waterfall through a hole in the eastern wall. If you search this area, you will find a pick and can learn how to mine ore. There is minor loot in the area and plants/mushrooms to gather. By the waterfall and entrance to the narrow tunnel, there is a chest to loot. Take the narrow tunnel leading south. You will emerge on a bridge halfway down the waterfall for a fight against another draugr (note that if you are a higher level you may find a frost troll instead of a draugr). Head all the way down to the bottom for some minor loot in a locked chest, then return to the bridge and head north. The final room is protected by a leveled draugr. Upon its defeat, loot yet another locked chest in the room and then head through the door to Bleak Falls Sanctum. The Secret of Bleak Falls Barrow[edit] A mysterious wall In the beginning, the Sanctum is rather quiet with a set of swinging blades as the only obstacle. The next room, however, sees three draugr enemies and another helpful oil slick, if needed. Climb the wooden structure and proceed over the bridge to open the iron door. You will now face a puzzle door with three rotating rings. Following Arvel's advice from his journal, take a closer look at the golden claw in your inventory for the right combination. Rotate the rings to achieve the combination of Bear—Moth—Owl (bear on top, owl on bottom), then place the claw in the keyhole and watch as the door lowers. It opens to a huge chamber, complete with waterfalls, bats, and a Word Wall. Before entering the area with the wall, investigate the rocks to the right for a hidden, locked chest. Take a look opposite the word wall for a suspicious-looking sarcophagus and a chest with a good number of valuable items. Approach the word wall to learn the secret of the barrow, a word for the Unrelenting Force shout. After learning the word, the sarcophagus will burst open and a boss-level draugr overlord will step out and attack. Fight him and then examine his corpse for the Dragonstone, the item requested by Farengar Secret-Fire. Before leaving, look to the south; behind the smaller waterfall is another chest. Finally, climb up the stairs and activate the handle, which will elevate the stone wall and bring you to an alternative exit from Bleak Falls Barrow. A Stranger[edit] In his quarters inside Dragonsreach, provided you started this quest before clearing out Bleak Falls Barrow (see notes), Farengar Secret-Fire will be accompanied by Delphine, the innkeeper from the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood. She is obviously his 'reliable source', as the conversation reveals quite an extensive knowledge about the dragon situation. Delphine and Farengar Secret-Fire Farengar: ""You see? The terminology is clearly First Era or even earlier. I'm convinced this is a copy of a much older text.  Perhaps dating to just after the Dragon War. If so, I could use this to cross-reference the names with other later texts."" Delphine: ""Good. I'm glad you're making progress. My employers are anxious to have some tangible answers."" Farengar: ""Oh, have no fear. The Jarl himself has finally taken an interest, so I'm now able to devote most of my time to this research."" Delphine: ""Time is running, Farengar, don't forget. This isn't some theoretical question. Dragons have come back."" Farengar:  ""Yes, yes. Don't worry. Although the chance to see a living dragon up close would be tremendously valuable... Now, let me show you something else I found... very intriguing... I think your employers may be interested as well..."" Delphine: ""You have a visitor."" Farengar: ""Hmm? Ah, yes, the Jarl's protege! Back from Bleak Falls Barrow? You didn't die, it seems."" At this point, Farengar will notice your presence and lift the Dragonstone from your inventory with his thanks. While not as grateful as Farengar, Delphine is quite impressed with your efforts. After this acknowledgment, Delphine will return to studying the copy of Holdings of Jarl Gjalund while Farengar will direct you to Jarl Balgruuf for your reward. After this, the quest Dragon Rising will initiate and you will have to wait a few moments for your reward... Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: Bleak Falls Barrow (10 points/Bronze)"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Blessings_of_Nature","Agree to help Danica Pure-Spring restore the Gildergreen. Head to Orphan Rock and claim Nettlebane. Return to Danica, who sends you to the Eldergleam Sanctuary. (Optional) Escort Maurice Jondrelle to Eldergleam. Use Nettlebane to cut through the roots, then make a choice: Activate Eldergleam to retrieve the sap. Let Maurice pray to the tree and obtain a sapling. Return to Danica to complete the quest.","The Gildergreen[edit] ""It's a shame, isn't it?"" The only temple dedicated to Kynareth, goddess of air, wind, and sky, is located in Whiterun and is being maintained by priestess Danica Pure-Spring. Just outside the temple grows the Gildergreen, a tree planted in the earliest days of Whiterun and considered holy by worshippers of Kynareth. However, the tree was recently struck by lightning and has faded away, much to the dismay of traveling pilgrims and the citizens of Whiterun. Danica Pure-Spring, while willing to solve the problem with the sacred tree, has her hands full due to the civil war, so the tree is still dead. If you ask innkeeper Hulda or local bard Mikael for the latest gossip, they will both tell you about the state of the tree and point you towards Danica Pure-Spring. Danica sits under the tree every morning from 7am, trying to get someone to help her out; otherwise she will be in the temple tending to the sick and injured. When you talk to her, she will immediately complain about the situation, and explain what needs to be done to make it bloom again. Nettlebane[edit] ""You'll have to deal with the Hagravens."" The Gildergreen was grown from a cutting of the legendary Eldergleam, an ancient tree said to be thousands of years old, from before the Atmorans set foot in Skyrim. Danica claims that sap from the parent tree can be used to restore the Gildergreen to its former glory, but there is a catch. The Eldergleam can't be cut with a normal weapon, so you will have to deal with hagravens and claim the dagger they made to kill spriggans, named Nettlebane. Danica then sends you off to Orphan Rock, a hagraven nest northeast of Helgen. As you approach Orphan Rock, you will find the surrounding area protected by four residing witches, two of them on the ground below the rock and two more witches near a camp further up the slope. They will attack you on sight and use lower-level destruction spells to keep you away from Orphan Rock and its unique treasure. The rock itself is accessed via a fallen-down tree stump and is protected by a single hagraven who will use fire spells on you. She can be difficult to deal with at lower levels, so it's advisable to try to kill the witches first before alerting her to your presence. Once you've disposed of the hagraven claim Nettlebane from the corpse, then loot Orphan Rock of valuables. An Angry Pilgrim[edit] Back in the Temple of Kynareth, Danica has received a visit from a traveling pilgrim, namely Maurice Jondrelle who is understandably upset about the current state of the Gildergreen and now spends his time bothering the busy priestess: ""What is it... what has happened to the Gildergreen?"" Maurice: ""What is it... what has happened to the Gildergreen? I have traveled long here to worship beneath its branches."" Danica: ""It was taken by a lightning strike. Wish I had time to deal with it, but it's hard enough with all these wounded from the war."" Maurice: ""Please, don't just let it stay like this. It's disgraceful."" Danica: ""I really don't have time to deal with you right now. Please just let me get back to my work."" Maurice: ""But this is supposed to be your work."" When you show Danica the dagger you acquired from the hagraven, she will be quite surprised but will refuse to touch it, leading to her asking for another favor. You are to travel to the Eldergleam Sanctuary and retrieve some of its sap. From his spot in the corner, Maurice Jondrelle will overhear the conversation and will quickly seek you out and ask if he can accompany you on the journey. He reasons that he always wanted to visit the tree of legend, so let him tag along for the ride. You can also refuse to let him tag along, but then you will miss out on some important opportunities later on. Maurice is not your average follower and can't be given orders. Additionally, he is overly aggressive for an unarmed pilgrim and will attack any enemy you encounter, even dragons. Save your game when leaving the temple (or see notes), then travel towards the Eldergleam Sanctuary, located near the sulphurous pools and hot springs of Eastmarch, and slightly north from Darkwater Crossing. Do your best to keep Maurice out of trouble, then enter the sanctuary. Eldergleam Sanctuary[edit] The Eldergleam Sanctuary is a large, naturally-lit cave inhabited by peaceful followers of Kynareth and contains the legendary tree in all its glory, its roots twisting and turning across the chamber, effectively blocking the path to the tree itself. Maurice will be understandably impressed with the place but will be quite shocked when you pull out Nettlebane. Hack away at the four roots and watch them bend away from the path. When you reach the top, an important choice is to be made, as Maurice will walk up to you and accuse you of disrespecting a true miracle of Kynareth. You can either choose to hear him out, which will result in a peaceful solution – or you can choose to ignore him and use Nettlebane to extract the sap, and awaken the wrath of Kynareth. Maurice praying to the Eldergleam The Gildergreen SaplingA prayer to KynarethIf you choose to listen to Maurice, he will reveal that he can solve Danica's problem without resorting to violence against the sacred tree. Agree to let him help and he will walk up to the tree, get down on his knees and pray silently to Kynareth. Moments afterward, a sapling will emerge from the ground and a happy Maurice will convince you that this is the correct solution, even if Danica will be unhappy: Danica will want to see that the true blessings of nature lie in renewal, not a slavish maintenance. Pick up the sapling and watch Maurice start a new life in the Sanctuary. Return to Danica in Whiterun, and tell her that you received a sapling instead of the sap. She will be skeptical about replacing the huge Gildergreen with a small sapling, but will eventually recognize it as the best solution. She will then finish the quest and will offer master training in Restoration. The next time you visit Whiterun, the Gildergreen will be growing again (see bugs).    Spriggans attack The restored GildergreenWrath of KynarethIf you choose to ignore Maurice (assuming he came with you), he will stand back as you cut the tree to extract the sap. As soon as you have acquired it, he will turn hostile and attack. Additionally, several spriggans will show up in the chamber, including a very powerful boss-leveled spriggan. They will usually kill the peaceful inhabitants and will obviously go directly after you. Dispose of Maurice (if he's there) and the spriggans. After the battle, receive the limited treasure from the now empty sanctuary and leave the same way you came. Back in Whiterun, Danica will be quite happy when you hand her the sap and will reward you with her services as a master level trainer in Restoration. This will end the quest and return the Gildergreen to its original, glorious state the next time you visit Whiterun."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Blindsighted","Travel to Irkngthand. Speak to Karliah. Locate Mercer Frey. Slay Mercer Frey. Retrieve the Skeleton Key. Escape from Irkngthand. Speak with Karliah.","After becoming a Nightingale, speak to Brynjolf. You learn that he and Karliah decided that you should be the one to replace Mercer once you deal with him. After you accept, he tells you to meet them at Irkngthand to stop Mercer Frey from stealing the Eyes of the Falmer and escaping with the Skeleton Key of Nocturnal. There are some bandits camped outside Irkngthand, but they're okay to kill or sneak past. The entrance is at the very top of the ruins. If you have a follower, they won't be able to accompany you. It's a winding path to get to the top; you may wish to come during the day so as to see it better. This dungeon is generally wide and allows enough space to sneak past most enemies. The Throw Voice shout could well come in handy to distract the numerous Falmer you'll encounter within so you can sneak past them. Irkngthand Arcanex[edit] Once inside, it is recommended you sneak everywhere because there are irises on the walls which will drop out Dwarven sphere guardians (masters if you are at a high level) that you'll have to fight. Right into the first room, you'll notice an expert-locked chest next to the dead bandits. There is another chest with an adept-level lock at your left, near the crumbled columns. There is also a master-level chest next to the wall by the crumbled columns on your right. Two bear traps are set into the stone of the platform about halfway up the stairs so that the traps are completely hidden until sprung. Defeat the Dwarven sphere inside the room with a shallow pool and proceed through the open gate. The next room has three more Dwarven spheres. Before going down the stairs, turn right and follow the path in the upper floor to find a chest. There's another chest close to the wall, on the lower floor. Continue to the next room and you'll come across several spinning flamethrower traps. Just follow in the same direction they're spinning, and you can make it through without being hurt. You can also use your Become Ethereal shout to get across easily. A couple of Dwarven spiders will attack you on the way. Enter the corridor and you'll find an apprentice-locked chest straight ahead. At the end of the corridor, there is a Dwarven spider and another chest. There is also an apprentice-locked chest on the wall to your right just before the lift to Irkngthand Grand Cavern; it is next to a stone table with a built-in alchemy lab. There are a couple of potions, two Falmer ears and some scrap metal on the same table. When you are done, enter the lift area and activate the lever to descend to Irkngthand Grand Cavern. Irkngthand Grand Cavern[edit] Karliah and Brynjolf will follow you now. Karliah believes Mercer knows that you're following and plans to ambush you down here. There is a trap on the left side of the door. After deactivating the trap wire, go through the door and continue down the hall. There is a chest behind an expert-locked gate, at your left. T In the same room there are a couple of potions, some gems, scrap metal and various ingots. There are bear traps throughout this part of Irkngthand, especially in the corridors that connect the chambers, so watch where you step. In the large room, you will see a scene of Mercer sneak attacking a Falmer, but you're unable to get to him. To open the door in the next room, you have to activate the levers on either side of the room overlooking the camp - these levers activate gears to either side of the gate, so once you have pulled the first lever, you must reach and pull the second lever before the gears activated by the first lever stop turning. The Whirlwind Sprint shout can help here. The two levers can be pulled in either order to proceed. Be careful while crossing the chamber as there are spinning blade traps set in the floor that activate when you or your allies get close. There are two chests on the path to the east lever: one is next to a Falmer tent and the other one is next to the lever itself. The next chamber is in ruins and is full of Falmer. Take the ramp along the south side of the chamber to find a chest behind a tent. At the west end of the chamber, near the collapsed tower, a set of stairs leading down is blocked by rubble. A chest with an adept-level lock can be found among the rubble. Take the ramp next to the rubble-filled steps; it goes north and then curves back toward the south wall to a door. Enter and you will reach a room with a dead Falmer inside. Behind an open gate you'll find some empty chests, scrolls of detect life (which will come in handy when fighting Mercer) and a mirrored message from Mercer. The message reads ""One step ahead - Mercer""  There is a bear trap in the first part of the corridor leading out of the room. In the next room, shoot the Dwarven centurion with an arrow while still standing on the steps - the Falmer will then fight and destroy him (it can also be activated via a button located on the side of the steps, if you drop down on the southwest side). Take the stairs on the east side of the chamber next to the skeever pen, and work your way up and around to the south end of the chamber. There are three bear traps in the walled corridor. There is a Frostbite Spider nest with a few living spiders and a single egg sac. Moving ahead, you'll find a door leading to Irkngthand Slave Pens, with a Falmer chest to its right, and a Dwemer chest to its left. Irkngthand Slave Pens[edit] The pens are used as a hive by the Falmer. There are 100 Chaurus egg sacs in the slave pens, the fourth highest concentration in Skyrim. Defeat the Dwarven spider and head up the stairs to the west to find a couple of ingots behind an apprentice-locked gate. As you come back out of the gate, turn right to harvest some glowing mushrooms along the south wall. In the southeast corner of the room, a chest is hidden behind some rubble. Down the stairs, you'll find a torture chamber with two Falmer and a dead thief inside. You can kill both Falmer by sneaking through the grid and activating the trap lever. The corridor heading north and east has three pressure plate traps. Karliah will tell you that you have a choice between sneaking or fighting the Falmer in the large chamber beyond. There is a chest located inside the third Falmer tent on the right. There is also a chest in the tent across from the third on the right. The next room has a simple pipe maze. Kill the Falmer and head up the ramp along the west wall to find another chest with an apprentice-level lock. Further down the room you'll face more Falmer and chaurus through the path that leads to Irkngthand Sanctuary. On the east wall, a nook covered with spiderwebs has an egg sac with a spider egg. Go down the ramp on the west wall, and there is an expert-locked chest in the easternmost tent. If you wish to bypass the enemies here, you may also sneak across the overhead pipes. Just before entering the corridor that leads to the Sanctuary, there's a master-locked chest next to the Falmer door. Irkngthand Sanctuary[edit] In the sanctuary, you'll see a short scene of Mercer prying out the eyes of the Falmer statue. Mercer will then collapse the ledge you're standing on, and after a short conversation, you will have to fight him. During the fight, he will use his Agent of Subterfuge power on Brynjolf, causing him to attack Karliah. This will keep Brynjolf and Karliah out of the fight. Mercer will turn invisible occasionally during the fight (position yourself on the stairs and let Mercer come to you; for whatever reason, he doesn't sneak up behind you). Use the Detect Life scrolls (or the Detect Life spell if you have it) to see him; if you have the Aura Whisper shout, this can also be used to reveal his location. If you have the Slow Time shout, use this when he appears in front of you and he can be taken easily if you are leveled high enough. Once Mercer dies, a pipe at the top of the room will burst, flooding the room. Take the Skeleton Key and the Eyes from Mercer's body, and wait for the water to rise. Once it gets high enough, a hole will appear in the roof above the statue's head. Run out through the short passage to escape. This takes you to Bronze Water Cave; if you had a follower, this is where they will be waiting for you. You can give the left eye to Delvin for gold as part of The Litany of Larceny; the right eye can be kept or sold to a merchant. Talk to Karliah to complete the quest, and she will give you her Nightingale bow."

A general fear is noticeable, but nobody will really talk about the killings, and it remains nothing but a rumor. When the right conditions have been met (see this section on how to trigger), the body of the Candlehearth Hall barmaid, Susanna the Wicked, will appear, surrounded by witnesses, in the graveyard. If you approach the scene, a guard will stop you and explain a bit about the murders. The guard also explains about the local guards being too busy with the war to do any real investigation, and they would gladly accept some help from you. For starters, he tasks you with questioning the three townsfolk gathered around the body. Investigator of Windhelm[edit] On a rare venture outside the Hall of the Dead, Helgird will be little help at the moment, but will point out that Susanna's coin purse is still intact. Calixto Corrium claims he 'saw a fellow running away, but didn't get a good look at him', while local beggar Silda the Unseen didn't make it to the scene before Susanna was dead and the killer gone. The guard will not be particularly surprised with the lack of hard evidence or witnesses, and will point you towards Castle Steward Jorleif for assistance and helpful advice. ""Large diagonal cut from left shoulder..."" In the Palace of the Kings, Jorleif will be shocked to hear about the third killing, and will gladly accept your help. He will promise you assistance from himself and all the town guards during the investigation. A map marker will now always point towards him, but he will rarely have anything helpful to add. Now it's time to investigate the crime scene without interference from the guard. Susanna's body will have been removed from the crime scene, and only the spatters of blood remain. The guard has noticed the blood as well, and hints that this evidence possibly holds a clue; however, for now you are urged to talk to Helgird in the Hall of the Dead. Due to her profession and life-long experience with dead bodies, she may be able to come up with some answers. Enter the Hall of the Dead and find Helgird busy examining Susanna's dead body, obviously puzzled by the large diagonal cuts she finds. When asked, she will reveal the shape of the cuts to be somewhat unusual, like they were made with a curved blade designed for embalming, the exact tools she uses. You can choose to indicate her involvement in the killings or simply to leave the conversation, but the results are the same. Helgird will refuse to speak to you further and will ask to be left in peace so she can prepare the body for the funeral. Because both Jorleif and the guard are unable to do anything at the moment, your only hope for finding a clue is in the graveyard. The remaining evidence seems to be a trail of blood leading from the graveyard. Follow the bloody trail around the corner and up the stairs, where it ends at the entrance to Hjerim, a huge manor opposite the House of Clan Cruel-Sea. (If you chose to follow the bloody trail before speaking to Helgird, the map marker pointing toward her will now be gone.) Hjerim[edit] The front door is locked, so either pick the lock or ask Jorleif and/or any guard in town about access to Hjerim. They will briefly tell you about how the house used to belong to the now deceased Friga Shatter-Shield, and it has been abandoned ever since her untimely death. They will also point you towards her mother, Tova Shatter-Shield. Wait for Tova to leave her house. She will be browsing the market between 11am and 3pm, while she spends her afternoons at Candlehearth Hall. When you approach the grieving mother, it becomes apparent that Friga was one of the victims of the killer. Naturally, Tova will be more than willing to hand you the key so you can go take a look inside. If you cannot find her, she may be in her home dead after committing suicide (if you have previously committed a certain murder for the Dark Brotherhood) and you can simply take the key off her body. The secret chamber When entering Hjerim, a quest update will immediately tell you to look for clues, so take a look around. The blood trail leads to a chest in the southeastern corner, so investigate it and pry it open. Within, you will find eleven pamphlets called Beware the Butcher! along with the Butcher Journal #1. Even though your quest journal now encourages you to follow up on these clues, keep looking around the house. Ignore the mead scattered on the floor and proceed to the two wardrobes in the western alcove. The wardrobe to the right is nailed to the wall, so open it and remove the false back panel. This will reveal the killer's hideout, a room filled with bones, bloody remains and the suspected embalming instruments. Investigate the altar and pick up the Butcher Journal #2 for more evidence. Leave the room, and look at the small shelf between the wardrobes. It contains even more pamphlets, but also a strange amulet. This is the last item of evidence, so make sure to pick it up. Read the pamphlet to learn about a Windhelm citizen named Viola Giordano. Before leaving, make sure you have a pamphlet and the strange amulet in your inventory. If you want to avoid investigating Hjerim with Viola later on, pick up one of the journals as well. Follow up on the Clues[edit] Pay a quick visit to the helpful Jorleif (or a guard) for advice on how to proceed. When you show him the amulet, he will be quite puzzled but will point you to Calixto at the House of Curiosities for an opinion. When asked about the term 'the Butcher' he will spitefully refer you to Viola Giordano, the author of the pamphlets and the one to seek out for background information on the killings. At this point, map markers will point to both Viola and Calixto, but it is recommended to visit Calixto first. Calixto Corrium[edit] Calixto had opened up his small museum with his now-deceased sister, showcasing the various items they found during the adventures they shared back in the day. These days, Calixto spends most of his time sitting in a chair doing absolutely nothing but mourning the loss of his sister and rambling about how happy she'd have been seeing all the curious items under one roof. Not surprisingly, Calixto will, for a small fee, offer a guided tour around the small House of Curiosities and explain the background for a few of the items. It is a good idea to accept this tour, just for the investigation. When you present him with the strange amulet, he will tell you that it's the Wheelstone, traditionally carried by court mages. He will then offer to take it off your hands for 500 gold. Due to a bug with the amulet, it is recommended to accept this offer. Viola Giordano[edit] Viola is an Imperial who tends to wander the streets of Windhelm during the day and hang out at Candlehearth Hall in the evening. Track her down (with a ""Beware the Butcher!"" flyer from Hjerim in your inventory) and question her. She is understandably upset about the presence of a serial killer and the apathy of the town guards. If you failed to pick up the journal in the hidden chamber back in Hjerim, Viola will immediately take interest in the old house and set off at a running pace to help with the investigation. If you already have the journal, Viola will point to Wuunferth, the court mage in the Palace of the Kings, as the most likely person to be experimenting with Necromancy. If you chose to speak to Viola before Calixto, the map marker pointing toward him will now be gone. Still, go sell him the strange amulet before going anywhere near the Palace of the Kings. This will net you 500 gold and one less bug to worry about. At this point, your next decision will affect how the quest proceeds, and whether the killer is able to strike again. Even if the map marker now points you towards the Palace and your journal tells you to confront Jorleif with the evidence against the court mage, talking to Jorleif can be fatal for the townsfolk of Windhelm. Another option is available, although it's unsaid. You can go directly to the accused Wuunferth and confront him yourself, without ever talking to Jorleif.  See this section if you choose to confront Wuunferth. See this section if you choose to speak to Jorleif. Your reward will remain the same regardless of your choice. Follow Your Instincts[edit] Wuunferth[edit] Wuunferth the Unliving lives a secluded life in the Palace of the Kings, but you are free to go visit him at any time. During the day, he will be in his quarters (first door on the left on entering, upstairs, at the far end). He spends his nights wandering around downstairs. Confront him with the rumors about him performing necromancy. He will be quite insulted and will ramble on about him being a member of the College of Winterhold. When you mention the journals and describe the amulet he will immediately identify it as the legendary Necromancer Amulet, while he will only feel sorry for Calixto's wild theories about it being the Wheelstone. He reveals that he has also been investigating the killings of Windhelm for quite some time. He has noted a pattern with the location and timing of the killings, so he ends up asking you to keep watch in the Stone Quarters at night, as he predicts the killer will strike again. Now leave Wuunferth alone, ignore the map marker still pointing towards Jorleif, and head to the Stone Quarters and wait until nighttime. Proceed with the walkthrough in this section. Jorleif[edit] ""Has the whole city lost their brains?"" When you tell Jorleif that Wuunferth is the main suspect and tell him about the necromancer lair in Hjerim, he will be shocked at first; he will, however, find the evidence convincing enough to take action. After thanking you for making the streets of Windhelm safe again, he will set off towards the guard patrolling the palace entrance and order him to come along for an arrest. At this point, the quest will end and you will be left behind in the main hall, without any reward whatsoever. If you follow Jorleif and the guard into Wuunferth's chambers and eavesdrop during the arrest, a frustrated Wuunferth will claim that he was investigating the murders as well, and will shout that this isn't over when the guard drags him to the barracks. At this point, it will be impossible to discuss the subject with any of the characters. ""Looks like you aren't such a sharp investigator after all."" After three full calendar days spent outside Windhelm, you will see a familiar scene upon your return. A guard will be standing next to yet another slain victim (she is on the right of Candlehearth Hall when looking from the Palace of the Kings): an Altmer named Arivanya from Windhelm Stables. The guard will be devastated and quick to inform you of your failure. A new quest with the same name will pop up in your journal, and the guard will suggest you remedy your mistake by talking to the imprisoned Wuunferth. Head to the barracks underneath the Palace and speak to the wizard. When you tell him that the Butcher has claimed yet another victim, he will point out that he is behind bars and make a jab at your abilities as an investigator. When you tell him about the journal and the amulet, he will deny any knowledge of a journal and will ask for the shape of the amulet. He will then identify it as the rare and legendary Necromancer Amulet. While he will reject Calixto's Wheelstone theory on the spot, he will reveal that he has noted a pattern in the location and timing of the killings, and will end up asking you to keep watch in the Stone Quarters at night, as he predicts the killer will strike again. Catch the Killer![edit] The killer strikes again. When you head outside, the Stone Quarter will be incredibly quiet. The entire market is usually devoid of people at night, with the exception of a guard that may be present. You can spot the murderer following his final potential victim through the graveyard and the alley, up to the steps into the market from the west. As they enter the market, you will witness elderly museum owner Calixto Corrium sneak up behind a female citizen (normally Arivanya, but another woman will be randomly chosen if she is already dead), with his knife drawn for the next kill. You can attack Calixto or use a spell on him to save his would-be victim. If you fail to dispose of him before he slits her throat, or if you attack Calixto and save her, he will panic and take off at a running pace towards his necromancer chamber in Hjerim. Follow him and be ready for a fight, although he shouldn't pose much of a problem. Once dead, loot him for the now-restored Necromancer Amulet (if you sold it to him) and a few other valuable items. Make sure to pick up his key, as it will help you reveal the truth behind the murders. If you managed to slay him outside, guards will arrive and point you towards Jorleif for one final conversation. If you slay him outside with a ranged attack, the guards will not approach even after you loot the body, instead continuing to patrol the area. When you speak to Jorleif, he will thank you and say that the city guard will be more cordial to you in the future. While optional, it is worth your time to pay a visit to Calixto's now abandoned museum of curiosities to find out the motive behind his murders. In the upstairs area, you will find his chest, unlocked with the key you claimed from his body. Inside are all of his embalming tools, along with the first part of his Journal. When reading through it, it becomes apparent that the untimely death of his sister Lucilla drove him to madness and that the murders, body parts, and necromancer rituals were all part of a desperate attempt to bring her back to life."

Return to Kodlak.","The Price of Power[edit] After completing two radiant quests for the Companions (one of which must be for Aela), your next major assignment will be available, courtesy of the elderly Harbinger himself, Kodlak Whitemane. He will chastise you for your actions against the Silver Hand, and will then tell you the true story about how the Companions contracted Lycanthropy. Apparently, one of his predecessors made a pact with the Glenmoril Witches to gain more power, not knowing the true price of his actions: an afterlife spent in Hircine's Hunting Grounds, not in Sovngarde. It is this fate which compels Kodlak to seek a cure. He then sends you off by yourself, in search of the Glenmoril Witches. The Coven[edit] Glenmoril Coven is located in the northwest reaches of Falkreath, southeast of Lost Valley Redoubt. Upon entering, proceed to the main chamber where you will encounter the first Glenmoril Witch, a powerful variety of Hagraven. She will attack you on sight, accompanied by a Frostbite Spider or Skeever. After the battle, claim her head. The chamber functions as a nexus to four smaller chambers, each with a witch and some valuable loot. The Destruction skill book The Horror of Castle Xyr is in a tent in the northwestern chamber and the Enchanting skill book A Tragedy in Black is in the northernmost chamber. While it is optional to kill all five witches, killing at least four is recommended if you want to cure yourself of lycanthropy later on. Despite the described weight of the heads, no weight penalty is added when you pick them up as quest items. Jorrvaskr  Attacked![edit] When you return to Whiterun, things will be different and you will notice several citizens gathered around near the stairs leading to Jorrvaskr. Halfway up the stairs, you will find both Torvar and Aela the Huntress next to dead Silver Hand members. When you enter the building, Vilkas will seek you out and ask you where you were in the time of need. In your absence, the Silver Hand attacked Jorrvaskr, managing to kill old Kodlak and take off with all the fragments of Wuuthrad. You will find Kodlak's dead body near the central fireplace, with Farkas and Njada Stonearm kneeling next to him; both unresponsive. Vilkas will claim that his death will be avenged, which will end the quest and immediately start the next one, Purity of Revenge."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bloodline","Escort Serana to Castle Volkihar. Speak to Lord Harkon. Either join Volkihar or remain loyal to the Dawnguard.","""I offer you my blood. Take it, and you will walk as a lion among sheep. Men will tremble at your approach, and you will never fear death again."" Serana in her sarcophagus Serana stumbles out of her sarcophagus Once you've found Serana and opened her sarcophagus at the end of Awakening, she will stumble out; disorientated after being asleep for a very long time. She asks you to take her to her father at Castle Volkihar, but before this you can ask her some questions after she initiates a conversation. This exchange will be different depending on whether or not you're a vampire: If You're Not a Vampire[edit] Serana initiates the conversation. ""Unh... where is... who sent you here?"" You have three lines of conversation, all of which lead to Serana commenting on you not being ""like her."" Who were you expecting?  A man named Isran.  That's not your concern.   I was expecting someone... like me, at least.  I... don't know who that is. Is he... like me?  I think it is, actually. Why would someone who isn't... like me... come all the way down here? It continues with: What do you mean, ""like you""?  Are you a...   A... can't you tell just from looking at me? A vampire.  Vampire, yes. You can either deliver a notice of hostility or ignore her vampirism. The Dawnguard would want me to kill you.  Why were you locked away like this?†   Not fond of vampires, are they? Well, look. Kill me, you've killed one vampire. But if people are after me, there is something bigger going on. I can help you find out what that is.  That's... complicated. And I'm not totally sure if I can trust you. But if you want to know the whole story, help me get back to my family's home. †You can ask this question again in few seconds, to which she gives an almost identical reply. At this point, your only option is to agree to escort her home. The only question is how you'd word it. Where do you need to go?  As long as you don't get in the way.   (No retorts)  I was going to say the same thing to you.   My family used to live on an island to the west of Solitude. I would guess they still do. By the way... my name is Serana. Good to meet you. If You're a Vampire[edit] ""Unh... where is... who sent you here?"" Ask her who she's expecting  Tell her who sent you    Who were you expecting? ""I was expecting someone from my family. I don't recognize you. Are you one of my father's little acolytes?""   A man named Isran. ""I... don't know who that is. Is he working for my father?"" That's not your concern. ""I think it is, actually. Are you one of my father's little acolytes?"" You'll be faced with another round of options after the initial introduction. Ask who her father is  Tell her who you're with    Who's your father? ""He's a very powerful man. Or he was at one point. I'm surprised another vampire hasn't heard of him."" How did you know I was a vampire? ""You think I can't tell my own kind?"" You're a vampire? ""Can't you tell your own kind?I smelled you almost before my eyes were open.""   No, a group called the ""Dawnguard"" sent me here. ""That's not a name I know. And it doesn't sound like a name a group of vampires would choose."" How did you know I was a vampire? ""You think I can't tell my own kind?"" You're a vampire? ""Can't you tell your own kind?I smelled you almost before my eyes were open."" The conversation continues regardless of what you pick. The Dawnguard would want me to kill you. ""Don't think that'll keep them from turning on you eventually. They'll figure out what you are."" Why were you locked away like this? ""That's... complicated. And I'm not totally sure if I can trust you. But if you want to know the whole story, help me get back to my family's home."" Where do you need to go? ""My family used to live on an island to the west of Solitude. I would guess they still do. By the way... my name is Serana. Good to meet you."" As long as you don't get in the way. ""I was going to say the same thing to you."" Other Topics[edit] You can also speak to her about general topics before escaping Dimhollow Crypt: ""My family used to live on an island to the west of Solitude. I would guess they still do. By the way... my name is Serana. Good to meet you."" Any idea how to get out of here? ""Your guess is as good as mine. This place looks pretty different from when I was locked away."" You can also ask her about her home. Tell me about your home. ""It's on an island near Solitude. Hopefully we can find a boat to take us there. It's my family home. Not the most welcoming place, but depending on who's around, I'll be safe there."" Why wouldn't you be safe there? ""Let's just say that my mother and father had a bit of a falling out. Don't worry, I'm not in any danger or anything like that. It'll just be more unpleasant to run into my father."" Someone you don't want to see? ""My father and I don't really get along. Ugh, saying it out loud makes it sound so... common. ""Little girl who doesn't get along with her father."" Read that story a hundred times."" You can also ask about the Elder Scroll on her back. Is that an Elder Scroll? ""Yes, it is, and it's mine."" Why do you have an Elder Scroll? ""It's... complicated. I can't really talk about it. I'm sorry."" Is it fragile? Do we need to be careful with it? ""Ha. Nothing can destroy an Elder Scroll. Worry more about protecting your hide, and let me worry about my things."" You can touch on how long she's been out. How long were you in there? ""Good question. Hard to say. I... I can't really tell. I feel like it was a long time. Who is Skyrim's High King?"" Giving a Stormcloak-supporting answer  Giving an Empire-supporting answer  Stay neutral    Ulfric Stormcloak is the true High King. ""I've... never heard of him. Is he well supported?""   Elisif of Solitude will be High Queen. ""I don't know that name. You say she's Jarl of Solitude? Who supports her?""   That's actually a matter of debate. ""Oh, wonderful. A war of succession. Good to know the world didn't get boring while I was gone. Who are the contenders?"" Regardless of how you answer, the conversation continues. The Empire supports Elisif, but there are many in Skyrim loyal to Ulfric. ""Empire? What... what empire?"" The... Empire. From Cyrodiil. ""Cyrodiil is the seat of an empire? I must have been gone longer than I thought. Definitely longer than we planned. Please, let's hurry. I need to get home so I can figure out what's happened."" You can also ask her why she was locked away. Why were you locked away? ""I'd... rather not get into that with you. If that's all right. I'm sorry, it's not that... it's just that I don't know who I can trust yet. Let's get to my home, and I'll have a better sense of where we all stand."" Escape the Crypt[edit] Once the conversation is complete, you can escape the crypt. Exit the cavern by crossing the small stone bridge on the opposite side of the room you came in from. You will be ambushed by two gargoyles; to which Serana yells ""Look out! Gargoyles!"". Once you've dealt with them, find the door to the right and enter a small chamber. If you get lost during the escape, Serana will comment on this with a few remarks: ""So I'm thinking that wasn't the right way."" ""All right, so obviously not this way, either."" ""Well, we're definitely not going to find our way out from here. Do you... know what you're doing?"" ""This feels like the right way. I was starting to worry."" The gate to the next room is opened by a lever which also releases a number of skeletons and draugr. Through the gate is a large amphitheater room with several leveled undead (including a boss-level draugr, or an unnamed Dragon Priest if above level 45), a boss chest and the Drain Vitality Word Wall. Behind the Word Wall is an altar with a few coin purses and two random enchanted weapons. Head out through the gated door at the opposite end of the room from where you came in and exit Dimhollow Crypt. When you finally escape Dimhollow Crypt, Serana will say: ""Ah, it's so good to breathe again!"" As you travel with Serana to her castle, she will comment on the weather occasionally: ""Even in this weather, it's better than the cave."" (cloudy, fog, overcast or storm) ""This weather is incredible."" (anything else) If you try to bring her to Fort Dawnguard, she will comment: ""I don't like the feel of this place. I'll wait for you back by the entrance."". Castle Volkihar[edit] The castle is in the northwest corner of the map. The fastest way to reach the castle is to take the boat at Icewater Jetty, which is reachable on foot or fast traveling to Northwatch Keep and walking the remaining distance to the boat. It's also possible to hire a ferryman, but when asking to be taken to the island, they all reply with: ""The one with the ruined castle? Don't you know that place is cursed? Even seasoned sailors steer far around that place. I'll take you as far as I can, but I'm not hanging around and it's gonna cost you extra."" and drop you off at the jetty. They part with a few cautionary words: ""They say anyone who steps foot on that island will meet an early death... hope you know what you're doing."" Once you are near the castle, Serana will say: ""That's it, out there to the north. We used to keep a boat around here to get there and back."" Once you arrive at Icewater Jetty she will say: ""Umm... this is the part where we usually get in the boat. You with me?"" Activate the boat and you will arrive at a small dock with Castle Volkihar looming in the background. Bone hawks circle overhead and a stone bridge lined with gargoyles leads to the main gate. About halfway across the bridge, Serana will initiate conversation: ""What now?"" This is your home? ""This is it. Home sweet... castle."" Why didn't you tell me it was so huge? ""I didn't want you to think I was one of those... you know, the women who just sit in their castle all day? I don't know. Coming from a place like this, well... it's not really me. I hope you can believe that."" It's impressive. ""It's something all right."" The next part can vary depending upon if you are a vampire or not. You are given three options to reply: If you're not a vampire  If you are a vampire:    ""Hey, so... before we go in there...""   What is it? ""I wanted to thank you for getting me this far. But after we get in there, I'm going to go my own way for a while. I think... It's not about you! You've been so great in getting me back here.I know your friends would probably want to kill everything in here. I'm hoping you can show some more control than that. Once we're inside, just keep quiet for a bit. Let me take the lead."" Are you all right? ""I think so. And thanks for asking.I know your friends would probably want to kill everything in here. I'm hoping you can show some more control than that. Once we're inside, just keep quiet for a bit. Let me take the lead."" What is it now? ""Fine, don't worry about it. When we get in, you won't have to babysit me anymore.""   ""Hey, so... before we go in there...""   What is it? ""I wanted to thank you for getting me this far. But after we get in there, I'm going to go my own way for a while. I think... It's not about you! You've been so great in getting me back here.I just need to be alone. For a while. There's a lot of feelings wrapped up in this old place, and I don't think you're quite ready for them. So let me take the lead in here."" Are you all right? ""I think so. And thanks for asking.I just need to be alone. For a while. There's a lot of feelings wrapped up in this old place, and I don't think you're quite ready for them. So let me take the lead in here."" What is it now? ""Fine, don't worry about it. When we get in, you won't have to babysit me anymore."" As you approach the gate, the Watchman will initially berate you, saying: ""Begone! You're not welcome here!"" Then, upon seeing Serana with, he'll be shocked and say, ""Lady Serana's back! Open the gate!"" and lead you both into the castle. Once you open the door and step into Volkihar Keep you are confronted by a vampire named Vingalmo. He yells: ""How dare you trespass here!"" but upon seeing Serana will joyfully exclaim: ""Wait... Serana? Is that truly you? I cannot believe my eyes! My lord! Everyone! Serana has returned!"" Serana will walk over to the balcony overlooking the main hall as Harkon welcomes his daughter home: Harkon: ""My long-lost daughter returns at last. I trust you have my Elder Scroll?""   Serana: ""After all these years, that's the first thing you ask me? Yes, I have the scroll.""   Harkon: ""Of course I'm delighted to see you, my daughter. Must I really say the words aloud? Ah, if only your traitor mother were here, I would let her watch this reunion before putting her head on a spike. Now tell me, who is this stranger you have brought into our hall?""   Serana: ""This is my savior, the one who freed me.""   Harkon: ""For my daughter's safe return, you have my gratitude. Tell me, what is your name?""     ""My long-lost daughter returns at last. I trust you have my Elder Scroll?"" At this point you can either give him your name or ask him to reveal his first. Either choice leads to the same follow up: ""I am Harkon, lord of this court. By now, my daughter will have told you what we are."" Three choices are presented: You're vampires: ""Not just vampires. We are among the oldest and most powerful vampires in Skyrim."" You're a reclusive cannibal cult: ""Not quite, though I can see how an outsider might arrive at that conclusion. No, we are vampires, among the oldest and most powerful in Skyrim."" I don't really care what you are: ""Perhaps you should. I count some of the oldest and most powerful vampires in Skyrim among the members of my court."" ""I offer you my blood. Take it, and you will walk as a lion among sheep. Men will tremble at your approach, and you will never fear death again."" He will expand on either of the above by mentioning: ""For centuries we lived here, far from the cares of the world. All that ended when my wife betrayed me and stole away that which I valued most."" Should you ignore him and walk away mid conversation, he becomes irritated and remarks: ""You dare walk away from me? In my own hall, before my own court, you dare insult me?"" or ""We have not finished speaking yet. Come back at once."" The next set of questions relate to a potential reward, which results in Lord Harkon offering to bestow the power of a Vampire Lord unto you: What happens now?: ""You have done me a great service, and now you must be rewarded. There is but one gift I can give that is equal in value to the Elder Scroll and my daughter. I offer you my blood. Take it, and you will walk as a lion among sheep. Men will tremble at your approach, and you will never fear death again."" Do I get a reward for finding your daughter?: ""I was about to suggest that very thing. Yes, you most certainly deserve a reward. There is but one gift I can give that is equal in value to the Elder Scroll and my daughter. I offer you my blood. Take it, and you will walk as a lion among sheep. Men will tremble at your approach, and you will never fear death again."" The last set of questions are dependent upon if you are already a Vampire, Werewolf or neither. Upon choosing the last option, Harkon demonstrates his immense power by transforming into a Vampire Lord himself: ""Behold the power I offer!"" Your Dialogue  Harkon's Reply  Condition   I'm already a vampire. What more can you offer me?  ""You contracted a disease, perhaps, but you are no true vampire. Accept my gift and I promise that you will learn the difference. Refuse me, and I will banish you from this castle. I will spare your life this once, but after that, you are prey.""  You are a Vampire   I'm a werewolf. What will happen if I accept your gift?  ""Yes, I can smell it on you. The power of my blood will purge that filth and make you whole again.""  You are a Werewolf   And if I refuse your gift?  ""Then you will be prey, like all mortals. I will spare your life this once, but you will be banished from this hall. Perhaps you still need convincing? Behold the power! This is the power that I offer! Now, make your choice!""  Default choice As Harkon stands in front of you in his Vampire Lord form, you are forced to either refuse or accept his offer: ""I will accept your gift and become a vampire.""  ""I don't want to become a vampire. I refuse.""   By accepting Harkon's offer, he urges you to stand still as he lunges forward and bites your neck, causing your vision to fade out. You awaken in the castle's catherdral, where Harkon stands ready to teach you how to use your newly acquired powers.  By refusing his offer Harkon replies: ""So be it!"" and casts a spell upon you, causing your vision to fade out. This results in banishment from the castle and you are transported to the rocky coast just outside the castle with no other option but to report back to Isran.  Choosing Vampire Lord[edit] If you choose to become a Vampire Lord, Harkon will bite you as everything fades out. When you wake up, you and Harkon will be in the Volkihar Cathedral. Harkon will begin teaching you how to use your Vampire Lord powers, which include raising dead and draining life, as well as a claw attack. He also explains a few things, such as his history and that of his family, if you ask him about them. Once you are done getting acquainted with your new powers, you will be given a quest to fill The Bloodstone Chalice.  Power of the Blood[edit]  ""The true power of the ancient blood is found in the form of the Vampire Lord. Assume the mantle of the Vampire Lord, and we will continue."" If you accept Harkon's offer, you awaken in the castle's cathedral where Harkon stands before an altar and remarks: ""Awake at last, good. The power is growing within you, and now you must learn to wield it."". At this point, three replies are presented. The first is option leads into a short training session with Harkon, who teaches you how to you the power of the Vampire Lord:  I'm ready to learn about my new powers. ""With my guidance you will become a deadly instrument, striking terror in the hearts of mortals wherever you tread. Now, listen to my words and do as I instruct. The true power of the ancient blood is found in the form of the Vampire Lord. Assume the mantle of the Vampire Lord, and we will continue."" Once you transform into Vampire Lord, Harkon follows with:  ""In this form, you can drain the life from your foes with your right hand. With your left hand, you can wield the power of blood magic to raise the dead. You can also call upon the powers of night to turn into a swarm of bats and reappear some distance away. Should you run out of magicka, you can descend to the ground and fight as the beasts do. Do so now and we will continue."" As you land on the ground, he goes on:  ""Good. You are weaker while on the ground, because you cannot access the blood magic. However, the night powers are still yours to command, and your claws are still formidable weapons. Over time, your powers will grow in strength and you will find new ways to use your gifts."" Next you are prompted to view the perk tree. After exiting, Harkon continues:   ""There is much to learn, but if you master the powers of the Vampire Lord, few enemies will be able to stand against you."" Finally, once you select the list of powers from the favorites menu, Harkon ends with:  ""There is one last thing you must know. Slaying mortal men with your life drain grants you new night powers and blood magic. I keep a stable of thralls in the castle should you need to feed like the baser vampires to stave off the sun. That is all I have to teach you. If you wish to be reminded of these lessons, you need only ask. I have a task that will test your new powers, but first, do you have any questions?"" At this stage, three more dialogue options are presented that allow you to gain additional information about your newly found powers. Choosing first option end the conversation.   I'm ready to carry out this task: ""Good. Go and speak to Garan Marethi. Tell him it is time. He will understand."" Tell me again about being a Vampire Lord: ""When you first transform into a Vampire Lord, you will hover in the air. While you do, you will command the powers of Blood and Night. Descend to the ground, and you can attack with your claws and feed upon your prey to regain your strength. With experience, your powers will grow and you will discover new ways to use them."" What must I know about being a vampire?: ""With each passing day that you do not feed, that weakness will become more deadly, but your powers will also become stronger. Feed upon those who are sleeping, and your vulnerability to sunlight will diminish along with your powers."" The second and third of the original three choices offer additional insight into Harkon's background and the power he has granted you:  What happened? How did I get here? ""My blood is potent. At first, the body is overwhelmed by it. After my bite, you collapsed and fell into a slumber. Now your flesh has acclimated to the new blood that courses through your veins. I assure you, no harm was done. In truth, your strength surprises me. Not all mortals can withstand my embrace."" What is this place? A shrine to Molag Bal, the mighty Daedra Prince who is father to all our kind. Our power is a blessing from him. It is he who first bestowed the gift of the ancient blood upon me."" You made a pact with Molag Bal?: ""In an age long forgotten to history, I ruled as a mighty king. My domain was vast, my riches endless and my power infinite. And yet, as my mortal life neared an end, I faced a seemingly invincible enemy -- my own mortality. I pledged myself to Molag Bal, and in his name I sacrificed a thousand innocents. In reward, he gave everlasting life to myself, my wife and my daughter. And so I have defeated mortality itself.""  Choosing Dawnguard[edit] A skirmish between the Dawnguard and the vampires If you decide to stick with the Dawnguard and refuse his offer, Lord Harkon will cast a spell that will teleport you outside the Castle gate. He also ""advises"" you to never return. With the castle locked behind you, your only remaining option is to return to Fort Dawnguard and report this new discovery to the Dawnguard. Once you arrive, you will find the fortress under attack by a band of vampires. After defeating the vampire attackers, you should speak to Isran and tell him what you discovered. Following this report, he will give you the duty of seeking out some of his old allies to create A New Order. Following the Dawnguard side of the questline will cause Fort Dawnguard to be rebuilt and refurnished. You will also have access to Crossbow upgrades and Armored Trolls."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Bloodstone_Chalice","Speak with Garan Marethi. Fill the chalice at Redwater Den. Defeat Stalf and Salonia Caelia. Return to Garan Marethi.","Garan arguing with Vingalmo and Orthjolf Having completed Bloodline and accepted Lord Harkon's gift, speak to Garan Marethi to deliver Harkon's message. Though vague, he will understand and tell you about the Bloodstone Chalice, an artifact able to increase the potency of vampire powers. He'll ask you to follow him to the artifact; along the way, you'll come across Orthjolf and Vingalmo, whose interest in your task hints towards things to come. Garan: ""Excuse us. I need to fetch the Bloodstone Chalice."" Vingalmo: ""The Chalice? Why?"" Orthjolf: ""What're you up to, Garan?"" Garan: ""Lord Harkon's orders, Orthjolf. Calm yourself. Our friend here has been ordered to fill the Chalice."" Orthjolf: ""Really?"" Garan: ""Indeed. He/She's off to Redwater Den."" Vingalmo: ""Well, then... Best of luck to you."" Continue on to the chalice room, where Garan will give you your detailed orders. You'll need to travel to Redwater Den and fill the Chalice from the Bloodspring there. Once that's done, you'll need to add the blood of a powerful vampire to it. Garan will warn you that Redwater Den is inhabited by ""less reputable members of society"", and send you on your way. You can now ask Garan for more information about the bloodspring, and he'll tell you that although it looks like blood, it unfortunately isn't, but still has powerful potential nevertheless. Travel to Redwater Den, a skooma trading hub. Approaching what looks like an abandoned shack, there are two lookouts keeping watch, who will direct you downstairs, assuming you're there for skooma. After entering through the trapdoor in the back, you will have to pass by a doorman who warns you to ""keep your weapons to yourself"" before allowing you to enter the door. Downstairs, you'll find a Dealer behind a locked, gated counter, and past her, a corridor of booths set up for enjoying skooma. There are various NPCs through here who are currently under the effects of the Redwater Skooma, content to ignore you and get their fix. Walking along the corridor is an attendant who will tell you ""That door is locked for a reason"" if you approach the locked gate at the end of the hall with him nearby. From this point there are two ways to continue on, both leading to the same destination: Pick the lock at the gate, turning the dealer and the attendant hostile should they see you. (Note: After finishing the quest, everyone left alive except the Dealer will be a vampire thrall on your return, some hostile. You may wish to kill them all ahead of time to avoid later inconvenience.) After dealing with them you will enter a large open area filled with various alchemy ingredients, vampires, and their thralls. Fighting your way up the large ramp will lead you past a bridge with a lever, then more corridors. Slowly the amount of enemies will lessen, and Death Hounds will start joining the fights, until you reach a large open room filled with solely vampires and their hounds. Alternatively, if you approach the Dealer, you either have the option of buying some Redwater Skooma, or passing a persuasion check and getting a ""free sample"" from her. Either way, after drinking it your vision will go blurry, and you will wake up in a cage within large dim room filled with vampires. Unlocking the gate nearby will put you back on the same path as above, allowing you to continue forward from the same point. The cage has a copy of the Spell Tome - Telekinesis. Regardless of the option chosen, you will end up in a large open area full of vampires and thralls, who you can overhear discussing the spring: Thrall: ""So why don't you just drink the blood from the spring? I mean, that seems easier than running a skooma den..."" Vampire: ""The boss said it's some sort of profaned spring. It looks like blood, but it's not the real thing. Drinking it gives you strength, but it also gets you pretty messed up... That's why we thought of putting it in the skooma."" Be careful during the fight against these vampires as there is a gate on the ground that is extremely hard to see due to the low lighting; if step on it, it will open—drop you in a spike pit below the room and require you to climb the spiral ramp back out. Continuing on, you will head up a ramp to the east which leads to a pull chain — opening the gate to your left as well as a door directly across from you. From here, you will follow through a fairly linear set of corridors and rooms lined with coffins, most patrolled by vampires and Death Hounds. If you see a Death Hound, there is a good chance it is closely followed by its master. Following along you will encounter Venarus Vulpin. Kill him and take the key to the next door from his body, and finally you will reach the end of the dungeon—the Bloodspring. Approaching the spring will prompt you to fill the Chalice; upon doing so, two vampires, Stalf ‎and Salonia Caelia, will enter through the back door. After a short conversation between themselves, it becomes clear that you are to become the latest casualty in Vingalmo and Orthjolf's politicking. (Don't attack them without allowing them to argue, or that will make you a traitor in Lord Harkon's court.) Salonia: ""It's really too bad, you know. The little accident you had here, completely unexpected..."" Stalf: ""Yeah, too bad. Lord Harkon's new favorite, dead so soon after joining the family."" Salonia: ""We're just lucky I was here to return the Chalice to Vingalmo, so he could make sure Harkon gets it back."" Stalf: ""Wait, what? That's not what we agreed. We take it back together."" Salonia: ""Idiot. You didn't really think I'd let you walk out of here either, did you? Vingalmo wants you both dead."" Stalf: ""Well that's just fine. Orthjolf told me to finish off anyone who got in the way."" The restored Bloodstone Chalice in Castle Volkihar They will then become hostile towards you. Eliminate them both. Once dispatched, your quest journal will be updated with the objective to ""Fill the chalice with the blood of an ancient vampire"" which requires you to select one of the two you just killed, filling the rest of the Chalice with their blood. Take the door they entered from, which is now unlocked, and you'll find that it leads up to the main area of the skooma den, ending up leading through a hidden door in the stockroom behind the dealer's counter. Once back in the main room, whatever inhabitants are still alive will be vampire thralls. Make your way past these, and return to Garan to tell him what happened. Garan will explain to you that Vingalmo and Orthjolf long for Harkon's throne, but can't make overt moves against him; this is why each sent an underling to kill you and return with the Chalice. Robbed of their servants, neither of them will be able to act against him through them any more. He comments on the politics of the court and warns you to be careful who you trust. He then informs you that Harkon wishes to speak to you himself, leading to the next quest."

Arriving at Faldar's Tooth, there is a bandit labeled 'Bouncer' and 2 pit wolves outside. As you enter, there is another bandit labeled 'Bouncer' immediately inside. Straight ahead through the narrow passageway, turn right into the main room. You come out on a wooden deck, with barrels and sacks to your left, and stairs down to your right. The room has a cage in the middle, with 2 fighting wolves inside. There are 2 gamblers and a barkeep who will all become hostile to you as you enter.

Read his journal and free Gogh from the fighting pit.","Creatures from the South[edit] Upon installing the Goblins Creation, you can go to the Bee and Barb in Riften, where in a room upstairs you will find a Letter to Clexius. This piece of personal correspondence describes a tribe of Cyrodilic Goblins who have invaded a cave known as Gromm's Pass. By all accounts, they seem to be led by the ""Blue God"", an aspect of Malacath worshipped by Goblins. You'll have to head there to investigate. Cave Crawling[edit] A Goblin heretic fighting back Gromm's Pass is a new cave added by this Creation. The entrance can be found in the valley directly south of Forelhost. It is notable for being filled with hostile Goblins as well as a unique type of mushroom called Steel-Blue Entoloma‎‎. This plant is added by the Creation and cannot be found elsewhere, although it can be grown in Fertile Soil so it would be advisable to harvest a few samples while you're there. While exploring the cave, you will soon come across the body of Avanessa Calladius, the mage whose letter you found. On her corpse you will find a copy of The Posting of the Hunt, a book which describes the legendary Spear of Bitter Mercy. The relevance of this will soon become apparent, once you step foot inside the cave's central chamber where a Goblin wielding this legendary Spear is currently battling for his life inside an enclosed fighting pit. You likely won't have time to watch the fight, as the chamber also serves as a throne room for the Blue God. Kill him and his Goblin minions in order to loot the powerful Goblin Totem Staff from his corpse. You will also have to read his journal, which reveals that this supposed manifestation of the Blue God was actually just a hapless tribal Orc who covered himself in Steel-Blue Entoloma‎‎ paste to trick the invading Goblins into following him. Unfortunately, the underground passage to Cyrodiil has since collapsed. A Grateful Goblin[edit] Once you've had a chance to read the journal, you will be directed to free the surviving Goblin in the fighting pit, where he was thrown after figuring out the Orc's trickery. His name is Gogh, and he will be more than happy to join you as a follower for saving him from the pit. He acts similarly to the Riekling Warrior follower from Dragonborn and can be spoken to at length despite his rather lacking vocabulary. You have the option to change his outfit visually, but you cannot take the Spear of Bitter Mercy. It is left unclear as to why exactly a Goblin is in possession of a powerful Daedric artifact, but he will use it to great effect as a follower, using it to perform attacks and summon storm atronachs. Gogh cannot be commanded to stay at any of your houses. If he leaves your service, he will return to the throne area in Gromm's Pass."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Boethiah%27s_Calling","(Optional) Read Boethiah's Proving. Travel to the Sacellum of Boethiah and speak to the Priestess of Boethiah. Sacrifice a follower on the Altar of Sacrifice. Kill all the cult members. Go to Knifepoint Ridge and kill Boethiah's current champion.","Starting the Quest[edit] You can start the quest any time after reaching level 30, either by reading a copy of Boethiah's Proving or traveling directly to the Sacellum of Boethiah and talking to the Priestess of Boethiah or killing every one of the cultists. If you wait, you may be attacked randomly in the world by Boethiah cultists, who will have a copy of Boethiah's Proving on their corpse. Note: See Boethiah's Proving for other locations of the book. The various copies of the book appear once you reach level 30. The Shrine of Boethiah[edit] First, you will have to make your way to the Sacellum of Boethiah. Follow the road northeast from the Windhelm Stables up to Traitor's Post. Nearby is a road that leads into the mountains, up to the Sacellum. When you arrive at the Sacellum you will find two cultists fighting in a small arena. There are some more cultists and a Priestess of Boethiah watching them. Speak to the priestess. She will tell you that you need to prove that ""your tongue can wield a lie"". If you kill the followers of Boethiah, the Daedric Prince will appear and give the quest instructions herself; this will only change the order in which you complete the tasks. The Sacrifice[edit] The priestess will tell you that you need to gain someone's trust and then sacrifice them before Boethiah. She will give you the Blade of Sacrifice to use for the deed.  Lead any non-essential follower to the shrine and activate command mode (holding 'use' or via the ""I need you to do something"" conversation option). Highlight the pillar and you should see ""Use the Pillar of Sacrifice"". Tell them to do this and they will move towards it and be pulled in and stuck to it. If the follower is essential, the pillar will not be triggered. Kill the follower using any means (despite what the Priestess says, you do not have to use the Blade of Sacrifice). Once your follower is dead, Boethiah will use the body as a conduit to tell you and all of the cultists that she has a task for whomever is left standing after a battle to the death. This results in all the cultists attacking one another (and you). Be prepared for a tough fight, as they can be formidable opponents. Alternatively, you can leave your follower on the Pillar of Sacrifice, kill all of the cultists until one is left, lead the last cultist to the Pillar of Sacrifice, get the last cultist's health to low, then kill your follower and the last cultist simultaneously. If done correctly, your follower will survive, their services should be available once again, and Boethiah will take the form of the last cultist instead. If you have already killed all the followers of Boethiah, she will then possess the corpse of the last follower you slew and the quest proceeds as normal. See Notes. The New Champion[edit] The Ebony Mail After making the sacrifice and killing all the cultists, Boethiah will again use a body as a conduit (it may not be the same one) and tell you she needs a new champion. To become the new champion you must kill the old champion and his bandits at Knifepoint Ridge, northwest of Falkreath. Despite Boethiah's order to kill them stealthily, being detected does not result in quest failure or any other penalty.  Nonetheless, most of the bandits inside the mine are busy with their backs to you and can be assassinated. A few are standing in pools of flammable liquid that can be ignited with fire spells.  It's difficult to sneak up on Boethiah's Champion because of the direction he faces when sitting, but if you climb on top of his shack, you can drop down behind him. Once you defeat Boethiah's Champion, you must equip his Ebony Mail.  Boethiah will then speak to you one last time, telling you that you are her new champion and giving you the Ebony Mail as your reward."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bolstering_the_Ranks","Speak with Sorine Jurard. Speak with Isran. Travel to Ruunvald Excavation. Find Florentius Baenius.","A Secret Request[edit] ""Gunmar and I have been talking"" After recruiting Sorine Jurard and Gunmar into the Dawnguard during the quest A New Order, Isran will send you on a hunt for Dexion Evicus, a Moth priest traveling around Skyrim, starting the quest Prophet. During your search for the priest, you will find that vampires have taken Dexion hostage inside Forebears' Holdout. At that point in the quest (stage 60), Sorine and Gunmar will have settled down in Fort Dawnguard's western area, and while keeping up appearances, they have secretly discussed the vampire threat. Sorine will ask you directly: ""Do you have a moment? Gunmar and I have been talking and, well, we're slightly worried. We both realized that if Isran's even allowed us in here, he must be really concerned. And if he's that concerned, the situation must be pretty bad. Make sense?"" She then admits that she and Gunmar agreed that they could use the help of one 'Florentius', a former priest of Arkay and quite eccentric. The problem is Isran and Florentius have a past, and Isran obviously dislikes the priest. Another problem is that Isran is the only one who knows the location of Florentius, and she leaves it to you to get the information. This starts the quest and you will have to seek out Isran, although Sorine encourages you to keep her involvement a secret. When confronted with the request, Isran will immediately guess the persons responsible: ""Who said something, Sorine or Gunmar? I thought they'd have learned their lesson by now. I don't trust that man, and I don't want him here."" He then reckons the Dawnguard can use all the help they can get and will point you towards Ruunvald, an excavation site recently explored by Vigilants of Stendarr, including Florentius, with the comment: ""If he can maintain some appearance of normalcy, I'll allow him to stay."" The Charmed Vigilants[edit] A Charmed Vigilant The Ruunvald Excavation is located on the mountainside east of Shor's Stone and consists of a tent and what appears to be a mine entrance. Examine the tent for a journal, the personal observations of a Vigilant named Volk. The journal mentions that Volk and Florentius both had the tiresome job of guarding the entrance, until they were finally invited to join the dig by a Vigilant named Apa. Although the two guards were beginning to find the whole situation suspicious, they clearly ventured into the mines as ordered, and you will have to do the same. I am certain we are digging in the right place. I can feel it in my bones, and I dream of finding Ruunvald at night. Even in my waking hours, I can almost hear a reassuring voice telling me we are going the right way. Upon entering, you can hear digging noises from below, so head down the slope to the woodworks set up by the Vigilants and notice the person standing on the adjacent platform, without moving at all. As you get closer you will see an odd red fog covering his face, and when he notices you he will immediately attack and identify himself as a Charmed Vigilant. From the chamber behind you, another Vigilant will rush to his aid, so dispose of them both and examine the first chamber for a locked chest with minor loot and, on a crate next to the northern tunnel, Discovering Ruunvald, Vol. I, a detailed journal written by Moric Sidrey, the Vigilant who discovered the place. Dream of Ruunvald[edit] Husky attacks! Proceed through the northern tunnel until you reach an intersection with a patrolling Vigilant and a booby-trapped oil slick. Use the oil to your advantage or pick the fight and beware of another Vigilant near the malachite vein to the northwest. Head down the southern tunnel and claim the contents of a minor loot chest. Proceed forward until you reach a large room with two Vigilants and a husky. Take them all down and examine the southwestern corner for several useful potions near a bedroll. In the center of the room, on a crate near another bedroll, sits Discovering Ruunvald, Vol. II with more of Moric Sidrey's detailed observations on the dig, along with some unsettling personal issues. It must have something to do with the cramped spaces, but I have found myself prone to aches in my head. While these hardly deter me from my leadership role, I have found myself distracted at times. I have had many a conversation with the workers where I drift off, only to have them call me back to reality. Sometimes I lose small amounts of time and can't remember what I've done. Locate the narrow tunnel to the east and proceed forward as it twists and turns. A locked chest can be found under the woodworks ahead, and, further down the tunnel, yet another Vigilant accompanied by a husky. A huge wooden scaffold leads down into the next chamber, obviously used by the hardworking Vigilants as storage, as several crates and barrels are stacked up, along with a bookshelf with common books. On the table near the shelf, guarded by a Vigilant, is volume III of the journal, detailing not only his own recurring headaches, but headaches among his crew of Vigilants as well. However, despite the pain and blackouts, the dig continued, even if Moric Sidrey's attention turned away from Ruunwald towards something else in the depths of the mine. I dream we'll finally reach Ruunvald, and I can't help but reflect on what this will mean to my reputation! My family will be so proud, especially my father, Minorne. He and mother have always been interested in my studies, even if my sister Minorne was not. But I'm most excited to reveal my findings to my colleagues, Minorne and Minorne, and perhaps my mentor Minorne. Oh, won't they all be pleased? Discovering Ruunvald[edit] The entrance to Ruunvald Temple The next area contains more crates and barrels, along with three pressure plates triggering mounted crossbows, so dodge the plates and proceed through the northern tunnel into a huge chamber filled with Nordic architecture, a hanging bridge, and several Charmed Vigilants. After fighting your way over the bridge, one of the attackers will have a familiar name, specifically Volk, who initially guarded the entrance with Florentius but was charmed along with his colleagues. Before heading downstairs, examine the enclosed western room for a chest. At the bottom of the large chamber, examine the northeastern corner for an owned bed, a chest, and some food. This chamber also marks the spot where Moric and his crew finally broke through the right wall and found the entrance to Ruunvald Temple. However, the fourth and final volume of Moric Sidrey's journal, which can be found on a barrel near the entrance to the Temple, reveals that Moric and his workers were all led to the Temple by a strange voice that slowly seduced them all. I have found my muse and her name is Minorne. Reading back over old journals, I realize she has called to me from deep inside Ruunvald. She is the voice I've been hearing, the one who has called me ever downwards into the mountain. The Vigilants, the workers, they hear her too! What joy to learn that I am not alone in her love! Oh, Minorne, how would we have ever found this place without you! As expected, Ruunvald Temple is a typical Nordic ruin, although no draugr enemies can be found here. Proceed down the first hallway to a table holding the book Minorne, the ramblings of former Vigilant of Stendarr Moric Sidrey, and a love letter to his new mistress in the depths of the ruin, Minorne. It details his eternal love and how he managed to lure even more Vigilants into the ruin, simply by lying. It also contains a clue to the whereabouts on your target, Florentius Baenius, and his hatred towards anyone who would harm his mistress: ""There are fools in this world that do not heed to her beautiful voice. The guard, Florentius, sent from the Beacon, he still prays to Arkay, an absentee god who pales in comparison to Minorne! I will pray to the goddess I can see! May he rot in his cage!"" The Mistress[edit] Minorne attacks Proceed down the available path until you reach a large chamber, with stairs leading up to an altar and a cage, and three shadowy figures wandering around. They turn out to be another Charmed Vigilant, Moric Sidrey himself, and his godly mistress Minorne, who is actually just an ordinary Altmer warlock, who is busy torturing the imprisoned Florentius for no apparent reason, using her leveled Destruction spells. All three will attack you on sight, so take them down and loot Minorne's corpse for the unique Staff of Ruunvald and the Ruunvald Key. ""Isran? My help? Is this... some kind of a joke?"" Inside the cage, Priest of Arkay Florentius Baenius will show little of the normalcy requested by Isran when he shows his gratitude: ""I knew you had it in you! Arkay wasn't so sure. Between you and me, I think he didn't expect you to make it. But not me! I knew it all along!"" He will then ask how he can repay you, so ask him to meet you at Fort Dawnguard and he will ask why. When you explain Isran needs his help he will be quite surprised: ""Isran? My help? Is this... some kind of a joke? Did Arkay put you up to this? Isran's done nothing but mock me. He's never given me the respect I deserve."" After you beg for his help, he will finally agree, but only due to strange voices in his head: ""Look, I've just gotten myself out of quite a mess here, in case you haven't noticed, and while I appreciate your help, I... What's that? No, that's not what I... Yes, but... Are you sure? Really? Fine. Arkay says it's a good idea for me to go. I don't agree, but he's not the sort of fellow you can just ignore. I'll see you at Fort Dawnguard, then. Don't worry, Arkay will show me the way."" He will then leave the ruin and the quest will finish. While Florentius takes the long way back through the mine, locate the southern door and unlock it with the key. It leads to the deceased warlock's private quarters and contains a boss-leveled chest, the quest-related book The Aetherium Wars, an alchemy lab, and a handle which reveals a hidden pathway back to Skyrim. The next time you visit Fort Dawnguard, Florentius will have changed into Dawnguard armor, opened up his shop as an alchemist, will be available as a master trainer in Restoration, and an alchemy lab will be found across from the arcane enchanter."

Find a potential spouse who you wish to marry and who is willing to marry you. Wear the Amulet of Mara and ask them to marry you. Go to the Temple of Mara and attend your wedding ceremony. Select a house for you and your new spouse to move into.","Arranging an Engagement[edit] Maramal performs a wedding at the temple in Riften If you are interested in getting married, you must first speak to Maramal in the city of Riften. He can initially be found in The Bee and Barb tavern preaching to the locals and later at the Temple of Mara. Talk to him about marriage and he will instruct you to obtain an Amulet of Mara; a holy symbol of the goddess of love. At this point, you may purchase one from him for a small fee, or find one in random loot throughout the game. Any Amulet of Mara will do, so if you already have one before speaking to Maramal, there is no need to buy one. Now you must find an NPC in whom you have an interest (A list of eligible NPCs can be found here). The person that you wish to marry must have a high disposition towards you. This can be achieved by doing favors and completing quests for that character. When you have met your ideal spouse, you must approach them while wearing the amulet. This will give you new dialogue options concerning marriage. Ask the person to marry you. If they agree, you will need to organize a wedding ceremony. Return to Maramal to tell him that you are interested in getting married at the Temple of Mara. He will be delighted and will announce that the wedding will take place the very next day; from dawn until dusk. The Ceremony[edit] Early the next morning your spouse will be waiting for you in the Temple of Mara. Upon entering the building, you will walk down the aisle and take part in an age-old tradition between two people. You will be required to say your vows, with prompting by Maramal. You are now legally married! The first decision you must make is where to live. You may live in your spouse's home or any house that you have purchased. This decision is not permanent; if at any time you want to change residences, choose the ""I'd like us to move somewhere else"" dialogue option."

Help Ruki with her love.","Dinya Balu is a priestess of the Temple of Mara in Riften, devoted to spreading the word and acts of the Divine. When you speak with her inside the temple, asking for Mara's blessing, she will explain that earthly services on Mara's behalf are first required. When you are ready to go forth, bearing Mara's light, Dinya explains the visions that Mara has given her, and asks you to act in Mara's name to aid those who are having trouble with their love. Fickle Love: Fastred[edit] Boti and Jofthor have differing opinions about their daughter's future. Dinya will first tell you of a young woman, confused and overwhelmed by her new found feelings. She will send you to Ivarstead to speak to Fastred, the conflicted girl. Fastred will tell you that she is in love with Bassianus Axius, but her parents will not let them be together; she will ask you to speak to them in that regard. Her mother, Boti, will reveal that she is not against the relationship, and even if Fastred were to run away with Bassianus, she would do her best to handle her husband's ire. Fastred's father, Jofthor, on the other hand, will make it clear that he does not want his daughter to leave town. He believes she is merely infatuated with Bassianus and will soon change her mind, just as she did with her previous interest, Klimmek. If you encourage Bassianus, he and Fastred will move to Riften. At this point, you can choose to talk to Bassianus, informing him of Boti's silent approval, or Klimmek, suggesting to him that he be more bold in regard to Fastred. The man you speak with will then proceed to meet with Fastred; they'll have a brief conversation which you must observe to advance the quest and ensure Mara's work is done. When the quest is completed, Bassianus will leave for Riften regardless of having favored him or not, though he will take Fastred with him if you favored him. In either case, return to Dinya Balu at the Temple of Mara to inform her of your success.  Embers in Stone: Calcelmo and Faleen[edit] Yngvar the Singer's poetry can melt hearts. While Dinya is pleased with your work in Ivarstead, there is more to do. Dinya next will send you to Markarth to speak to Calcelmo. Calcelmo is a great Scholar of Markarth, Dwemer researcher, and powerful conjurer. But for all of his worldliness and knowledge is simply undone by Faleen, a Redguard warrior and housecarl. Speaking directly to Faleen about Calcelmo reveals that she doesn't really have much of an opinion about the scholar. To confound the issue, Calcelmo is afraid of speaking to Faleen. He doesn't know what to talk about and worries that he'll make a bad impression by raising the wrong topic. Clearly, some type of intervention is needed. Calcelmo asks you to find out more about Faleen from her friend, Yngvar the Singer, who is quite the lady's man himself. He can usually be found inside the Silver-Blood Inn during the day or in the Treasury House at night. You can tell Yngvar that Calcelmo is interested in Faleen, or choose to keep Calcelmo's identity a secret. In either case, Yngvar will be happy for his friend and eager to help, for a price. He will offer a romantic poem, ostensibly written by Calcelmo for Faleen, for two hundred gold. When you have completed the transaction, deliver the poem to Faleen. She will be touched and write Calcelmo an encouraging letter in response. Calcelmo and Faleen confessing their love to each other. Give the letter to Calcelmo and he will run off to meet her. Follow him to see them express their mutual affection in person, and the quest will complete. Note: If you complete this quest after the Stormcloaks have claimed Markarth, Faleen will have been relocated to Solitude. This will cause Calcelmo to run all the way from Markarth to Solitude to speak to her. If that happens, fast-travel to the Blue Palace to witness their conversation and complete the quest.  Withstanding Storms: Ruki and Fenrig[edit] Ruki waiting at Gjukar's Monument. When you return, Dinya Balu will congratulate you on helping both young and seasoned love find its way. However, she has a final challenge for you; to reach beyond death to reunite a couple torn apart by war. For this Dinya will give you an Amulet of Mara, which you will need to have equipped in order to see the couple. You will need to travel to Gjukar's Monument, a stone monument commemorating an ancient battle southeast of Rorikstead. Here, the ghost of a woman named Ruki is futilely searching the remnants of a battle that only she can see. She thinks that she is still alive and is looking for her love, Fenrig. She had word that the battle did not go well, but she has been unable to find his body. Ruki and Fenrig ascending into the sky. Fenrig turns out to be quite far from Gjukar's Monument; he can found a short distance directly northwest of Fort Greymoor, and south of the small body of water at the head of the river on the world map. Similar to his wife, he believes he is still alive and camping with the rest of Gjukar's army on the eve of the battle. His dialogue hints that he was killed in an enemy raid of the camp the night before the battle. When you give him word that Ruki has come looking for him, he will agree to follow you. Bring him back to Ruki and they will be confused, but happy to be reunited as they ascend into the sky and eventually disappear.  A Higher Comprehension[edit] Return to Dinya Balu where she will bestow Mara's blessing upon you as well as the resist magic active effect, Agent of Mara. You may also keep the Amulet of Mara given to you, to aid you in finding a spouse."

Return to Astrid.","Let the Festivities Begin[edit] Vittoria and Asgeir at the wedding After the Silence Has Been Broken quest, the first part of the Dark Brotherhood's biggest contract is set in motion. At Astrid's behest, travel to the courtyard of the Temple of the Divines in Solitude. Here you will find the small wedding reception you were directed to attend. Your target is the bride, Vittoria Vici. If you approach Vittoria before she addresses the reception, she will exclaim: ""What an amazing day this has been. I hope you're enjoying the festivities. I'm... I'm just so overwhelmed. Such kindness... for me.""  You can choose one of three dialogue options in response: ""The Stormcloaks say hello!"" ""Oh! Well, you tell your Stormcloak friends ""hello"" right back at them! This is a day of healing! Legion, Stormcloaks - all are welcome here!"" ""Hail the Imperial Legion!"" ""Ha ha ha ha! Yes, yes indeed! Hail the Imperial Legion! Hail the Stormcloaks! Hail Solitude and the Eight Divines!	On this glorious day, we honor everyone! Ha ha ha ha!"" (Remain silent) ""Oh, no need to be shy! My day is your day! Please - eat, drink, make merry! We're all friends here!"" During the reception, she will also tell the guests: ""Please, enjoy the festivities! This is a day of peace and happiness, when Imperials and Stormcloaks join together, as equals!"" or ""Please, enjoy yourself!"" She will then stand up with her fiancé, Asgeir Snow-Shod, and enter a door to reach the balcony, where she will begin addressing her guests. Assassinate her while she speaks to earn the bonus reward. There are several ways you can choose to accomplish the goal (see this section for more details). Strategies[edit] A loose gargoyle hanging over the balcony A sniping spot opposite the balcony There are many strategies you can use to kill Vittoria at her wedding. If you chose to speak to some of your fellow family members, they will give you advice on ways to kill her and what may happen afterwards: If you speak to Babette, she will tell you about a loose gargoyle statue above the balcony: ""It's no fair. I love weddings. Astrid should have given this contract to me. Instead, she's got me visiting cities, assessing security. How boring. But listen, I think I can help you. The wedding reception is outside the Temple of the Divines, right? In Solitude? If so, the bride will probably address the crowd from the balcony. It overlooks the courtyard. Well, there's an old statue there. I've seen it. Hanging right over where she'll be standing. Old means weak. Weak means it could fall. Hmmm?"" If you travel to the wall above the balcony, you can push a loose gargoyle statue when Vittoria makes her address to the wedding guests. To access this balcony, enter the Temple of the Divines, then go up the stairs to the right and through the door at the end of the corridor. You can also access this balcony by going up the stairs located to the right of Castle Dour. The gargoyle is there whether you talk to Babette or not. If you speak to Gabriella, she will tell you: ""I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of surveying the site of the reception. There's a small parapet, just opposite the balcony, that would prove an excellent spot for a long-range kill. I left something there for you. If you're inclined to take that approach."" If you take the door to the northwest of the temple entrance, you will end up on a ledge located opposite the balcony where Vittoria addresses the reception. On the ledge are six arrows, an Elixir of True Shot, and the unique magical bow Firiniel's End. You can simply shoot the bride from this spot; she is easily killed with a single sneak attack from the magic bow you are given. It is best to use these free items now to be sure she is killed immediately. This is especially important if you have a low Archery skill and are planning a ranged attack. Like the gargoyle, the bow is there even if you haven't talked to Gabriella. Nazir will warn you about the possible outcome of murdering Vittoria: ""Slaughtering the Emperor's cousin? At her wedding? Those guards will be out for blood. Wouldn't surprise me if the crowd jumped in too."" Veezara will advise you to plan your escape route beforehand: ""Your contract sounds simple, which means it certainly will not be. Getting into that reception will be easy, but have you thought about getting out?"" Other strategies for killing Vittoria include the following: Pickpocket a Frenzy poison into the groom's inventory as Vittoria addresses the crowd. He will immediately drink it, turn, and kill her, provided that the poison is of sufficient strength. Casting a spell of Frenzy will achieve the same effect, though the Quiet Casting perk may be needed to avoid detection. To kill with a particular poison, you will need a poison of better than Weak strength and the Poisoned perk. Turn into a werewolf or a vampire lordDG (without being seen and therefore incurring no bounty), and then use the door to the overhead balcony where she is located and kill her. A good spot to transform while Vittoria is speaking is the small nook behind the loose gargoyle. By crouching (sneaking) inside this nook, you can avoid incurring a bounty for transforming, and you can swiftly jump down on the bride before the crowd notices what's happening. Follow the happy couple to the balcony where the bride gives her speech. If you crouch down behind the couple you will not be seen by them or the guests. You can kill the bride and, by killing the groom as your last witness, you will get rid of the bounty as both are joined in death. Drop onto the balcony, crouch, and use Unrelenting Force. Purchase an invisibility potion and use it when killing Vittoria, guards shouldn't know that you did it. 'Til Death Do Us Part[edit] Veezara coming to your aid Once Vittoria is killed, pandemonium will break loose. Veezara will then appear, sent by Astrid to offer a distraction while you escape. Even if you weren't detected and got away with the assassination undiscovered, Veezara will still charge in and initiate combat with everyone, drawing attention away from you so you can simply walk out. Sometimes, the guests will still give chase, in which case you can escape the city quickly by using a stairwell under the Castle Dour tower bridge, near the market. One way of avoiding a bounty is to fast travel to the Sanctuary to collect your reward as soon as Vittoria is killed and before the guests turn hostile. Summoning a Legend of the Brotherhood[edit] Upon your arrival back to the Sanctuary, Astrid will congratulate you on your success: ""With Vici's murder, you've started us down a path the Dark Brotherhood hasn't traveled in centuries. The assassination of an Emperor. And now, your reward. A unique spell to summon a legend of the Dark Brotherhood. His soul serves us now in death, as his body once did in life"". This spell will allow you to summon the powerful spirit of an assassin to fight by your side. If you fulfilled the bonus requirements, she will also say ""Ah, and of course, a bonus, for killing Vici while she addressed her guests, as instructed. Gold... simple and pure. Spend it as you will."", and give you a leveled amount of gold. Astrid will then carry on: ""Now then. Time to proceed to the next stage of the plan. Go and speak with Gabriella. She's been helping me arrange your next contract."" When you approach her again, she will tell you: ""As I said, go speak with Gabriella. She's been assisting me with your next contract. This Emperor business, well... it does involve everyone."" The next quest, Breaching Security, will now begin. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked at the end of this quest: Bound Until Death (10 points/Bronze)"

Kill Gaius Maro and plant the incriminating letter. For a bonus, kill him in a major city.","Sins of the Father[edit] When you return from your fateful visit to Vittoria Vici's wedding, you will find a gleeful Astrid ready to move onto the next phase of the plan. She instructs you to visit with Gabriella for the next mission. Gabriella informs you that with the Emperor traveling to Skyrim, the Penitus Oculatus will be securing the way. In order to disrupt the security surrounding the Emperor, you will need to cripple its head, Commander Maro. The Brotherhood's plan to accomplish this is to kill Gaius Maro, the commander's son, and plant a letter implicating him in a plot against the Emperor. Dragon Bridge[edit] Gabriella has instructions on how to locate Gaius Maro, as well as how to earn a special bonus for this contract. To begin, travel to the town of Dragon Bridge and, if you choose, steal Gaius' travel schedule. This makes things much easier, and you really have no reason not to do it. Additionally, killing Gaius in any city other than Dragon Bridge will grant you the ""reading of your future"", according to Gabriella, but this is optional. To obtain the schedule, simply sneak into the building where the schedule is located and nab it. Even if you are detected, with weapons sheathed and without casualties, a soldier will only yell, ""Hey, you won't get away with that!"", one bounty is incurred and they do follow you. (To avoid a bounty, wait until the door shows as being unlocked to go inside. Then, once inside, look to see how many guards are inside. Usually there is only one awake and walking around. Wait for him to go outside and you can now take Gaius Maro's Schedule with no bounty, because the other guard(s) are asleep. Just to be safe, you can always sneak to take it.) Once outside, check what day of the week it is in-game, then read the schedule and travel to the appropriate city. This is the schedule as it appears in game that you steal from the Penitus Oculatus Outpost: Day  Location  Notes   Morndas  Solitude, the Emperor's Tower  -   Morndas evening  Solitude, Castle Dour  Food and sleep.   Tirdas  Windhelm, the Palace of the Kings  -   Tirdas evening  Windhelm, Barracks  Food and sleep.   Middas  Riften, Mistveil Keep  -   Turdas  Whiterun, Dragonsreach  -   Turdas evening  Whiterun, the Bannered Mare  Food and sleep.   Fredas  Markarth, Understone Keep  -   Fredas evening  Markarth, Guard Tower  Food and sleep.   Loredas  -  To be spent at your discretion.   Sundas  -  To be spent at your discretion. The Stalker[edit] Don't be afraid to simply wait for a day and follow Gaius around. There is no time limit on this quest, and when Gaius has completed his schedule, he will repeat the same schedule next week. It is much easier to assassinate him on the road when he is alone, but you forfeit your bonus reward by doing so. Wherever you kill him, loot his corpse and plant the incriminating letter on his body, then return to the Sanctuary. Alternatively, you can reverse-pickpocket the note prior to killing him. Some strategies for completing the contract are to wait until he stays at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. He will go to sleep in a room alone around midnight, allowing for an easy sneak attack. He might also be alone while he's eating in the Windhelm barracks. Conversely, his notes suggest that he doesn't actually sleep in any of the inns or the barracks in Riften, and seems to spend most of his time in the main hall with plenty of watchful eyes, so it might be wiser not to bother him there.  As with all the other targets from Nazir, you can alternatively speak to Gaius and provoke him into attacking you; this allows you to kill him in self-defense without a crime being registered."

Guide Meridia's Light through the temple. Destroy Malkoran. Retrieve Dawnbreaker.","The Beacon of Light[edit] The Lady of Infinite Energies, Meridia, is a Daedric Prince associated with the energies of living things. She is known for her hatred towards the undead of any kind. While the shrines for most other Daedric Princes in Skyrim have been hidden away in remote areas, Meridia has been given an accessible and fully intact shrine with a temple underneath. Recently, a foul darkness desecrated the temple and as such, Meridia is looking for a new champion. There are two ways to begin the journey towards becoming her champion: either find Meridia's Beacon or find the shrine. Meridia's BeaconFind the BeaconThe Beacon can spawn randomly in any boss chest in the game—including those added by Dawnguard and Dragonborn—amounting to over one hundred fifty possible locations. If you happen to find this beacon, as soon as you put it in your inventory you will hear Meridia's voice say, ""A new hand touches the Beacon. Listen. Hear me and obey. A foul darkness has seeped into my temple. A darkness that you will destroy."" Meridia's voice will then go on to give the location of her statue.    DarknessFind the StatueThe Statue is located on Mount Kilkreath (map). As you ascend the steps to the Shrine, Meridia's voice will ring out saying, ""A new supplicant approaches. Listen. Hear me and obey. A foul darkness has seeped into my temple. A darkness that you will destroy. But first, you must restore to me my beacon. I shall guide you unto it. Find it and return here. And great shall be your reward."" This will add a marker to your map showing the randomized location of the beacon. Meet Meridia[edit] Meeting Meridia When you arrive at the shrine with the beacon in hand, the otherworldly voice will echo through the woods once again, saying, ""Look at my temple, lying in ruins. So much for the constancy of mortals, their crafts and their hearts. If they love me not, how can my love reach them? Restore to me my beacon, that I might guide you toward your destiny."" Place the beacon in the gem pedestal as instructed and a giant ray of light will shoot towards the sky, transporting you high above Skyrim. Meridia will then show herself in her true form—a blinding ball of light—and will speak to you: ""It is time for my splendor to return to Skyrim. But the token of my truth lies buried in the ruins of my once great temple, now tainted by a profane darkness skittering within. The Necromancer Malkoran defiles my shrine with vile corruptions, trapping lost souls left in the wake of this war to do his bidding. Worse still, he uses the power stored within my own token to fuel his foul deeds. I have brought you here, mortal, to be my champion. You will enter my temple, retrieve my artifact, and destroy the defiler. Guide my light through the temple to open the inner sanctum and destroy the defiler."" At this point it is possible to ask about the artifact, but in any case Meridia will send you towards the ground with the words: ""Malkoran has forced the doors shut. But this is my temple, and it responds to my decree. I will send down a ray of light. Guide this light through my temple and its doors will open."" The unlocked entrance to the temple can be found lower down on the base of the rock pillar that the statue of Meridia stands upon.  The door is on the side opposite from the additional globes of light outside the locked doors and the chest located to the west. Ray of Light[edit] Follow the Light Light Combined Once inside the Kilkreath Temple, the profane darkness is palpable everywhere -- a thick, black fog oozes through the corridors, and two burned desecrated corpses welcome you.  As you proceed through the first corridor, you'll find another desecrated corpse in an alcove along the left wall, accompanied by several burial urns.  Shortly after, there will be a locked door on your left, behind which is a handle that opens the adjacent gate, giving access to a chest and some minor loot on the other side.  Take the eastern path and face the first huge chamber. Meridia's ray of light will shine down through the ceiling onto a pedestal. Activate the pedestal and the beam of light will be directed onto a device placed above the eastern tunnel.  Note, there are two lootable desecrated corpses in the southeast corner of this room, past the pedestal, and a patch of white cap mushroom is growing along the right-hand wall in the corridor leading to the next room. When you follow the light, however, enemies will start to emerge. Dark shadows called corrupted shades will attack in hordes, trying to prevent you from bringing light to the temple. Dispose of them and enter the next chamber, then activate the pedestal to direct Meridia's light further into the depths of the ruin.  A common soul gem and a candlestick can be located on the table and bookshelf on the left, just past the pedestal.  There is also a lootable urn near the eastern passage.  The eastern path is blocked, however, so locate the narrow tunnel to the south, and dispose of even more corrupted shades.  There are two lootable urns along the left-hand wall.  Open the wooden door, and follow the tunnel until you see a chest.  There will be a desecrated corpse in the large bowl to the right of the entry door.  On the left are two lootable urns and a healing potion on a low shelf.  Now, take a left and enter yet another huge chamber with multiple paths and levels, with more corrupted shades to dispatch.  In the middle of the lower level, a desecrated corpse is slumped against the table.  The beam of light and the pedestal for this room are located above, so head up the set of stairs along the eastern wall.  At the top, as you continue along, you'll find an arcane enchanter straight ahead and another lootable urn to your right.  Immediately nearby, there is also an expert-locked door, behind which is a lever to open the alcove grate to its left, containing a chest.  Cross the nearby stone bridge to find the pedestal.  Upon activating it, the light will open a previously locked door to the south that has lootable urns to each side.  You can either jump across the small gap or use the southern staircase to reach it.  In this newly accessible corridor, there are two burial urns in a left-side alcove, an urn behind a rock pile on the right, a desecrated corpse straight ahead, and another door.  Simply continue through the door to get a breath of fresh air on Kilkreath Balcony. Dawn is Breaking[edit] A Look Outside Once outside, you will notice your efforts have made six pillars light up, but there is still work to do. Make your way across the balcony, and you'll find a staircase leading up, with an expert-locked chest to its right.  Go through the door at the top of the staircase to re-enter Kilkreath Ruins. At the top of the stairs here, there will be a lootable urn to your left.  On the right, you'll find the entrance to a huge chamber with multiple levels and more corrupted shades. Kill the opponents and start your investigation by heading left into the chamber. The ground level has a few urns, and in the southwest corner, there is an altar with another desecrated corpse.  On a table to its right, there is a lootable burial urn, a ring on top of a plate, and some loose gold.  At the southern end of the chamber, note the locked door (key required).  Head back to the stairs near the chamber's entrance, along the eastern wall. At the top of the stairs, on the right, is yet another door that needs a key, so go ahead and activate the first pedestal.  This will open the eastern door behind you, and there are a couple potions on the shelves to its left.  In the first room down the corridor, there is a corrupted shade, scattered lootable urns, and a chest with some minor loot.  Hidden in the shadows on the right is a spear-trapped door. A desecrated corpse lies in the doorway, and the room contains an urn, some potions, assorted minor loot, and a chest of minor loot. The main passage will lead the way to a lever (beware of the tripwire with swinging blades on your way). Pull the lever and go south over the bridge. Follow it until you reach an intersection, then take a right turn.  This leads you to an alcove in the northwest corner, where you'll find a corrupted shade, a desecrated corpse, and a chest.  On the nearby shelves, there are also some potions and other assorted loot, including the Block skill book Battle of Red Mountain. Backtrack to the intersection and make a running jump to the pedestal. Activate it, see the light shine towards a platform above, then jump back to the intersection. Make a running jump towards the now open western door (with an urn to its right), and follow the tunnel to battle even more corrupted shades. You are now in a room with stairs leading up on both sides, and there are several urns and desecrated corpses scattered around the room.  The western staircase leads to a potion on a weight sensitive plate, the eastern one leads to a tunnel containing a few burial urns. Follow the eastern tunnel, and you will reach a lighting pedestal, with a desecrated corpse slumped at its base. Activate this light, and it opens a final door at the southern end of the ground floor of the chamber, which will lead you to Kilkreath Catacombs. A New Day is Dawning[edit] Malkoran is waiting Once in the catacombs, in a room at the end of the initial corridor, you'll find the final pedestal on a raised dais.  Make your way to the pedestal and activate it. This will turn on the final beam of light, open the nearby door, and awaken Malkoran, the necromancer responsible for Meridia's wrath.  You'll want to loot this room before leaving, as there will be no turning back once you enter the next chamber.  At the base of the dais, you'll find a desecrated corpse, along with some loose gold.  Along the right wall is another desecrated corpse, and in the northeast corner, there's a healing potion.  In the southeast corner of the room, just beyond the dais, you'll find a chest, a magicka potion, and some burial urns, along with another desecrated corpse.  Upon leaving the pedestal room, your journal will update when you reach the final chamber, and it is now your objective to kill Malkoran.  He is protected by six corrupted shades and is a strong opponent who uses frost spells from a distance, so use the columns to your advantage. When Malkoran is dead, be aware you will also have to face his shade.  When all is said and done, Meridia will speak: ""It is done. The defiler is defeated. Take Dawnbreaker from its pedestal.""  Be sure you loot the room before you retrieve the sword, as you will be transported outside as soon as you take it.  In addition to the many urns and desecrated corpses scattered throughout the chamber, there is a healing potion to the left of the entryway.  On a table along the left-hand wall, there is a poison bottle hidden in a bowl, and there is a second poison bottle tucked under a broken table on the right-hand side of the room.  When you finally retrieve Meridia's powerful sword, everything will turn into light, and you will find yourself high above Skyrim once again, facing Meridia: ""Malkoran is vanquished. Skyrim's dead shall remain at rest. This is as it should be. This is because of you. A new day is dawning. And you shall be its herald. Take the mighty Dawnbreaker and with it purge corruption from the dark corners of the world. Wield it in my name, that my influence may grow."" Should you choose to obey her wish, you will get the polite final words from Meridia: ""May the light of certitude guide your efforts.""  Should you respond that you won't spread her message, Meridia will tell you: ""It matters not.  The plant cares nothing for the rays that bring it the warmth of the sun.  As you carry Dawnbreaker, so will my light touch the world."""

Alarmingly, Brelyna will exclaim, ""Oh dear. That wasn't supposed to happen."" Then she will ask, ""Do you... do you feel all right? You look very, umm, green."" She will apologize profusely, assuring you that the green effect is temporary. It will fade after a few in-game hours. Altered States[edit] After the effects of the first attempt fade, and if you are being a good sport about it all, return to Brelyna and she will ask you to help her again.

Lastly, he will point you towards Skyrim and The Reach to find a specimen in a Forsworn hideout. Before you leave, he will cast Neloth's Memory Spell so you can remember what you observe.

By a Girl, no Less![edit] Others will take notice of the boy's distress, and try to speak to Lars, who will be unforthcoming, including Bergritte, who suggests her grandson go play outside: Bergritte: ""Lars, dear, why don't you go outside and play? It's a beautiful day."" Lars: ""That's all right, grandmother. I like staying home with you."" Bergritte: ""It's that Braith girl again, isn't it? Has she been bothering you again?

Lars' no-nonsense mother, Alfhild Battle-Born, will take a much harder tone, saying: ""My boy Lars has been getting beat senseless, and by a girl, no less!""

I.... I've come to tell you that I'm not afraid of you anymore.""  (none)  (none)   Braith  ""Don't make me laugh, baby Battle-Born. You'll be afraid of me till the day I kill you.""  ""Battle-Born!

Braith  ""Oh no? So you're gonna fight back if I punch you? Huh? You're gonna hit a girl?""  ""You'd better give me five septims, right now, or I'm going to bloody your nose...""  ""What are you gonna do if I don't? Huh? Gonna cry to your papa?""   Lars  ""Well, no... I... I mean...""  ""No! Please! I really don't have any money, Braith! I'll give you ten septims tomorrow.

Or I'm gonna bloody your nose and your lip.""  (none)  A Love/Hate Relationship[edit] At Lars' request, you can approach Braith and tell her to stop her bullying ways. In order to persuade her, you can tell her: ""I'm Lars' bodyguard. Mess with him and you mess with me!"" ""He has a disease. It's very contagious."" ""You want to be shipped off to the Honorhall Orphanage?"" As harsh as the last choice may seem, all three options lead to the same response. It turns out Braith has liked Lars for quite some time now, and only wanted a kiss. If he had obliged, she wouldn't have had to bully him. Although this may seem like an odd way to treat the boy she wants a kiss from, the blame for this warped behavior does not entirely lie with Braith herself, as she can often be heard asking her parents for advice, to little or no avail: Braith: ""Papa, I want to talk to you..."" Amren: ""Hmm? What about?"" Braith: ""Well, there's this boy, and..."" Amren: ""Listen, Braith... Why don't you talk to your mother about this, okay? There's a good girl.""

Braith: ""I wanted to ask you something. It's about a boy..."" Saffir: ""Not now, Braith. Go... go ask your father."" After the quest conclusion, you'll notice that Braith no longer bullies Lars, and in fact keeps her distance from him. Lars will thank you for your help, and Braith will tell you that she has stopped bullying him."

Once you have caught the required fish, return to Swims where you can either return his hat to him or lie that you didn't find it: Here are the fish you were after. I also found your lucky fishing hat. ""You are like my brood to me. Here. A token."" Here's the fish for the challenge. I couldn't find your lucky fishing hat. (Lie) ""It can't be helped. Thank you. Here this is for you."" Either option leads to you getting an Argonian fishing rod and the ability to create more, if you give Swims his hat back, he will also reward you with 400 gold: Thanks for the Argonian fishing rod, and the coin. I'll put them to good use. An Argonian fishing rod? Thank you. I will be sure to put it to good use. ""My thanks to you."""

Return to Svana.","A Worshipper[edit] If you visit Haelga's Bunkhouse in Riften, you may see Svana Far-Shield busy doing some cleaning there. The work is difficult and endless, and she prefers to call it slavery. Ever since her parents died and Haelga took her in, it's been a nightmare. She was surprised to learn that Haelga is such a wretched woman. ""So now I'm stuck living here while those pigs she calls customers grope me and say the most awful things."" In her opinion, Haelga is disgusting and she takes her worship of Dibella a bit too seriously. According to Svana, Haelga slept with three different men in the last month. Svana would like to see her squirm just once. She happens to know that after Haelga makes love, she gives her partner a token of her affection called a Mark of Dibella. If you collect the marks from Bolli, Indaryn, and Hofgrir (All three men are located in Riften), and confront Haelga with them, it would cause her endless embarrassment. Furthermore, Svana asks that you collect the marks without violence. Three Lovers[edit] In order to get the three Marks of Dibella, you can use your Speech skills to persuade or intimidate the men into giving their marks to you. Alternatively, you can just pickpocket the marks from your targets. If you kill any of the men, the quest will fail immediately. Bolli can usually be found wandering in the market or working in Riften Fishery. Talk to him about the mark and he will say ""I have no idea what you're talking about. I'd never sleep with anyone besides my good wife, Drifa [sic]."" You must pass an average-level Speech check to persuade him. Option  Dialogue  Reaction   Hand it over and no one has to know.

Nothing Indaryn can usually be found at the Black-Briar Meadery, but he will visit The Bee and Barb too. If you talk to him about Haelga, he will be a little angry ""You're crazy! How dare you make such an accusation!"" You must pass an average-level Speech check to persuade him. Option  Dialogue  Reaction   Hand it over and no one has to know. (Persuade) Passed: If word gets around that I bedded her, they'll lose all respect for me at the meadery. Take the mark if you want it. It's not worth all this hassle anyway.Failed: You aren't making any sense. Hand what over? Passed: Get the Mark of DibellaFailed: Nothing   Give it to me or else!

It's not worth all this hassle anyway.Failed: You're threatening me? Oh, that's rich! Passed: Get the Mark of DibellaFailed: Nothing   Never mind. My mistake. You've got some nerve. Nothing Hofgrir is the owner of the Riften Stables and you can find him there easily. If you ask him to give you the mark, he will pretend to be innocent: ""Huh? What are you talking about? I don't even know what that is.""  You must pass an easy-level Speech check to persuade him. (See Bugs). Option  Dialogue  Reaction   Hand it over and no one has to know. (Persuade) Passed: I don't want a bad reputation in Riften, but Haelga's out of control. She wanted to try it in the stables so I said yes.

Next time think before you speak. Nothing Two Rewards[edit] Once you have all three Marks of Dibella, return to Haelga's Bunkhouse and show them to Haelga. She will be surprised. ""What? How... where did you get these?"" Obviously, she doesn't want anyone else to know about it, especially Svana. She will give you a magic scroll to keep you quiet. ""If word got out that I'm practicing my Dibellan Arts in Riften, they'll run me out of town."" Bring the news to Svana, and she will be quite happy. ""Oh I know. Isn't it wonderful? I bet she squirmed like a skeever when you pulled them out of your pocket."" She believes things are going to be a lot different around here with your help. Then she will give you a piece of enchanted armor in return. ""I want you to have this. It was my father's but I'm certain you'll put it to good use."""

(Optional) Wear a set of Mythic Dawn robes. Defeat Vonos.","Ambush at the shrine The Mythic Dawn camp This quest will start once you reach level 46. A courier delivers the Stranger's Plea to you to read. It is a request to meet from Skorvild, an ex-Mythic Dawn cultist who turned away from the cult and needs help stopping their next nefarious plan. Travel to The Two Pillars, which is near the center of Whiterun Hold's tundra, south of Swindler's Den and northeast of Broken Fang Cave. It is close to and within sight of the Shrine of Zenithar to the west. Sadly for Skorvild, his former cult-mates will catch up with him before he can speak with you. Once you arrive at the shrine you will spot the body of Skorvild, and two Mythic Dawn assassins will attack you. Once you have killed the assassins, loot their bodies for the Mythic Dawn Orders, and then search Skorvild for his journal. You will then need to head to the Mythic Dawn Camp to investigate. The camp itself is found north of the Alchemist's Shack. The camp has three hostile Mythic Dawn explorers, Once they are dispatched you can pick up the Excavation Leader's Journal. The journal explains that the Mythic Dawn are attempting to reopen an Oblivion gate, and have been excavating across the valley to the south in the Jerall Mountains for a powerful artifact that will help them do it.  Varlais Cavern and Rielle[edit] Vanus and the other dead Mythic Dawn Travel to Varlais Cavern, which can be found south of Arcwind Point. As you enter the cavern, you will find an excavation site inside that has cracked open an entrance to the Ayleid ruins of Rielle. There are Ayleid casks and urns that can be looted throughout the chambers. As you get deeper into the ruin, you will enter a large room with the corpses of cultists and the corpse of Janus, there are wights patrolling so be prepared for a fight. After reading the journal, you will need to locate the elemental stones: Elemental Shard - Wel - Found on the corpse of a Mythic Dawn Explorer. Elemental Shard - Sercen - Carried by a Wight Lord. Elemental Shard - Nen - Carried by a Wight Lord just before the door to Rielle Crypt. Elemental Shard - Alata - Carried by a Wight Lord in Rielle Crypt.  The shard holders Once you have found all the shards, you will need to head deeper into the ruins to find the shard holders, take care to avoid the traps. When it comes to placing the elemental shards in the holders you need to place them in specific holders: Wel goes in the North holder Sercen goes in the South holder Nen goes in the West holder Alata goes in the East holder Once you have placed the shards, a secret door will open and reveal a large room with a Great Welkynd Stone. Take the stone and Norion the Undying, an Ayleid Lich with as much power as a Dragon Priest, will burst out of his coffin. Beware his minions, including two Wight archers who sleep in the coffins upstairs on either side of the room. Once Norion is killed you can search his body for the Staff of Ehlno Ede and the Rielle key. You will be directed to defeat Norion once you take the Great Welkynd Stone even if you have already noticed Norion and woke him with a rune spell to defeat him early. Go back to the room where you placed the four stones. At the south part of that room there is a small dead-end room where you can find a switch that opend the way out. Head back into the main area of Rielle, where you will see Vigilants of Stendarr (including Vigil Enforcers if the Vigil Enforcer Armor Set Creation has been installed) fighting with Mythic Dawn agents. You can aid the Vigilants against the Mythic Dawn. Once you get back to the entrance of Rielle, there is a corpse of a Vigil Enforcer that has a journal, read the journal and you will find out that the location of the Oblivion gate is in Red Scar Cavern.  Note: If you choose to wear Mythic Dawn Robes while exiting Rielle, the Vigilants outside will mistake you for a Mythic Dawn member and attack. If you do not wear the robes, they will let you pass.  Red Scar Cavern[edit] Vonos There is a Mythic Dawn Guard outside of the cavern that can be tricked if you wear a set of Mythic Dawn robes, if you wish to avoid fighting. This will also work on the cultists inside. Continue through the cavern and you will eventually reach a door to the Mythic Dawn Temple. Once inside the temple, you will see an inactive Oblivion gate, you will then have to kill Vonos. Once you kill him however, the Oblivion gate will open, the quest will finish and The Consequences will begin."

Speak to Brynjolf.","When you come across a merchant named Brynjolf at the Riften bazaar during the day or in The Bee and Barb at night, he will propose that you frame a vendor by planting a stolen ring on his person. The intended victim, Brand-Shei, has apparently become aware that someone is doing something wrong, and that someone wants him in jail where he can't interfere. If you accept, Brynjolf will tell you that he will create a distraction in the bazaar. While this draws people's attention, you are to steal a ring from Madesi. Madesi keeps the ring in a strongbox inside the cabinet under the counter of his stall, both of which are locked. You can unlock the cabinet and strongbox at night for an easier theft, or simply pickpocket Madesi's key off of him. Then, wait until after 4pm to actually steal the ring. Note that the ring you must steal will specifically say ""Madesi's Silver Ring,"" rather than just any silver ring. After stealing the ring, sneak up to Brand-Shei and position yourself behind the crates he is sitting on. Pickpocket him and place the ring in his inventory. If you wish to spare Brand-Shei, you can drop the ring instead and tell Brynjolf you lost it. He won't be very happy, but you will be able to proceed to the next quest nonetheless. This quest can also be completed without stealing and pickpocketing by simply waiting while Brynjolf distracts the crowd. If you do attempt the theft and are caught by a wandering guard, you will be arrested. In either case, you will still be able to progress to the next quest. Speak to Brynjolf to receive a reward of 100 septims and a chance to join the Thieves Guild."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Chasing_Echoes","Speak to Serana. Explore Castle Volkihar. Investigate the Moondial. Explore Castle Volkihar's Ruined Tower. Locate Valerica's Journal. (If not a vampire) Become a Vampire Lord or get partially soul trapped. Enter the Soul Cairn.","Half    Full    Cres  Locations of the missing crests on a map of Castle Volkihar Courtyard Serana will speak to you after the Moth Priest reads the Elder Scroll, saying she may know where to find one of the scrolls. She thinks her mother, Valerica, may have information on it, and may even possess it. Serana believes Valerica may have left a clue in the courtyard at Castle Volkihar. Though you will not be able to enter through the Keep, Serana knows of a secret entrance you can use. If you have a follower at this point, you must dismiss them. Simply telling them to wait is not enough: Serana won't accompany you unless you send your follower home. When you reach the castle, head northwest, along the coastline. When you reach the castle's old docks, you will be attacked by four high-powered skeletons. Use the secret entrance to the undercroft and fight your way through death hounds, skeevers, skeletons, and a feral vampire. After dealing with the vampire, you will arrive at a stone archway with a raised drawbridge. Head up a set of stairs on the opposite corner of the room to find the lever needed to lower the bridge. Cross the bridge and take a left as instructed by Serana: this leads into an open area inhabited by death hounds. Climb the stairs in the southern section and pass through a tunnel leading to a room with a giant frostbite spider. You can snipe at the spider from the tunnel, as it's too large to enter the tunnel. Once you've dispatched it, pull a lever to lower another bridge, giving you access to the courtyard. The courtyard itself is abandoned and derelict, and Serana will immediately tell you there is something wrong with the moon dial. You will need to find the three missing pieces and place them in the moon dial in order for a secret entrance to open. The Half Moon Crest is in the center of a pond lying against a rock in the northwest corner of the courtyard. The Full Moon Crest is behind a patch of nightshade lying against the castle's exterior wall in the fenced off area identified as Valerica's garden. The Crescent Moon Crest is up the stairs, to the right of the entrance to Volkihar North Tower lying on the floor beside a table and chairs. Serana opening the portal to the Soul Cairn Once all pieces are back in place, the dial will swivel to reveal steps leading down to the ruins below the castle. Fight your way past more gargoyles and skeletons until you reach a room with gargoyles and a fireplace. Serana will tell you there must be a secret entrance somewhere, and sure enough, you can either turn the candlestick near the fireplace or pull the chain behind the gargoyle to reveal a secret door. Note that pulling the chain will unleash the stone gargoyle. There is also a vampire royal armor near the shelf to the right. Head through the secret door to Valerica's study. Here you will need to search for her journal, in the central bookcase west of where you entered. After Serana reads it, she will tell you to find certain ingredients in the laboratory: The Finely Ground Bone Meal is on the table by the entrance beneath the mammoth skull. The Soul Gem Shards are on the first wardrobe up the stairs that lead east. The Purified Void Salts are on a shelf with other ingredients, near the farthest point of the raised area of the room, on the balcony above the entrance. All of these items are in silver bowls, and will be added to your miscellaneous inventory when you pick them up, as they are considered quest items. Note that ""regular"" bonemeal, soul gem fragments, and void salts will not work. Once you have all three, place them in the vessel in front of the portal, which Serana is typically standing next to. She will then add her blood to the mixture, opening a portal to the Soul Cairn. If you are vampire (whether by siding with the Volkihar or through ""regular"" infection when siding with the Dawnguard), you will be able to enter straight away. If you are not a vampire, you will suffer some health damage when attempting to use the portal. Serana will explain that to enter the Soul Cairn you must be ""dead"" and then give you a choice: Allow her to turn you into a Vampire Lord. Allow her to trap part of your soul in a soul gem. This is the only way to enter the Soul Cairn without becoming a vampire and will add the Weakened Soul effect, which reduces your health, stamina, and magicka by 45 points (as well as their regeneration rates) while in the Soul Cairn. Choosing either will allow you to enter the Soul Cairn."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Chief_of_Thirsk_Hall","Talk to the Riekling Chief. Lure Bilgemuck back to Thirsk Mead Hall. Bring ten scathecraw to the chief. Kill the Nords. Speak to the chief, and defend yourself.","Thirsk Mead Hall[edit] The legendary Thirsk Mead Hall has a long, violent history and is over 300 years of age, although rumors claim it to be closer to 700. Founded in the Third Era by Hrothmund the Red of the Skaal, the hall was initially built for Nord warriors who wished to live and fight in the wilderness, the old way. Numerous legends of heroic acts surround the hall, but also stories about the chieftains getting killed by their successors. In true Nord tradition, the mead hall was also about downing mead around the clock and telling old tales. In the Fourth Era, the comforts of the mead hall had made the residing warriors too lazy, and, as a result, the hall was an easy target for a group of invading rieklings who overwhelmed the warriors and exiled them to a snowy camp south of their former home. The Riekling Chief[edit] ""You strong. Help tribe-kin."" When you pay Thirsk Mead Hall a visit, you will find rieklings gathered outside the entrance, with one of them actively seeking you out. For reasons unknown, the riekling can speak a little bit, saying: ""You. Fol. Low. Me."" You can ask him a few questions, but it turns out he only knows that one line. Follow him into the mead hall, where the interior reflects the presence of the disorganized rieklings, with chairs turned over, bones scattered around, and several tents put up in the corners. You will be led to the Riekling Chief who sits in his throne, saying: ""You strong. Help tribe-kin."" You can then choose from three different options, although the chief is not exactly well-spoken: Where did you live before you were here? ""Tribe-kin live all places. All of world within great water."" Who are you? ""You. You strong. Help tribe-kin."" Why did you take over Thirsk? ""Hot fire. Cold dizzydrink. Happy tribe."" The middle option is the only one that will get you anywhere, and will provide two more options. Choose the 'what is going on here' option and he will respond: ""We family. We strong, you stronger."" At this point you can back out, or you can suggest that he may be asking for help. The latter will make him explain: ""Bilgemuck run. Prize beast, run. Fool tribe-kin, chase away. Bilgemuck fear. You bring, he follow you. Yes?"" The Chief will then keep you guessing, but it turns out Bilgemuck is a prize beast as he will repeat: ""Bilgemuck prize beast. You find, he follow. Bilgemuck love meat. Give meat, he follow. You go."" Bilgemuck[edit] Bilgemuck As instructed, find yourself a piece of meat and locate Bilgemuck, a named bristleback that hides on the other side of the lake from the hall. When you locate Bilgemuck, he will greet you with a snort but will be peaceful and await your next action. He will accept many types of meat including clam meat, dog meat, leg of goat, pheasant breast, raw rabbit leg, salmon meat, and venison, but excluding boar meat, crab meat, nix-hound meatCC, ash hopper meat, and human flesh. Once he's finished eating, he will readily follow you back to the hall and find his spot in the pen behind the house. Enter the mead hall for yet another encounter with the demanding chief: ""Bilgemuck follow you. Bilgemuck know strength. Tribe-kin stronger. You stay, help more."" Redgrass[edit] For your next task to strengthen the tribe, the chief wants you to gather plants, saying: ""Tribe-kin missing redgrass. Need for godspeak dance. You bring redgrass, we dance."" When you ask him to translate, the chief will show you a sample of scathecraw, the reddish plant growing all over Solstheim: ""Here, like this. Go, bring two hands of redgrass. Be friend of tribe-kin."" After a quick farewell dance he will return to his throne and await your return. Scathecraw is one of the most common plants and it is quite easy to gather ten samples from Raven Rock, where they can be picked from all over the main road, all the way down to the field behind Ienth Farm, which is full of them. You will not receive a quest update so once you have ten, return to the chief who will comment: ""Good redgrass. Later, we burn. Now, final task."" Kill the Nords[edit] For the final task, the Riekling Chief has something very specific in mind, and far more serious than the previous tasks: ""Bad Nords. Say Thirsk theirs. Live by water, bother tribe-kin. We fight. You strong. You help. No more bad Nords."" When asked if he wants you to commit murder, the response will be: ""Bad people. They come, fight us. We fight back now."" NOTE: At this point, it is still possible to abandon the quest and instead help the former inhabitants reclaim Thirsk Mead Hall. Choose the dialogue option ""I'm not sure about this"" and leave the building. Head to Bujold's Retreat and speak to Bujold the Unworthy. Agreeing to help her will fail this quest and instead start Retaking Thirsk. Otherwise, continue the walkthrough below. As soon as you agree to help the Rieklings, the Chief will jump down from his throne and rush out to the front door. When you come outside, the rest of the rieklings will be gathered and ready to fight, and the chief will prepare them for battle: Chief: ""Froo ha cawasy jo la. Karoo taray pelfrik?"" All: ""Hawah!"" Chief: ""Felgir paw tuwani barj. Goora! Goora! Goora!"" All: ""Goora!"" ""Stab and run! The tribe-kin way."" With the soldiers prepped for fight, the chief will lead them in an eastern direction towards the hiding place of the mead hall's former inhabitants, Bujold's Retreat. You can choose to run ahead and take care of the Nords yourself, let the rieklings help you with the battle, or let the rieklings do all the fighting (they will dispatch the Nords). The Tribe-Kin Way[edit] After all of the Nords at the camp are dead, the riekling soldiers will begin to walk back to the mead hall while the chief turns on you, convinced you will take over his spot on the throne and become the new chief: ""You strong! All tribe-kin stronger with you. But... maybe you too strong. Too strong, want be chief."" This leaves you no choice but to fight the hostile chief. If the other rieklings are nearby, they will attack the chief, or if they have returned to the mead hall, you can lead the chief back to them and they will attack him. Note that the rieklings can injure the chief only to the point that he will drop to one knee; it falls to you to deal the killing blow. Ending this quest allows you to have a riekling as a follower. A group of up to three rieklings may now also occasionally show up to aid you during random fights, be it on Solstheim or in Skyrim."

Return to Othreloth.","Elder Othreloth[edit] In the Temple of Raven Rock, the residing priest Elder Othreloth has a huge problem with the Ancestral Tomb underneath the temple. While patrolling around Raven Rock between 1pm and 7pm, Second Councilor Adril Arano may visit the chapel and receive yet another complaint by the troubled priest: ""When are you going to do something about our central Ancestral Tomb?"" Adril: ""You wanted to speak to me, Elder?"" Othreloth: ""I did indeed. When are you going to do something about our central Ancestral Tomb? I can't even go down there any longer. It's getting intolerable!"" Adril: ""I'm sorry, Elder. I'm doing the best I can."" Othreloth: ""I appreciate your problems, Adril, but I can't be expected to run a temple with those... things running around in there."" Adril: ""With all due respect, those ""things"" aren't the only problem we have right now. Be patient, keep the door locked, and we'll get there when we can."" Othreloth: ""Hmph. Very well. I'll just have to find someone else to assist us then."" With the authorities too busy to help him out, Elder Othreloth will have no choice but to lure adventurers like you to help him. When he sees you he will ask: ""Are you here to pray, or perhaps pay your respects at our Ancestral Tomb?"" When you ask him what the tomb is, he will immediately request some assistance and provide some background information in the process: ""They are where we inter our dead. They are sacred places, meant to honor their passing. Sadly, we've been unable to use the Ancestral Tomb beneath the Temple as of late, and have resorted to other locations to scatter the remains."" He will then proceed to explain that ash spawn have taken over the tomb, making it impossible to perform proper burial rituals. Offer to help him out and he will hand you the key to the tomb and wish you the best of luck. Cleanse the Tomb[edit] Head downstairs and unlock the door to the tomb with the key. Once inside, the problem soon manifests itself, as a total of eleven hostile ash spawn will crawl out of the various huge ceremonial urns with the ashes of the ancestors. They will surface one by one at first, then two at a time. While most will be regular ash spawn, two of those that spawn near the end are leveled. Dispose of them all as quickly as possible, because they can easily gang up on you. If necessary, exit the tomb through any of the doors to restore your health; the ash spawn cannot follow you. Lower-level players will find the Become Ethereal shout useful to avoid damage when carrying out hit-and-run attacks. When all is said and done, loot the ash piles as they have a chance of carrying valuable loot, then leave the tomb and return to Othreloth. When presented with the good news, Othreloth will exclaim: ""Spirits be praised! I'm hoping you didn't suffer much at the hands of those foul beings. Please, accept this as a token of my thanks."" He will then hand you a reward, a leveled amount of gold. Reward[edit] Levels Reward   1-29 250   30-39 500   40-49 1000   50-59 1500   60+ 2000"

Use the Bend Will shout to cleanse the Sun Stone. Use the Bend Will shout to cleanse the Water Stone.","With the Wind Stone cleansed, return to Skaal Village and tell Storn Crag-Strider the good news. He will suggest you to do the same for the remaining four stones of Solstheim. He doubts it will fully stop whatever Miraak is doing, but it may slow his progress. Your map will be updated and show you the location of your targets: Beast Stone, Earth Stone, Sun Stone, and Water Stone. Beast Stone[edit] The Beast Stone is southwest of Skaal Village; this is the nearest stone you may find. Two entranced Rieklings are working there. A leveled cultist is patrolling around the stone and monitoring the work of Miraak's poor slaves. The cultist will attack you on sight, so defeat your enemy and use the Bend Will shout to cleanse the stone. The structure around the stone will collapse and a leveled lurker will raise from the water. The two Rieklings won't turn hostile to you. They will stay here for a short moment then return to their tribe at Thirsk Mead Hall. Sun Stone[edit] Keep traveling south and you'll find the Sun Stone in the north of Tel Mithryn. A group of Reavers are focusing on their building. Shout at the stone and a leveled lurker will attack you. The fight will be much easier with the help of these Reavers. They won't attack you after the combat; they'll just wander around the stone and give you some generic, non-hostile responses. After you leave this area, they will be removed from the game. Earth Stone[edit] Travel to Raven Rock and you should find the Earth Stone without much trouble. Bralsa Drel, Rirns Llervu, and three Redoran guards have lost themselves here, doing their work mindlessly. Cleanse the stone and two lurkers will appear this time. One is near the stone, the other one is near the coastline. The guards will try their best to give you a hand. Pay close attention to the safety of Bralsa as she gives a quest later on. They will return to the city soon after regaining their freedom. Water Stone[edit] Walk along the west coast of Solstheim to find the Water Stone. The shrine at this stone is being worked on by a group of sailors, and a cultist is monitoring their work. The cultist will attack you without hesitation. Defeat your enemy and do the same to the stone. A leveled lurker will rise from the water and try to kill you. In addition, a low-level dragon will fly in from the west.

She will then hand you a bounty for a glassfish for Zaria in Falkreath. Once you obtain a glassfish, head to Grave Concoctions in Falkreath to speak to Zaria: Here's the glassfish you requested in your bounty. ""I'm grateful for your efforts. Here, take this."" She will then give you 200 gold and a note from the Jarl. Thanks for the coin. And... a note from the Jarl? ""Maybe you can help me."" The note from the Jarl states that a guard has been stealing skooma from the evidence chest, and that the Jarl would like for the guard to have an invisibility potion poured into an empty skooma bottle to scare the guard straight. Speak to Zaria to obtain the invisibility potion: I'll deliver the disguised potion in exchange for the Jarl's ring. ""Thank you. Here, this is for you."" I'll return when the deed is done. Hopefully he learns his lesson. ""Good luck out there."" She will then hand you a Disguised Invisibility Potion. You will then need to head to the Falkreath Barracks to talk to the guard where you will have two options: Seems like you don't have any trouble keeping the edge off while on duty. ""I beg your pardon, sir. I don't know what you're getting at, but whatever it is, it's not appreciated."" Here, take this. My way of saying thanks. ""I understand. Now let's pledge never to speak of this again."" Here's a bottle of skooma I found laying about. I trust you'll lock it away? ""Of course."" Either option leads to you needing to follow the guard into the jail, you can then overhear him say: ""Soon. I can almost taste it."" He will then drink the potion, turn invisible and then shout: ""Oh, no! By the Gods! This can't be happening! Gods help us!"" As you exit the jail, the guard will become visible again and say: ""I don't feel... right... I'm going to lay down... for awhile..."" Head back to Zaria and speak to her: I don't think that guard will be using skooma any longer. ""Excellent. You've done us a great service. Here is your reward.""

Place supplies in indicated chest. Return to Klimmek for your reward.","Klimmek's Problem[edit] ""I'm just not ready to make the climb to High Hrothgar."" When you arrive in Ivarstead for the first time, you will find Klimmek and Gwilin having a conversation on the bridge: Gwilin: ""On your way up the 7,000 Steps again, Klimmek?"" Klimmek: ""Not today. I'm just not ready to make the climb to High Hrothgar. The path isn't safe."" Gwilin: ""Aren't the Greybeards expecting some supplies?"" Klimmek: ""Honestly, I'm not certain. I've yet to be allowed into the monastery. Perhaps one day."" Apparently Klimmek makes a trip every few weeks up the 7,000 steps to High Hrothgar to deliver supplies to the Greybeards, though he has never actually seen them in person. Unfortunately, he is now older, and finds the climb more difficult. You can choose to help him, with the promise of a reward. He will give you a bag of supplies and ask you to place them in a chest outside the High Hrothgar monastery. Deliver the Goods[edit] If you have already discovered High Hrothgar, you may simply travel there. If not, you must climb the 7,000 steps leading out of Ivarstead and up the mountainside, encountering some wolves along the way. Once at the top of the 7,000 steps, you will see the monastery with a chest located in the center of a pair of stairwells that lead up to the building itself. Now just open the chest and place the supplies inside. Klimmek's supplies are found in the Misc section of the inventory. There and Back Again[edit] Once you have placed the supplies in the chest, return to Klimmek, who will compensate you for your leg work. He will give you a level-dependent amount of gold as a reward.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Coming_of_Age","Note: This quest does not appear in your journal. Meet Salma and Beem-Ja outside Ironbind Barrow and speak with Salma. Escort Salma and Beem-Ja through the ruins until a fight with Warlord Gathrik begins. Kill Beem-Ja and speak with Salma.","The quest begins as soon as you arrive at Ironbind Barrow and witness an argument between Beem-Ja and Salma about venturing into the ruins. Speak with Salma and she will decide there's enough treasure for everyone and enter the ruins. Unfortunately, she and Beem-Ja must not really believe that there's enough to go around, because once inside they incessantly charge headlong into rooms full of leveled draugr. Although they can't actually be killed by any of the mobs in the barrow, you can accidentally kill one or both of them as they may jump in front of you during the fights; frequent game saves are strongly advised in case they are killed. Salma and Beem-Ja will rush ahead and make short work of the spiders in the first passage whether you help or not. When you arrive in a large room with a double staircase leading up to an east-west landing with a locked gate heading north, loot the chest on the east side of the landing before pulling the handle in the alcove on the west end to open the gate. Proceed north down the passage into a circular room with a floor grating, two leveled draugr, a chest on the west wall and some minor loot on and near the table. Salma and Beem-Ja will rush ahead. Take the exit in the northeast corner and follow the hall around and down to the west, where you will see a chest behind a pressure plate that activates a spear trap in the alcove directly ahead. You can loot both the chest and the helm next to it without crossing the pressure plate. Go north from there to find the two friends trying to kill two more leveled draugr at the end of a short eastward-heading bridge. There's some minor loot on the floor and on the table and shelves to the south, plus an adept-locked chest in the southwest corner of the platform beside the wooden partition. Descend the log ramp southward from the end of the bridge and chase Salma and Beem-Ja through the gate and into the next room. Defeat the two draugr there, then collect the few potions around the room and follow your charges out to the east, into a wide passage with a helmet on a pedestal in front of a closed gate. Notice the ominous black holes in the floor around the pedestal, and stand back a bit to loot the helm so that the spear trap doesn't kill you as the gate opens. Alternatively, if you stand at the pedestal, turn around so your back is to it, and look at the ceiling, there is a chain you can pull to open the gate without triggering the trap. Follow the hall to the iron doors and save your game before opening them, for the boss fight against Warlord Gathrik, at least one draugr or skeleton and possibly a frost atronach, is next. Fight Gathrik as you would any Draugr or Dragon Priest. His tactics will vary based on his abilities. Beem-Ja is scripted to start walking away when you open the door to Gathrik's chamber, avoiding the final fight. He will wander around a safe distance until Gathrik is killed, at which point he will run back and reveal his true colors. To prevent this, you can body-block him until the approaching minions trigger his aggression, at which point he will become an asset like Salma. After Gathrik is defeated, a script restores him to full health when he betrays you. As soon as you defeat Gathrik, Beem-Ja thanks you for your help and asks you to hold still while he kills you for a blood sacrifice that he needs to perform in order to help him absorb Gathrik's power. Apparently, he's a necromancer. Killing him as soon as the dialogue releases you is highly recommended. Beem-Ja may reanimate Gathrik's body to fight for him. After Beem-Ja has been defeated, Salma will express her disbelief at his treachery but adds that her father never trusted him to begin with. She says that she now wants to be alone and decides to leave the ruins on her own, explaining that she no longer wants the treasure. Among Beem-Ja's loot is a letter from Salma's father threatening to expose whatever unspecified evil Beem-Ja did back in Black Marsh if he allows any harm to come to Salma. The word wall is behind Gathrik's throne at the north end of the upper level, and a boss-level unlocked chest is just to the west of the word wall. The exit is on the eastern side of the lower level, activated by a pull chain on the wall just to the right of the gate. Climb up the spiral stairway and exit to Ironbind Overlook, then unbar the door in front of you and exit to find an unlocked chest. Be sure to continue past the chest around to the left and up the hill to find an unusual Dwarven monument with three pillars guarded by two Ice Wraiths; see unmarked places for full details."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Compelling_Tribute_(Imperial)","Report to Legate Rikke at the Rift Imperial Camp. Find evidence at Mistveil Keep. Search Anuriel's room until you find the evidence. Confront Anuriel about the evidence. Report back to Rikke. Attack the caravan. Report to Hadvar.","Report for Duty[edit] At the Rift Imperial Camp, Legate Rikke will inform you that Anuriel, steward to the Jarl of Riften, is involved with the Thieves Guild. She wants you to obtain evidence of this so that it can be used to leverage her into cooperating with the effort to regain the Rift for the Empire. She informs you that the mission will require ""stealth and discretion"". If asked, she will tell you that your destination is Riften and mark Mistveil Keep on your map. Find the Evidence[edit] The evidence is inside a dresser in Anuriel's room. You may prefer to do this quest midday, while she is in the main hall rather than in her room. Although not always necessary, you may wish to take some steps to make yourself stealthy as you must evade a guard who patrols the hallway leading to Anuriel's room and then steal the item undetected. If this guard sees you, he will warn you a few times that you are trespassing and may then attack you if you remain in his presence. However, you may also avoid this guard by waiting until he walks to the other end of his beat. If you stand in front of the Jarl facing her, you will see an open door to a hallway behind. A guard patrols the interior of this hallway. Watch for him to pass. After he walks to the left, wait a second or two, then go in and take a right. Anuriel's room is just around a corner. Steal the incriminating letter from inside the dresser, making sure that you are not observed. As an extra precaution, you may wish to close the door before you take it. Once you've taken the letter, show it to Anuriel. Confront Anuriel[edit] Once you've shown Anuriel the letter, she'll lower her voice and ask you to follow her to discuss the matter privately. She informs you that if you stick closely to her, the guards won't bother you. She will lead you back into her room. Once in the room, any conversation you have with her will result in her offering to give you information about a large shipment of gold and weapons in exchange for your silence. A successful persuasion will also cause her to offer a leveled amount of gold in advance, albeit angrily. Anuriel will tell you that the valuables are being transported by a wagon caravan in the area of Windhelm. She will relate that the wagon is heavy, and thus will be slow-moving, but is also heavily guarded. Levels Reward(if Persuadesucceeded)   1–9 500   10–19 750   20–29 1,000   30–39 1,250   40+ 1,500 Report back to Legate Rikke[edit] Inform Legate Rikke about the wagon. She will be pleased to learn of this, and will tell you that she has some scouts positioned in the area where the wagon is traveling. She will ask you to meet the men, overpower the rebels guarding it, and take possession of the valuables. She will mark your map with the rendezvous location, which is about halfway between Riften and Windhelm. Meet the Men[edit] Upon arriving you'll find an old ally, Hadvar, commanding the Imperial scout troops. He will acknowledge your past adventures and engage in some philosophizing about war and killing. You can skip this dialogue if you like. When you mention the wagon, Hadvar will inform you that he was tracking it already, and is curious how you know about its cargo. You can tell him or not. Depending on your dialogue choices, you may learn that the wagon is now stranded a short distance away, and that you are outnumbered by the rebels. Ambush the Rebels[edit] Hadvar will say that he has a plan. If asked about it, he will suggest that although you are outnumbered, you can even the odds by employing the following strategy: First, he says that ""we"" will take out the Stormcloak sentry and then he and his scouts will situate themselves overlooking the camp. Then, you are to infiltrate the Stormcloak's position and create a distraction, at which time the scouts will unleash an archery attack. You can agree to this or let him know that you'll handle it on your own. If you agree to work together with Hadvar, you can proceed immediately or tell him to wait. If it is daytime, you can suggest that you wait until nighttime, which he will think is a good idea. If you suggest waiting, you can let him know when you are ready. Once you do so, you will note in your journal that will now follow him and ambush the enemy scout. A vantage point for ambushing the sentry Hadvar will suggest that you follow him, keep low, and hold your fire. He will walk and then stop a short distance away and may say ""We'll take care of the sentry when he makes his next round."" He may also tell you ""Fire on my word"". Hadvar and his men will crouch in a sneaking position and face directly north with weapons drawn. From the plan he originally laid out, it may seem that you are to wait until Hadvar and his scouts take out the sentry; this will never happen. Apparently when Hadvar said ""we"" will take out the sentry, he meant that you will take out the sentry. The closest way to follow the plan is apparently to place yourself just in front of Hadvar, facing the same direction as the others. Sneaking, creep forward through the two trees in front of you. Ahead of you, the sentry pauses at the far right end of a patrol route, offering the best position for targeting with an arrow. You may need to move slightly ahead and to the left to see the place where the sentry pauses. When the sentry is killed, your objective updates to ""Take over the caravan."" While Hadvar will repeat the idea that you are to sneak into the camp while his team positions themselves above it, things will again go not quite according to plan: quite likely, only Hadvar will position himself above the camp and attack with arrows. The other two soldiers will run directly into the camp and begin fighting. You have no chance to ""infiltrate the camp,"" as was suggested. Your allies will generally take care of the Stormcloaks with or without your help, and the battle should be quite easily won. After the last enemy falls, your objective will update to ""Report to Hadvar."" If you then merely approach Hadvar, he will remark that you ""make quite a team."" Your work here is done, and the quest will complete at this point. You can then loot the camp, including the chest of valuables in the back of the wagon, although this is supposed to be collected later to support the war effort. If you will continue to pursue The Reunification of Skyrim quest, report back to Legate Rikke at the Rift Imperial Camp to obtain orders for your final mission to regain the Rift. When you approach her, she will acknowledge your performance, reward you with leveled gold, and say that she ""will send some men to collect the prize. We can use the weapons here, and I'll send the coin to Solitude."" Reward[edit] Levels Reward   1–9 400   10–19 600   20–29 800   30–39 1,000   40+ 1,200"

Head to Markarth and go into the Understone Keep. Find Raerek's quarters, located to the right as you walk towards the throne. There is a guard there who may or may not talk to you. Don't go up the stairs; instead, take a right and look left. Guards frequently patrol the halls at all hours, however Raerek will be attending to the Jarl throughout most of the day. Sneak in the room, you need to pick the lock, so make sure you have some lockpicks with you. In the dresser against the wall, directly in sight from the doorway, you will find an inscribed amulet of Talos. Show the amulet to Raerek and he will tell you to follow him, leading you to his quarters. When you get in his quarters he will immediately start dialogue, assuming you want to extort something from him. Asking him if you could come to some sort of agreement will have him mention a shipment of silver and weapons; selecting any topic except the ""All right, it's a deal"" one will give you the chance to use speech to gain a leveled amount of gold.

After telling him that there is a shipment of coin heading to Solitude, he will tell you to meet with some of his scouts that are situated along the road and ambush the wagon. Once you find them, speak with their leader Ralof. He will inform you that the wagon had an accident and is stranded up the road. He will then tell you that he and his men will eliminate the sentry on top of the hill and that you should go in and distract the Imperials so that the Stormcloaks can shoot them. You can also tell them to stay there while you just go in and slaughter. If you decide to go with Ralof's plan, tell him you're ready and then creep along with him and his men until he stops at a rock. He will then command his men to fire, and they will kill the guard on the ledge and take up positions along it. Now you have to head down to the Imperials. When you approach them, they will pull out their swords and tell you to move along. Simply attack them and Ralof's men will begin shooting the Imperials. Kill all the Imperials and talk to Ralof. That will complete the quest and you will have to head back to Galmar."

No Time for Grief[edit] Cross the bridge, where Faralda and Arniel will be waiting. Faralda will inquire about the situation. Explain that Winterhold is in imminent danger and proceed to the town. Faralda and Arniel will follow and assist you in the battle that awaits. You will find the town has become infested with a swarm of magic anomalies—fast moving balls of energy  whose attacks deliver frost damage. They explode upon defeat, leaving behind soul gems in their ""ghostly remains"". Faralda and Arniel prove valuable allies in this battle and, with their help, you defeat the ten anomalies and secure the town. Arniel will remain in the town while you return to the College to report back to Mirabelle. The Staff of Magnus[edit] When you find Mirabelle, she will tell you that she and Tolfdir are trying to keep the Eye contained, but are in dire need of the Staff of Magnus. When you tell her that you must venture to Labyrinthian for the staff, she softens a bit from her concern and grief. She intimates that Savos Aren had just recently given her a mysterious torc, cryptically telling her that she would know what to do with it when the time came, and she believes it was meant for you. She also gives you Savos Aren's amulet to aid you on your journey, believing that you will be better served by it.  The Staff of Magnus quest begins here."

His name is Nikulas, and he is a good lad, a strong and loyal young man. However, Edla wishes her son wasn't so eager to leave the village. If you are willing to talk to him, she will be quite happy.

When you reach the door to Esbern's room in the Ratway Warrens, he is cautious of Thalmor agents and initially refuses you entry. You may persuade him by saying Delphine sent you, you can tell him the password Delphine gave you: ""Where were you on the 30th of Frostfall?"", or you may explain that you are the Dragonborn. The Dragon's Return[edit] Once Esbern lets you in, he shares his dire predictions about the world: Alduin the World-Eater's return has apocalyptic implications, and Esbern's warnings of this threat have been ignored. He makes it clear that there was no hope until you arrived and that he believed the world was going to end. He agrees to follow you to Delphine's base in Riverwood. Before leaving, Esbern will quickly search his room for any sensitive information the Thalmor might find. He will also gather some supplies from the chest at the foot of his bed and then be ready to leave. The quest ends here, and the next quest, Alduin's Wall, begins."

You will be directed to visit the Silver-Blood Inn in Markarth to seek out rumors that might have crossed the border from High Rock. Once at the inn, your quest marker will direct you to a guest room containing a book named Crypt of the Heart - Draft. Reading it will reveal the story of the Order of the Crypt, a knightly order from Shornhelm, and the tragic tale of a knight named Simon Rodayne who fell in love with (or was tricked by) a witch of the Beldama Wyrd named Daenella. Their relationship brought the order into conflict with the witches, driving the coven further and further east. It is said that Simon's ghost haunts the banks of the Karth River, below his hilltop tomb. You will then be directed to investigate these ghost sightings by travelling to a bridge that crosses the Karth River just next to Reachcliff Secret Entrance. On this bridge, you will find a lone red mountain flower; when approached, a Ghost Knight will appear behind you and will wander off to the south, towards Dushnikh Yal. Follow the ghost as it makes its way up the slope. It will guide you to a grave west of Dushnikh Yal, which is surrounded by three hostile Forsworn. Kill the attackers and loot the Forsworn Shaman's body. She will be carrying a Forsworn Shaman's Note, which you must read to progress the quest. It reveals that the Beldama Wyrd has come to the Reach in search of Daenella in order to punish her for her betrayal. They have taken Simon's heart from his grave and have brought it to Karthspire Camp to defile it. Surrounding the grave, you will find the bodies of two Knights of the Crypt who had been sent to the Reach to track down and kill the Beldama witches. If you wish, you can loot their bodies for a full set of Iron Spell Knight Armor and Steel Spell Knight Armor.  Daenella and her lover's heart A Stolen Heart[edit] Journey to Karthspire Camp and prepare for a fight; the campsite is swarming with Forsworn, and with this Creation installed you will have to deal with the added threat of Beldama Witches and a hagraven called the Beldama Ward Mother. They are located on the eastern side of the camp. Once you've subdued the many enemies at the campsite, approach the sacrificial altar where the Beldama witches are found. On it, you will find the corpse of Daenella, who had been captured by the witches and killed with the knowledge that the Ward Mother planned to corrupt her beloved's heart and return it to his grave tainted, damning his soul for eternity. Sure enough, you will find a Corrupted Human Heart on a pedestal in front of the altar. Take it and return to the knight's grave.  A Choice[edit] Lovers reunited A set of ebony armor is your reward Once you have the heart, you will be instructed to return it to the knight's grave, with the optional step of first purifying the heart of corruption. If you choose to place the corrupted heart within the grave, the corrupted spirit of Simon Rodayne will appear and attack you for damning his soul. He wields a bound sword in combat. Once you banish the ghost, you will be directed to loot his grave for a full set of enchanted Ebony Spell Knight Armor in order to complete the quest. This set has enchantments focused on offense (see Spell Knight Armor items). If you instead wish to purify his heart, you must first activate the Shrine of Mara found at his tomb. Once this is done, place Simon Rodayne's Heart within his grave. This will cause a brief apparition of Simon and Daenella, finally reunited in death. The ghostly lovers will then disappear, and in their place a full set of enchanted Ebony Spell Knight Armor will materialize above the grave. This set has enchantments focused on defense. Take the armor to complete the quest. Regardless of which option you choose, you will now be able to craft Spell Knight armor from iron, steel, and ebony at any forge, provided you have the necessary skill perks."

Approaching Gjalund, he will proudly state, ""If you're looking for passage to Solstheim, you won't find a finer vessel than the Northern Maiden."" From this you can choose to either ask how much the fare is (250 gold) or to further inquire about the island. If you choose to question him about Solstheim, he will exclaim ""Surprised you've never heard of it. It's an island northeast of here. Has a small dark elf town called Raven Rock and a handful of Nords living in Skaal Village. People don't usually sail over there unless they have a particular reason. It can be a pretty rough place."" Once you pay the fare, he will tell you ""You've got yourself a ship. We'll cast off immediately."" If you change your mind, he will sternly say ""Suit yourself. I'll be here if you change your mind."" Finding Answers[edit] Note: This section refers to dialogue options if you have previously encountered the cultists. Having already encountered the cultists, approaching Gjalund will have a somewhat different response: ""If you're looking for passage to Solstheim, too bad. I'm not going back there anymore."" From this point onward you have several dialogue options to choose from. If you choose to ask him if he's the captain, he will suspiciously confirm ""Sure. Yeah. That's me. Why? Who sent you?"" Stating that you were attacked by the cultists, he will exclaim ""Now hold on! That wasn't my fault... I didn't know they were going to attack anybody. I don't even know how I got here."" Further questioning him will lead him to tell you ""It's hard to explain... I remember those people with the masks coming on board, then... Next thing I remember, I was here and they were gone.

Upon arrival at the docks of Raven Rock on Solstheim, if you have never been here before, you will be approached by Adril Arano, the Second Councilor of Raven Rock. At this first meeting he sternly greets you with, ""I don't recognize you, so I'll assume this is your first visit to Raven Rock, outlander. State your intentions.""  Depending on quest actions, you are given two or three options to reply to him. If you have already started the quest, you can question him if he knows someone named Miraak, to which he will reply, ""Miraak... I... I'm not sure that I do."" Further questioning him, he will respond ""I... I'm unsure. I swear I know the name, but cannot place it."" Pressing him further about the issue, he will then reveal, ""I don't think so. I'm not... The name has something to do with the Earth Stone, I think. But I'm not sure what."" This now gives you the optional objective to investigate the shrine. Regardless of which, Adril will then depart the conversation by saying ""Just remember, Raven Rock is sovereign territory of House Redoran. This is Morrowind, not Skyrim. While you're here you will be expected to abide by our laws.""  The location of the Earth Stone is almost directly west of the docks, a short distance away from the settlement of Raven Rock. However, visiting the stone itself is purely an optional objective and is not necessary in order to advance through the quest.  The Earth Stone[edit] ""Here in his shrine, that they have forgotten. Here do we toil, that we might remember. By night we reclaim, what by day was stolen. Far from ourselves, he grows ever near to us. Our eyes once were blinded, now through him do we see. Our hands once were idle, now through them does he speak. And when the world shall listen, and when the world shall see, and when the world remembers, that world will cease to be.""  ""You there... You don't seem to be in quite the same state as the others here. Very interesting. May I ask what it is you're doing here?"" Upon arrival at the stone, you will notice several of the inhabitants of Raven Rock alongside some of the Redoran guards working on what appears to be a mysterious shrine surrounding the stone. Walk toward the shrine and you will be approached by Neloth, a Telvanni wizard, and you may ask him about what is happening. He will either remark: ""You there... You don't seem to be in quite the same state as the others here. Very interesting. May I ask what it is you're doing here?"", or simply ask you what brings you to Raven Rock. When you explain to Neloth that you are searching for Miraak, he will exclaim: ""Miraak... Miraak... It sounds familiar, and yet I can't quite place... Oh. Wait, I recall. But that makes very little sense. Miraak's been dead for thousands of years."" Inquire about the meaning of this and he will answer: ""I'm not sure, but it is fascinating, isn't it? Perhaps it has some relation to what's going on here. Quite unexpected. I'm afraid I can't give you any answers. But there are ruins of an ancient temple of Miraak's toward the center of the island. If I were you, I'd look there."" This will now direct you towards the Temple of Miraak to investigate further about the cultist attack. You may also choose to further question Neloth. Asking what exactly they are building, he will reply: ""Building something, clearly. And yet they don't seem to have much to say about it. I'm very interested to find out what happens when they finish."" If you also question him as to stopping the workers, he will exclaim: ""Certainly not! Doing so would interfere with whatever is going on, and I would be unable to see how this all turns out.""  Temple of Miraak[edit] ""Here in my temple, here in my shrine, that you have forgotten. Here do you toil, that you might remember. Here you reclaim, what faithless minds have stolen. Far from yourself, I grow ever nearer to you. Your eyes once were blinded, now through me do you see. Your hands once were idle, now through them do I speak. And when the world shall listen, and when the world shall see, and when the world remembers, that world will cease to be.""  Dragon skeletons litter the pathway leading up to the temple. If you choose not to visit the Earth Stone, you can speak with various citizens of Raven Rock about Miraak. You will realize that most citizens recognize the name, but are uncertain why, just like Adril. Some will again mention the Earth Stone, while others will mention the Temple of Miraak. Once you've been told about the location of the temple, a new objective marker will lead you there. In order to reach the temple, head east from Raven Rock, towards the center of Solstheim. As you approach the exterior of the temple, you'll see skeletons of several dragons littering the pathway leading up to the temple. As you climb up the stairs and further to the temple, you'll see many of Miraak's thralls working to rebuild it. They will also be chanting, as were the thralls at the Earth Stone. None of the enthralled people will attack you, but some cultists will appear and become aggressive if you wait outside of the temple too long. Once you reach the center of the exterior portion of the Temple of Miraak, near the Tree Stone, this quest will be complete, and the next quest will begin automatically. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked during this quest if you have not yet visited Solstheim: Outlander (20 points/Bronze) — Arrive on Solstheim"

Astrid reveals that Cicero attempted to murder her and the other members of the Dark Brotherhood, grievously wounding Veezara in the process. Arnbjorn pursued Cicero as he fled from the sanctuary. She asks you to search Cicero's room for clues as to his whereabouts. Inside the room you find five journals, with the final journal indicating that Cicero might be headed for the long-abandoned sanctuary outside Dawnstar. Astrid will grant you use of her horse, Shadowmere. Immediately outside the sanctuary he will rise from the black, bubbling liquid. Mount him if you wish, and head to Dawnstar's abandoned Brotherhood sanctuary. Dawnstar Sanctuary[edit] You will find an injured Arnbjorn outside the sanctuary. He reveals that he and Cicero seriously wounded each other before Cicero escaped into the safety of the sanctuary and instructs you to ""just follow the blood"". A pass phrase is needed to enter the sanctuary; it can be found in the final volume of Cicero's journal (""Innocence, my brother""). Once inside, Cicero will begin to speak to you, taunting, as you search for him.  At this point, summon Lucien Lachance for a bit more on the story. He strongly suggests that the Dread Father would not want you to kill Cicero. While the sanctuary is abandoned, it is not unoccupied. It is inhabited by ghosts of the previous Dark Brotherhood residents, who will attack on sight. The elusive Udefrykte also resides in one of the sanctuary's caves; it may be advisable to simply sneak by the troll when discovered. As you make your way along, the second room is a circular chamber with another room below and a bridge. The spike trap can be avoided by avoiding the bridge and crawling along the left-hand wall; there is enough of a ledge to allow this.  Across the bridge at the foot of the stairs, you will find two skill books: Fire and Darkness and The Marksmanship Lesson. Keeper of The Old Ways[edit] At the end, you will find Cicero curled up in a fetal position, apparently injured. Cicero cautions you that the Night Mother will not be happy if you kill him. At this point it is your choice whether to kill him or not. If you attack him he leaps to his feet, obviously unhurt, and gleefully screams ""Haha! Behold the final trick of the Fool of Hearts! You think me near death? Haha! Think again."" If you decide not to kill him, he returns to serve and tend to the Night Mother after you complete Hail Sithis!. He will also be a follower.  Whatever your decision, the quest is now complete. Speak to Astrid to begin your next mission."

Defeat the giant. Take Shagrol's Hammer back to Largashbur. Place Shagrol's Hammer on the shrine in Largashbur. Collect your reward.","Giant Attack[edit] A giant attacking the Orcs at Largashbur The Orc camp is located in The Rift southwest of Riften. As you approach the town for the first time, a giant will be actively attacking the Orcs at the gate. It's advisable to hurry in and help distract the giant, as it will kill unnamed Orcs left and right and may kill potential followers such as Ugor. After defeating the giant, Ugor and a caster named Atub will begin bickering. Atub will apologize to you and explain that their tribe and leader have been cursed. She has a ritual that may be able to remove it, but needs a bowl of troll fat and a daedra heart to perform it. She'll ask you to retrieve them. Details on where to find them are provided on their individual pages, however the closest place to get both items is in the Jorrvaskr Living Quarters in Whiterun.  Malacath's Ritual[edit] ""Now, we begin the ritual..."" After you bring the ingredients to Atub, she will enter Largashbur Longhouse and speak with Chief Yamarz about performing the ritual. The Chief isn't thrilled about the ritual, but ultimately agrees to follow her out to the altar. Atub successfully reaches Malacath, whose disembodied voice berates Yamarz for his weakness, abhorring Yamarz for being so weak that even giants openly attack his stronghold. Malacath demands that he kill the giant's leader and return with his club as an offering. Yamarz is irked and demands your assistance in his task, promising lots of gold for helping him.  Hammer Time[edit] ""I'll lead the way, but you'd better back me up."" Yamarz will run off towards Fallowstone Cave. If you fast travel there you'll meet him at the entrance and avoid the long trek. He leads the way through the cave, which is remarkably spacious, but rather straightforward. Bears and trolls dwell in the cave and pose some threat, but the giant in the huge main chamber should be far enough away to be avoided entirely. Yamarz will charge down several ledges following the flow of a stream to a pool on the lowest level. He will continue to follow the stream deeper into the cave out of the main chamber and into a smaller cavern occupied by a second giant that can't be so easily avoided. Continue down the tunnel to the southeast as it wends its way around to a final small chamber littered with bones, likely from the predation of the two bears that make it their home. After dealing with them, follow the quest marker up the path to the left and out to Giant's Grove.  Yamarz's Fork[edit] Once in the grove, Yamarz will offer to pay you even more gold if you kill the giant yourself and let him take credit. Either way, you're left fighting the giant in a very small area. ""Of course, I can't let you leave here alive. Wouldn't want anyone finding out.""Help YamarzIf you agree, or if you just kill the giant on your own, he will betray you afterwards, saying that no one can ever know the truth of what happened here. He is extremely well-armored and has tremendous blocking ability, but doesn't hit hard. After killing him, Malacath will praise you for removing both the giant and the conniving, weakling chief. He asks you to take Shagrol's Hammer back to Largashbur and whip the other Orcs back into shape.    ""This should only take a second.""Honor Malacath's WishesIf you persuade Yamarz to perform his duty, he'll be killed almost immediately by the giant and you'll be left to kill the giant anyway. Malacath will again deride the fallen weakling Chief and send you back to Largashbur. After defeating the giant, the only way out is back via Fallowstone - only this time you get to the entrance via a long ledge. Just after you enter back into the cave, take the tunnel almost immediately to your left, and follow the ledge round to the left, past the locked chest (unlock and loot, if you've not done so already). Keep going until you see the waterfall ahead of you, then jump down and cross the stream just in front of the waterfall, then follow the route back to the cave entrance. Claiming Volendrung[edit] A gift from Malacath Once you return, speak with Atub and tell her of Yamarz's fate. Malacath will speak once more, naming Gularzob the new chief. He will command you to place Shagrol's Hammer on the shrine, where it transforms into the fearsome Volendrung, the Hammer of Might. Make sure you take it from the shrine where it rests in the skull's antlers."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:A_Daedra%27s_Best_Friend","Talk to Lod in Falkreath. Track down Barbas. Travel with Barbas to Haemar's Shame. Retrieve the Rueful Axe for Clavicus Vile. Give the Rueful Axe to Clavicus Vile or kill Barbas.","Man's Best Friend[edit] A stray dog outside Falkreath Once you reach the required level, a trip to Falkreath will net you an encounter with a guard asking a rather unusual question, namely if you have seen a stray dog running around outside town. Regardless of your answer, he will then point you to the local blacksmith, Lod, who can be found working his smithy during the day. When approached Lod will only show interest in one specific dog, a 'fine, strong creature that's been wandering near town', that he would like for you to catch for him. You can either accept his request to chase down the dog or pass a very easy Speech check to persuade him to pay you part of the gold up-front for your efforts. In either case, Lod will give you some fresh meat for bait. Travel along the road a short distance southwest of town. A dog will approach and enthusiastically address you, saying ""You are exactly what I was looking for"". He will introduce himself as Barbas and will ask for your help. Choose the second dialogue option for a bit of background explanation. Barbas will describe a falling-out that he had with his master, and says that he needs someone who can settle the disagreement. Taunting Barbas will make him reveal his master to be Daedric Prince Clavicus Vile, who governs over bargains. You agree to arbitrate this disagreement and Barbas tells you that Vile is probably close to a cult of worshippers living near Haemar's Shame. Barbas will then be on his way towards this cavern, and you will have to follow him on a long journey. Note that traveling with Barbas can be avoided by postponing his request during the second set of dialogue responses; select ""You were looking for me?"" followed by ""I've got things to do"". This will make Barbas travel to Haemar's Shame alone. You can then make your way to the shrine when you are ready. If you haven't discovered Haemar's Shame, you can travel to Helgen and head east for a relatively uneventful trip. If you choose this option, you can skip the next section. A Long Journey[edit] Haemar's Shame is located a long way from Falkreath, at the foot of the Throat of the World, straight east from the ruined town of Helgen. Following Barbas can be difficult as Barbas tends to get lost on occasion, so keep an eye on the map marker. The first distraction comes when you and Barbas face an unmarked bridge guarded by bandits, just west of Falkreath. Barbas cannot be killed because he is invulnerable, so just fight the opposition and keep an eye on the dog, who may wander off. Follow Barbas past Pinewatch and up the mountain towards Helgen. The trip goes through the destroyed town, now occupied by bandits, so help Barbas fight them. When all is said and done, Barbas will open the eastern gate himself and continue towards the Throat of the World. When you finally reach Haemar's Shame, Barbas will enter right away so follow him inside. Haemar's Shame[edit] Clavicus Vile obviously suffered the same fate as many other daedric princes, and his shrine is now hidden away in a damp tomb. His worshipers consist of leveled vampires who will protect the shrine with their lives. The first room offers an enemy guarding the wooden structure and a chest. Barbas will run ahead, so you will likely be on your own. Take the eastern tunnel and beware of the spike wall trap ahead. The next chamber contains a campfire and a charred skeever guarded by two vampires. Dispose of them and investigate the wooden structure for an alchemy lab and another chest. Take the only available tunnel to a chamber in two levels, with several enemies to fight. Take a detour to the southern chamber for some loot, and examine the table on your way down for the Destruction skill book Response to Bero's Speech, then pick the northern tunnel and exit Haemar's Cavern. Barbas curing vampirism! In the next zone, Haemar's Shame, head through the tunnel and kill the residing frostbite spider. An arcane enchanter can be found in the next room, along with a soul gem and common books. Head downstream and fight the opposition until you reach the Shrine of Clavicus Vile, guarded by a boss-leveled vampire. Evident by his barking, Barbas will already be there, busy fighting the boss. After the fight, Barbas will sit in front of the statue with nothing to say but the occasional ""Woof"". Head up to the statue, activate it, and ask Clavicus Vile if you can make a request. He'll agree to hear it by saying, Clavicus Vile: ""By all means, let's hear it. It's the least I could do, since you already helped me grant one final wish for my last worshipers... They were suffering so from vampirism, and begged me for a cure. Then you came and ended their misery! I couldn't have planned it better myself. So, what's your heart's desire? What kind of deal can we strike?"" If you mention Barbas, he will deny the request but then equivocate. Clavicus Vile:""Ugh. That insufferable pup? Forget it. Request denied. No deal. I'm glad to be rid of him. Even if it does mean I'm stuck in this pitiful shrine, in the back end of... nowhere. Well... perhaps there is a way he could earn his place back at my side. Maybe. But no promises."" You can also ask for an end to the Civil War in Skyrim to which Clavicus will reply, ""Oh, if I had my full power, granting that would be trivial. I'd simply snap my fingers, and everyone in Skyrim would die. War resolved."" You can also ask for power to which Clavicus will reply, ""Really? Power? You're a dragonborn; you already have more power than most people who aren't immense fire-breathing monsters."" or ""Really? Power? Haven't you already killed enough of your foes using the more mundane means at your disposal? Swords, magic, etc.? How...uninspired."", depending on whether or not you have completed Dragon Rising. Clavicus will conclude the last two options with: ""As much as I hate to say it, you're almost as powerful as I am right now. But that's just because half of my power resides in that mutt, Barbas. Come to think of it, I know of a win-win situation for both of us."" Whatever option you pick, Clavicus is only interested in one thing, the Rueful Axe, an axe powerful enough for Clavicus to have ""quite a bit of fun"". Clavicus will reveal that the axe is located in Rimerock Burrow and will ask you to take Barbas with you. Talking to Barbas will provide a bit of background information on the axe: Barbas: ""One of Clavicus's little jests. A wizard named Sebastian Lort had a daughter who worshiped Hircine. When the daughter became a werewolf it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn't stand to see his little girl take on such a bestial form. The wizard wished for the ability to end his daughter's curse. Clavicus gave him an axe."" Rimerock Burrow[edit] Barbas throws himself at Sebastian Lort Rimerock Burrow is located on the hillside in the northwest corner of the map and can be tricky to find, especially if you approach it from the wrong angle. Take the road leading south from Lost Echo Cave and follow it as it twists and turns. At the crossroads, take the snowy path leading northwest and you will get straight to the entrance. You can also take the ferry from Dawnstar to Icewater Jetty, then travel southeast and scale the cliff side until you reach the entrance. Once inside, you will encounter a hostile leveled atronach, presumably created by Sebastian Lort as an extra guardian. Sebastian himself can be found in the next room, equally hostile and will not hesitate to use his conjuration spells. After the battle, claim the Rueful Axe from the table and examine the room for a bit of loot, an arcane enchanter and the Conjuration skill book 2920, Hearth Fire, v9 on Sebastian's nightstand in the following room. It is now time to return to Clavicus Vile in Haemar's Shame. Put Him Out of Our Misery![edit] Barbas at Clavicus Vile's statue Back at Haemar's Shame, the map marker will point towards the cavern entrance, which will force you to travel through the entire cave system once again. To circumvent this, head west up the road until the path bends. A pine is growing on the left, against the mountain wall; the back entrance is behind this tree below the top of the tree. Reaching the back entrance is fairly easy. If you reach the first piled-up set of rocks on the left, you've gone too far. Note that this only works if you previously opened the spike gate by pulling the chain behind Clavicus Vile's statue. Otherwise, the gate will be closed and you will not be able to access the room. Inside the cavern, Barbas will once again sit in front of his master. When approached, Clavicus Vile has one final prank to play and will give you a choice: you can keep the Rueful Axe if you use it to kill Barbas. The dog will understandably jump up and try to tell you that it is not the only option available. Speak to Barbas and Clavicus Vile for further elaboration and make a decision. Kill Barbas and keep the Rueful Axe, or hand the axe to Clavicus Vile and receive his true daedric artifact, namely the Masque of Clavicus Vile. Note that both items are unique, but only the Masque of Clavicus Vile counts towards the Oblivion Walker achievement, so it is recommended to keep Barbas alive. Regardless of your choice, Barbas and Clavicus Vile will be reunited and you will receive your reward. Finally, return to Lod in Falkreath for a small amount of gold and his gratitude."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Dainty_Sload","Talk to Delvin Mallory in Riften. Find out the mission details from Erikur in Solitude. Acquire Balmora Blue from Sabine Nytte. Travel to the Dainty Sload. Plant the Balmora Blue. Return to Erikur.","A Special Job[edit] Once you've completed five jobs in the city of Solitude, speak to Delvin in The Ragged Flagon to receive a special job. Delvin explains that he has received word from Solitude about an opportunity. Erikur is an influential thane and businessman in Solitude. Apparently, he is ""lookin' to run some kind of a shill job"". Completing this job will not only earn you a reward, it is a chance for the Guild to regain some influence in the city. Travel to Solitude and speak with Erikur, who can be found during the day at the Blue Palace. When you speak to Erikur, he explains the story behind the job: ""Nothing raises my ire more than having an agreement broken. It's bad for business and it wastes time. Captain Volf of the Dainty Sload has decided to test my patience on this matter by neglecting to honor a trade agreement we had established.""  Your job is to frame Volf for possession of an illicit substance by acquiring some very rare, very illegal Balmora Blue and planting it in his footlocker. From One Pirate to Another[edit] Sabine's Footlocker, hidden beneath the dock leading to the Red Wave. Your contact for the contraband is a crew member aboard the pirate ship, the Red Wave. The Red Wave is docked outside the East Empire Company Warehouse just outside Solitude. Your contact, Sabine Nytte, will be on deck, waiting for you. Tell her what you're looking for, and she will ask for 1,500 gold for some Balmora Blue, claiming that she's the only person in Tamriel who can obtain it.  If you accept her price, she gives you the key and directs you to the contraband, which is in a locked chest directly under the docks adjacent to The Red Wave.  If you do not wish to pay such inflated prices, sneak into the bottom deck of the ship and locate the Red Wave Safe, which is guarded by a Master-level lock. Inside, you will learn from a note that the contraband is located ""under the Wave"", leading you to Sabine's Footlocker (though reading the note is not necessary for you to loot the contraband). Swim down below the docks and pick the Expert-level lock to the chest and take the Balmora Blue. Note that both locks can be skipped by pickpocketing the corresponding keys off of Sabine first. A Pirate Breaks the Law[edit] Make your way out to the Dainty Sload, anchored near Solitude's Lighthouse. There are two corsairs guarding the entrance to the interior of the ship. One remains looking out to sea, while another roams the deck. Engage them or sneak below deck through the unlocked door. Inside, there are more corsairs to deal with. Whether by sneaking or defeating the corsairs, head down the stairs into the bottom of the ship, then back up again until you reach the Captain's room. The ship's first mate guards the area and has a high detection level. The Captain's Chest is your target and you can pick the adept lock, or you can kill the First Mate and take the key. On the table is an Unusual Gem and the Speech skill book A Dance in Fire, V6. Plant the Balmora Blue and make your way back to the entrance. Revenge is Sweet[edit] Travel back to Erikur at the Blue Palace (or at his home), who is very pleased with the fruits of your labor. He'll reward you with a random spell tome, and the assurance that he will re-open any doors in Solitude to facilitate the Guild's return. Report back to Delvin. He'll give you your pay, and will compliment you on your actions, ""Erikur assures me that Captain Volf will spend pretty much the rest of his life clapped in irons. Best of all, he's also pledged to open doors for us in Solitude and to get things rollin' again"". He then points out that the added infamy you earned the guild has attracted a new merchant to The Ragged Flagon."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dampened_Spirits","Speak to Maven Black-Briar. Meet Mallus Maccius at The Bannered Mare. Speak to Sabjorn in the Honningbrew Meadery. Engage in some industrial sabotage and witness the mead tasting failure. Acquire the promissory note and return to Maven.","Preparation[edit] As you will be battling Ataxia-bearing skeevers, resist disease or cure disease potions or enchantments are useful. Furthermore, given the vermin's speed, a fast, light melee weapon is advised. Given Hamelyn's magical ability, resist magic, shock, fire, and frost spells or enchantments are useful. Black-Briar Business[edit] Now that you're a full member of the Thieves Guild, you've been told that Maven Black-Briar wants to see you. You are likely to find her on the second floor of The Bee and Barb. After a condescending greeting, Maven will solicit your cooperation in putting her competitor, the Honningbrew Meadery, out of business. She will also ask you to perform some industrial espionage to understand how Honningbrew could have started up their operation and achieved success so quickly. She will direct you to meet Mallus Maccius at The Bannered Mare in Whiterun for further instructions. Meet Mallus Maccius[edit] Mallus will tell you that Sabjorn, Honningbrew's owner, is planning to hold a special tasting for an important personage, and that you must poison the mead for the occasion. He suggests that you approach Sabjorn and offer to help him with a pest infestation, then use the poison he will give you to accomplish the deed. He instructs you to access the mead vats through a tunnel leading there from the meadery's basement. Although he claims you could alternatively pick the lock on the brewery door, you can't, as it requires a key which is only found inside the boilery. His own motives are quite simple: he'll be given control of the meadery from Maven once Sabjorn is out of the way. Infestation Elimination[edit] Sabjorn will quickly accept your offer to help and provide you with the required poison as well as the key to the Meadery. If you successfully persuade him, he'll even give you half your pay upfront (500 gold) - although the way things turn out, this is all you'll get from him. Option  Dialogue  Reaction   That's the only way I operate. (Persuade) Passed: Oh, very well. Here's half. You get the rest when the job's done.Failed: Well that's not how I operate, so forget it. Passed: Get 500 goldFailed: Nothing   You'd better, or I yell ""skeever."" (Intimidate) Passed: Okay, okay. No need to make rash decisions. Here's half. You get the rest when the job's done.Failed: Yell all you want. It's not going to change my mind. Passed: Get 500 goldFailed: Nothing   Just pay me when the job's done. My only demand is that these vermin are permanently eliminated before my reputation is completely destroyed. Nothing Sabjorn will also, if asked, talk about how he gets free labor from Maccius by trapping him into a debt he can't afford to repay.  In the basement, you'll easily find the tunnel Maccius pointed as the infestation's source. Fight your way past the tough Venomfang skeevers as well as a few frostbite spiders, taking care to avoid bear traps and tripwire-activated swinging maces along the way. You'll emerge in a large chamber where a mad bandit wizard named Hamelyn is guarded by several vermin. Try to use sneak to avoid fighting them all the same time, as Hamelyn can cast powerful destruction spells and is especially lethal if he catches you in a weakened condition. Poison the skeever nest next to Hamelyn's alchemy lab and don't miss the Sneak skill book Three Thieves lying atop a chest nearby. Press on, avoiding two bear traps, and you'll arrive at the door leading to the boilery. Mellow Mead[edit] Head up the stairs to a balcony overlooking the room and head towards the lone brewing vat on the far side. Poison it and exit using the Honningbrew Brewhouse key hanging on a hook on the right side of the door. Head back inside the meadery and you'll meet either Commander Caius or Sinmir (if the Stormcloaks have taken Whiterun) tasting the mead - Sabjorn will not pay you what he owes you yet (citing the need to go through with the mead tasting first), so if you got your 500 gold earlier, that's as good as it gets. The taster will sense something wrong with the drink and blame it on poor sanitary conditions. For this perceived offense, he will place Mallus Maccius in charge of the meadery and haul Sabjorn to jail at swordpoint - so you never DO get the rest of the pay (or any of it, if you didn't talk him into giving half in advance). Once Sabjorn has departed, speak to Mallus about gathering business intelligence for Maven and he'll hand over the key to Sabjorn's dresser. Head upstairs and steal the promissory note from the dresser. An expert-locked door nearby will open to reveal a room with some silver ingots, a silver necklace, some coin purses, and the Honningbrew Decanter, a miscellaneous unique item that can be sold to Delvin Mallory for a fair price. Be sure to read the Alchemy skill book A Game at Dinner, which is found on the table closest to the door. Mysterious Missive[edit] Head back to the Bee and Barb in Riften and report your success to Maven, who is frustrated by her inability to identify the note's author. When you point out the author's symbol is the same as that on the bill of sale previously found in the Goldenglow Estate safe she suggests taking it to Brynjolf. Provided you didn't kill anyone but Hamelyn, she will then pay you with a leveled enchanted sword or dagger. Once you're back in the Cistern, Brynjolf will muse that the identical symbol points to someone attempting to drive a wedge between Maven and the guild, and will send you off to Mercer to continue your search. Mallus will now also be available as a fence."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dark_Ancestor","Speak to Dengeir of Stuhn. Travel to Bloodlet Throne. Battle through and kill Vighar. Return to Dengeir.","A Dark Ancestry[edit] After stealing Lod's letter for Dengeir, he'll trust you enough to handle an important matter. It is of great concern and embarrassment to him that his ancestor Vighar is actually a vampire. For years he was magically bound within his grave, but the magic energies weakened and allowed him to escape. When asked, he will tell his family secret: ""You may have seen the open grave in our graveyard. Most of the townsfolk think it's the work of a corpse thief. The truth is less pleasant. It is...was, the grave of Vighar, my own ancestor, dead for centuries now. He is also a vampire. My family is entrusted with keeping him buried, but recently someone stole the wardstone, and Vighar escaped."" However, he is not interested in the stone, he just wants Vighar destroyed. ""No. It's too late for the wardstone. Vighar must be destroyed. If this gets out, my family will suffer great shame."" Dengeir has tracked him down to the vampire lair Bloodlet Throne and wants you to head there and destroy him before anyone discovers his family's secret shame. Bloodlet Throne[edit] Bloodlet Throne is a military fort hidden in the mountains southwest of Helgen. Travel to Helgen and leave through the east gate, taking the path leading southeast. Keep an eye on your map marker and make sure to take the right turns; never stray off the path, as it will lead directly to the fort. The exterior of the fort is unguarded, so climb the steps and enter. Once inside, the sound of howling wolves will meet you, along with a pressure plate triggering a flame trap right in front of you. Enter sneak mode and proceed forward. Before long, you will encounter two leveled vampires; pick the fight and proceed down the stairs into a large chamber. Take the eastern path and fight another vampire, feasting on severed hands in the dining room. Follow the snowy tunnel to yet another huge chamber with big wooden structures and more vampires, along with the expected wolf. Climb the woodworks and use the Arcane Enchanter and, in the next tunnel, the Alchemy Lab, then investigate the sleeping area for a bit of loot and a door leading to a room with the Illusion skill book Incident at Necrom and a random enchanted dagger on the table. Proceed to the snowy tunnel leading south and cross the bridge leading to Vighar in the final chamber. The Next Act of the Show[edit] The final chamber is obviously some kind of arena built to satisfy Vighar. As you approach, you will observe him seated on the ledge above, having a brief conversation with one of the other inhabitants: Vampire: ""And who is this?"" Vighar: ""It is no matter, this fool will be the next act of the show."" With these words, Vighar will pull the handle by his side and cause several wolves to be released from their cells. He will coldly observe while you fight them. As soon as you manage to kill them, Vighar himself will jump down and attack, backed up by his companions. When all is said and done, locate the pull chain in the western alcove and head upstairs. Follow the path to a chest with some loot, then remove the door bar and gain access to the first huge chamber. Exit Bloodlet Throne and return to Dengeir for your reward."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Darkness_Returns","Enter the Twilight Sepulcher. Speak to the Nightingale Sentinel. (Optional) Find Nystrom's Journal. Follow the Pilgrim's Path. Unlock the Ebonmere with the Skeleton Key. Listen to Nocturnal. Speak to Karliah. Choose a Nightingale blessing.","The Twilight Sepulcher[edit] Gallus's spirit guarding the entrance to the Twilight Sepulcher Once you enter the Twilight Sepulcher, you will come to a large hall where the spirit of a Nightingale Sentinel stands watch. When you approach him, he will initiate a conversation: ""I don't recognize you, but I sense that you're one of us. Who are you?"" ""I'd ask the same question of you."":  ""The last of the Nightingale Sentinels, I'm afraid. I've defended the Sepulcher alone for what seems like an eternity."" ""The last? What happened to the rest?"": ""We were betrayed by one of our own kind. In fact, I'm to blame for what's happened here."" ""How are you to blame?"": ""I was blinded. Blinded by dark treachery masquerading as friendship. Perhaps if I had been more vigilant, then Mercer Frey wouldn't have lured me to my fate and stolen the Skeleton Key."" ""Wait a moment... You're Gallus!"": ""I haven't heard that name in a long time. How do you know of me?"" ""I have the Key."": ""The Key! You have the Skeleton Key! I never thought I'd see it again. And Mercer Frey?"" ""Dead."": ""Then... it's over and my death wasn't in vain. I owe you a great deal, Nightingale."" From here, you will have the option of three replies: ""I did this for Nocturnal."" ""I did this to honor the Guild."" ""I did this to get rich.""   ""That's quite a noble sentiment for someone in our... well, in your line of work."" ""You've done the Guild a great deed. And although they may not show it, I'm certain they appreciate your sacrifices."" ""Were I able to provide it, I'd shower you in wealth for what you've done."" No matter which option you choose to reply with, Gallus will have the same response: ""My only regret is that you had to undertake this task alone."" ""Karliah helped me."" ""Karliah... she's still alive? I feared she'd befallen the same fate, ending up a victim of Mercer's betrayal."" ""Then take the Key and right all the wrongs."" ""Nothing would bring me more pride than to return the Key, but I'm afraid it's impossible. From the moment I arrived here, I've felt myself... well... dying."" ""How can a spirit die?"" ""The Sepulcher isn't merely a temple or a vault to house the Key. Within these walls is the Ebonmere... a conduit to Nocturnal's realm of Evergloam. When Mercer stole the Key, that conduit closed, severely limiting our ties to her."" ""Then I'll have to proceed alone."" ""I'm afraid so. I'm weakening, and I can feel myself slipping away. The years without restoration of my power have taken their toll. Whatever damage has been caused can only be corrected by following the Pilgrim's Path to the Ebonmere and replacing the Key."" If you inquire further about the Pilgrim's Path, Gallus will say ""I wish I could help you, but I've been a prisoner in this very chamber for the last quarter century. The only possible help I've come across are the remains of some poor fellow who was trying to follow in your footsteps. Perhaps his journal can help?"" This will present you with an optional goal to retrieve Nystrom's journal, which contains clues about the five ""tests"" you will face along the way. The journal is found on Nystrom's remains on the east side of the chamber, along with a leveled, enchanted weapon. The First Test[edit] ""Shadows of their former selves, sentinels of the dark. They wander ever more and deal swift death to defilers."" Nightingale Sentinels in the room of the first test Continue into the Sepulcher. In the first chamber, you will notice two Nightingale Sentinels reside here. One will be found in a room to the left, along with an alchemy lab and a secret chamber. The door to the secret chamber can be opened by pressing a button found behind the table. The other Sentinel can be found wandering near the steps in the main room. Starting a fight risks gaining the attention of both of them, so you can either choose to fight or try your luck in sneaking past them. Proceed onward into the next hallway, being mindful of the pressure plate in the hallway. On top of the stairs ahead, there is another Sentinel keeping watch. Note that the stairs themselves are pitch-black, but do not have any traps. Be careful however: if you use any form of light, it will likely attract the Sentinel. The Second Test[edit] ""Above all they stand, vigilance everlasting. Beholden to the murk yet contentious of the glow."" The darkened room of the second test The next chamber (and the second test you will face) is a room with brightly lit areas and a shadowy path running through them. Stick to the shadows here, since stepping into the light will result in continuous health damage that can quickly kill you. Note that if you're trying to level Restoration, this is a good place to do so; it is impossible to resist the damage (even with console commands or the Become Ethereal shout) as the damage caused by the light is scripted and will drain your health very rapidly (up to 100 points of damage per second) regardless of your level. The light damage is also affected by game difficulty, so be especially cautious if you are playing at higher difficulties. There are several tripwire-triggered dart traps along the shadowy path: the first one can be found as you make your way up the first flight of stairs, across the landing just ahead of you; the second tripwire is located just before you descend the second flight of stairs; the third tripwire is found just before you travel across a wooden bridge; the last one is located at the top of the last remaining stairs descending down. Once you reach the end of the chamber, proceed onward through the hallway until you reach the next room.  The Third Test[edit] ""Offer what She desires most, but reject the material. For her greatest want is that which cannot be seen, felt or carried."" A statue of Nocturnal in the room of the third test The third chamber is located at the end of the hallway, and contains a statue of Nocturnal, a dead bandit found on the floor, and a wooden tray with an offering of gold and soul gems. The third test along the Pilgrim's Path requires you to give Nocturnal an offering she desires: Darkness. In order to do so, find the chains hidden behind the stone torches on either side.  Pulling both chains will put out the flames, creating darkness. This will cause a hidden passage to open from behind the statue, leading to a corridor and your fourth test.  The Fourth Test[edit] ""Direct and yet indirect. The path to salvation a route of cunning with fortune betraying the foolish."" The two paths in the room of the fourth test The corridor that lies ahead has a path leading directly through to a door. However, this path contains multiple traps, including two pressure plates (which both trigger darts to be released from the ceiling) and a pendulum trap. If you choose to brave the pendulum trap, beware: at the end there is another pressure plate to the right which triggers a spear trap from multiple sides of the room. Opening the door ahead releases a battering ram from behind the door. You can also choose to avoid that path by going through a master-locked door (easily opened with use of the Skeleton Key), which is located to the left side just before the pendulum trap. This path leads to a small chamber which has two Nightingale Sentinels guarding the area. This area also contains a copy of the Lockpicking skill book Proper Lock Design (on the table near the southeast corner of the room), some gold, several bottles of poison, and other minor loot. A copy of the Sneak skill book Sacred Witness may be on the table near the altar on the northwest side (see bugs). You may now continue through the corridors until you reach the door leading into the Twilight Sepulcher Inner Sanctum. The Final Test[edit] ""The journey is complete, the Empress's embrace awaits the fallen. Hesitate not if you wish to gift her your eternal devotion."" Returning the Skeleton Key to its rightful place Proceed unopposed down a hallway and through a second set of doors, opening into a room with a well. It is advisable to save before jumping in due to a large number of potential bugs. You may suffer a small amount of health damage from the fall. Examine the skeletal remains of Anders, the thief who is mentioned in Nystrom's journal. A cutscene is triggered shortly afterwards, and the floor of the well descends to reveal a room with three closed doors and a lock at your feet (which requires the Skeleton Key). Use the key to re-open the Ebonmere. Nocturnal will then emerge from the Ebonmere. Nocturnal emerging from the Ebonmere Nocturnal: ""My, my. What do we have here? It's been a number of years since I've set foot on your world. Or perhaps it's been moments. One tends to lose track. So... once again the Key has been stolen and a ""champion"" returns it to the Sepulcher. Now that Ebonmere has been restored, you stand before me awaiting your accolades; a pat on your head... a kiss on your cheek. What you fail to realize is your actions were expected and represent nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement. Don't mistake my tone for displeasure, after all, you've obediently performed your duties to the letter. But we both know this has little to do with honor and oaths and loyalty. It's about the reward; the prize. Fear not. You'll have your trinkets, your desire for power, your hunger for wealth. I bid you to drink deeply from the Ebonmere, mortal. For this is where the Agent of Nocturnal is born. The Oath has been struck, the die has been cast and your fate awaits you in the Evergloam. Farewell, Nightingale. See to it the Key stays this time, won't you?"" You are now directed to speak with Karliah, who has appeared inside the Sepulcher. ""I'm glad you were able to bring the Key back safely. Nocturnal seemed quite pleased with your efforts."" ""Pleased? She sounded indifferent."": ""I wouldn't take that to heart. It's her way. Think of her as a scolding mother continually pushing you harder to be successful; outwardly sounding angry but silently content. I assure you, had she been displeased with you, we wouldn't be having this conversation."" ""What's this about becoming an Agent of Nocturnal?"": ""The circles at the base of the Ebonmere imbue you with powers befitting a Nightingale Agent. The crescent moon represents the Agent of Shadow, the half moon for the Agent of Subterfuge and the full moon for the Agent of Strife."" Now you are able to select either of the three Agents of Nocturnal: Agent of Shadow (Crescent Moon) - Use this power to be invisible for 2 minutes while sneaking. ""The Agent of Stealth is the master of remaining unseen. They are able to manipulate the darkness and use it to their advantage. On moonlit nights or in darkened rooms, this agent literally becomes invisible."" Agent of Subterfuge (Half Moon) - Use this power to cause all nearby enemies to fight each other for 30 seconds. ""The Agent of Subterfuge utilizes shadow to cloud the judgement of those around him.  By weaving the darkness to their will, this agent can manipulate others into fighting for the Nightingale for a limited time."" Agent of Strife (Full Moon) - Use this power to invoke a powerful life-drain effect. ""This [sic] Agent of Strife can send forth a tendril of pure darkness into the heart of another, causing great injury to them.  At the same time, this tether will bolster the agent's own life force, making him stronger."""" If you ask Karliah why you cannot be all three Agents at once, she will respond with ""This is Nocturnal's way of maintaining balance. If you ever feel the need to change your abilities, you can return to the Sepulcher and step onto a different circle. Be warned that once you've chosen, you can't reselect for at least a day."" ""So what now?"" ""Now, your life as a Nightingale begins. Should the need arise, you'll be summoned to the Sepulcher in order to defend it."" ""And you?"" ""The Guild has welcomed me back with open arms. I feel like a void in my life has finally been filled. I only hope that this isn't an ending to things, but actually the beginning."" ""The beginning of what?"" ""Why, perhaps the greatest crime spree Skyrim's ever known. There are pockets brimming with coin and coffers overflowing with riches ripe for the picking. We may be Nightingales, but in our hearts we're still thieves and we're damn good at what we do."" You can now return to the Nightingale Hall and use it as a home if you wish. Karliah will also reside there. Before you leave the Twilight Sepulcher however, there is a short cutscene where Gallus appears and speaks to Karliah before entering the Evergloam. Karliah's final farewell to Gallus Gallus: ""Karliah?"" Karliah: ""Gallus! I feared I would never see you again. I was afraid you'd become like the others."" Gallus: ""If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would have come true. He/She honors us all."" Karliah: ""What will you do now, my love?"" Gallus: ""Nocturnal calls me to the Evergloam. My contract has been fulfilled."" Karliah: ""Will I ever see you again?"" Gallus: ""When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid, we'll embrace once again."" Karliah: ""Farewell, Gallus. Eyes open... walk with the shadows."" Gallus: ""Goodbye, Karliah."" Approaching Karliah again and asking where Gallus went, she will respond by saying: ""Gallus's Oath has been paid. His actions have satisfied the terms. Now his spirit becomes one with the Evergloam... the realm of perpetual twilight and the cradle of shadow."" ""So, he's gone?"" ""No, not gone... he's become one with the shadows. This is the greatest honor a Nightingale can possibly achieve. In death, he's become a part of that which we use to live.""  ""They're a part of the darkness around us?"" ""Absolutely. When we say ""walk with the shadows,"" we are asking those Nightingales who have passed on to protect us. It's believed that they are literally what guides our uncanny luck... by placing their hands in ours. That's why the Ebonmere needed to be reopened. Without it, there's no way Nocturnal was able to allow them through."" ""How will I know if I'm needed here?"" ""If this place is in danger ever again, the shadows will call. Should the need arise, a portal connects the Sepulcher and Nightingale Hall. Use it whenever you wish."" To exit the Sepulcher, you can enter any of the three portals surrounding the Ebonmere. The portals will take you directly to the entrance of the Sepulcher, and if you look back, you will notice that the path that once led to the Pilgrim's Path now has a portal which will take you directly to the Inner Sanctum. Returning Home[edit] Once you've returned to the Thieves Guild, Brynjolf will greet you by remarking, ""It's good to see you in one piece lad/lass!"" He will then go on to say: ""I just wanted to give you a proper thank you for everything you've done. The Guild is back on its feet again and on its way to a prosperous future."" He will also ask about the Skeleton Key. When you say that you've returned it back to the Sepulcher, Brynjolf will reply: ""That's it then. After all of those years of helplessly watching the Guild decline. But enough of that... I'm confident that with you in charge, we'll soon have more gold than we could possibly spend."" Asking where he will be from now on will cause him to say: ""I'll be down here, trying to coordinate everything with Delvin and Vex; to make sure the coin keeps flowing... and no one skims! If you still feel like doing some jobs, I'm sure Delvin and Vex have more than their fair share to give out. Either way, it's been a pleasure, my friend. Here's to the future of the Guild. May it last another thousand years!"" If you have already completed the reputation quests, then you can now complete Under New Management, the last main quest available for the Thieves Guild. However, you are still able to complete jobs given by either Delvin or Vex."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dawnguard_(quest)","(Optional) Meet with Durak. Hear about the Dawnguard vampire hunters. Locate Fort Dawnguard. Speak to Isran and Vigilant Tolan.","Hear About the Vampire Hunters[edit] The destroyed Hall of the Vigilant Upon installing the Dawnguard add-on, you may hear a new rumor from city guards regarding the Dawnguard: ""Heard they're reforming the Dawnguard. Vampire hunters or something, in the old fort near Riften. Might consider joining up myself."" If this is the first you've heard of the Dawnguard, your map will be updated with the location of Fort Dawnguard, and the quest will officially appear in your journal. If your level is 10 or above, whether you've heard this rumor or not, an Orc named Durak will find and approach you with a proposal to join the Dawnguard: ""You there. The Dawnguard is looking for anyone willing to fight against the growing vampire menace. What do you say?"" The miscellaneous journal objective ""Find out about the Dawnguard"" will appear, and if you ask him to explain, he'll tell you that they are a group of vampire hunters. He'll mention that the Hall of the Vigilants was destroyed by vampires because the Vigilants didn't take the vampire threat seriously. If you ask him what he's talking about, he'll tell you they got torn to pieces when they went up against the vampires, and that's why his leader Isran is reestablishing the Dawnguard. When you ask how to sign up, Durak will tell you to talk to Isran at Fort Dawnguard, southeast of Riften. If you didn't hear the rumor from a guard already, your map will now be updated, and the quest will officially appear in your journal. If you happen to tell Durak you're not interested in being recruited, he'll say ""That's what everybody says, right up until they find their throat being ripped out by a pack of hungry vampires."" and the conversation will end. If you approach him a second time, he'll respond ""Yeah, you change your mind? The Dawnguard could use somebody like you."" and the other dialogue options are the same as the first time around. If you tell him you're not interested this time, he'll tell you to talk to Isran and give you the location of Fort Dawnguard anyway, in case you change your mind. Alternatively, you may start this quest in another manner, detailed below. Find Fort Dawnguard[edit] Fort Dawnguard Take the road that leads east from Riften. Right after the road turns southeast and you cross a small bridge, start watching the cliffs to your left. You'll find a small crack in the side of a cliff—the entrance to Dayspring Canyon. It's found between a hollow green log and a broken birch tree. A narrow, winding path leads you towards Fort Dawnguard. It is the only way to reach the fort until you discover the map marker. Along the way, you may catch up to Agmaer, another new recruit to the Dawnguard. If you haven't yet heard about the Dawnguard, his greeting will trigger the quest to appear in your journal: ""Oh, hey there! You here to join the Dawnguard, too?"" He expresses his anxiety concerning entering the fort on his own, and accompanies you the remainder of the way. He asks you not to mention his nervousness to Isran, but will make several comments expressing his low self-confidence as you make the walk. Despite his expressed fear of going in on his own, he will run inside the fort without waiting for you if you don't enter immediately after reaching the front steps to the entrance. You may pass Durak just outside the fort, practicing his skill with a crossbow. If you ask him what he's using, he'll answer ""Never seen a crossbow before? Not surprised. Kind of a Dawnguard specialty. Nothing better for putting down vampires."" He will then give you your own crossbow, along with 45 steel bolts (see notes below for how to get a second one). When you reach the steps to the fort, you'll find Celann guarding the entrance. If you choose to speak with him, he'll say he was surprised to hear from Isran at all, and comment that things must be pretty bad for Isran to request his help. If you ask Celann about working with Isran in the past, he'll tell you they were both members of the Vigilants of Stendarr, whose ""hearts were in the right place"" but left them both dissatisfied. The pair left together, but Celann didn't agree with Isran's ""methods"", so the partnership didn't last. On that note, he'll tell you ""Go on inside, Isran will want to talk to you."" Join the Dawnguard[edit] Isran and Tolan discussing the vampire attacks ""You need to concentrate, boy. Try it again."" Once inside, you'll find the Dawnguard leader, Isran, speaking to Tolan, a priest of the Vigilant. Isran: ""Why are you here, Tolan? The Vigilants and I were finished long ago."" Tolan: ""You know why I'm here, the Vigilants are under attack everywhere. The vampires are much more dangerous than we believed."" Isran: ""And now you want to come running to safety with the Dawnguard, is that it? I remember Keeper Carcette telling me repeatedly that Dawnguard is a crumbling ruin, not worth the expense and manpower to repair. And now that you've stirred up the vampires against you, you come begging for my protection?"" Tolan: ""Isran, Carcette is dead. The Hall of Vigilants... everyone... they're all dead. You were right, we were wrong. Isn't that enough for you?"" Isran: ""Yes, well... I never wanted any of this to happen. I tried to warn all of you... I am sorry, you know."" At this point, Isran will turn to you, asking ""So who are you, what do you want?"" You can tell him you're just looking around and ask about the fort, to which he'll reply, ""Why do I even post guards? This is the headquarters of the Dawnguard. Well, it used to be, a long time ago."" If you tell him you've come to join the Dawnguard, or simply that you've heard about the vampire hunters, he'll be pleased that you're interested but comment that most of their work at the moment is going toward restoring the fort. If you are already a fully transformed into a vampire when engaging for the first time in the conversation with Isran and you respond, ""I heard you were looking for vampire hunters"" Isran will reply ""You heard right, I'm glad the word is finally starting to get around. But that means it won't be long until vampires start to take notice as well."" If you reply, ""What exactly are you planning to do to these vampires?"" then Isran responds, ""First thing is to get this Fort back into shape. Right now a vampire could practically walk right into the front door. But I have something for you to do since you're asking"" and he goes on to talk about Dimhollow Crypt. When you ask how you can help, he'll respond ""I need someone out in the field, taking the fight to the damn vampires, while we're getting the fort back into shape. Tolan was telling me about a cave some of the Vigilants were poking around in. Seemed to think it was..."" and ask Tolan to tell you about Dimhollow Crypt. Tolan will inform you that ""Brother Adalvald was sure it held some long-lost vampire artifact of some kind. We didn't listen to him anymore than we did Isran. He was at the hall when it was attacked..."" Isran will then assign your first task to you: ""Go see what the vampires were looking for in this Dimhollow Crypt. With any luck, they'll still be there."" and then invite you to explore and take anything you need from Fort Dawnguard. Before you leave, Tolan will offer to meet you at Dimhollow Crypt, saying ""It's the least I can do to avenge my fallen comrades."" Isran and Tolan will argue a bit, as Isran doesn't believe the Vigilants are trained for such a mission, and Tolan is offended at the implication that Isran thinks the Vigilants are soft, cowardly, and weak. He will stand by his decision, though, telling you ""I'm going to Dimhollow Crypt. Perhaps I can be of some small assistance to you."" Isran will then give you a crossbow and some steel bolts (if you haven't received them from Durak already), saying ""Here, you should take a crossbow. Good for hunting out those fiends before they get too close."" and send you off on your mission. The quest Awakening begins immediately."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Death_Incarnate","Enter the Sanctuary. Assist the survivors. Hide in the Night Mother's coffin. Kill the traitor. Return to the Night Mother.","Welcome Home[edit] The Sanctuary is under attack! There should be several guards outside the sanctuary when you approach it, along with the horses and carriages that they arrived in. Deal with them and head inside the sanctuary. Festus Krex can be found dead outside, pinned against a tree by arrows. There are also several stacks of barrels holding oil, hinting at the way the Penitus Oculatus plans on destroying the sanctuary. When you enter the Sanctuary, you will notice the entire place is on fire and structurally unsound. Close to the entrance, you will overhear two members of Penitus Oculatus discussing who among the Dark Brotherhood turned traitor. Next to them you will find the body of Veezara. After their conversation, they will head towards you. Deal with them as you see fit. Astrid's and Arnbjorn's rooms are empty, so head down the stairs into the central room of the sanctuary. You will find Arnbjorn in his werewolf form fighting Penitus Oculatus agents. You can try to help him, but his death is scripted and he will die even if you kill the agents around him. There is no way for you to save him. The corpse of Gabriella lies in the next room, as does Lis.  The Burning Brotherhood[edit] Arnbjorn goes wild as a werewolf Continue through the sanctuary, avoiding the flames until you find Nazir. When you find him, he is locked in a duel with one of the agents, Arcturus. Assist him by killing his attacker and talk to him. His concerns that you might be the traitor are erased when you save him. Follow him in his search for an escape. As you follow him while he searches for a way out, you should run past the room with the Night Mother. She will call out to you, telling you the only safe place is in her coffin. Make sure Nazir is out of combat, then run and open the Night Mother's coffin. Walk into it, and it will close around you. In the darkness of the coffin you will hear explosions and sounds of the sanctuary coming down around you. After they end, you will hear the voices of Nazir and Babette talking as Nazir tries to unearth you. When Nazir opens the coffin, you find yourself in the main room of the sanctuary. Apparently, in the explosions, the coffin was thrown through the stained glass window. After you step out of the coffin and talk to the two survivors, the Night Mother will talk to you once again and inform you that Astrid is still alive. She will ask you to find her. Nazir and Babette will follow you after you inform them of what you've just heard. Burned Beyond Recognition[edit] The Night Mother tells you to go find Astrid Take the stairs up to Astrid's old chambers and you will see a horrifically burned Astrid stretched out on the floor in her hidden chamber with candles surrounding her. She has performed the Black Sacrament, prayed to the Night Mother and placed herself in the center of the ritual with the Blade of Woe (her symbol of status) beside her. Astrid reveals that she is the traitor. She betrayed you because she wanted things to go back to normal with the Dark Brotherhood. She was skeptical of Cicero and the Night Mother and envious of you for being named the Listener. With her last moments, burned and dying, she performed the Black Sacrament on herself and asked for a contract. When you arrived, her skepticism of the Night Mother disappeared, since she knows that her prayers were heard. She reveals that what she prayed for was a mercy killing. She wants to be put out of her misery. You can retrieve the Blade of Woe found next to the dying Astrid, as an optional step. Once you kill Astrid, she will thank you with her dying breath and the quest will update and direct you to return to the Night Mother (in her coffin). Nazir and Babette will comment on her death with anger and pity for their former leader. Once you return, the Night Mother will talk to you, instructing you to fulfill the Brotherhood's contract to kill the Emperor. She suggests talking to Amaund Motierre in Whiterun, but to let Nazir know of your plans first. Hence begins the next quest, Hail Sithis!."

Locate the four ancient chests containing the pieces of Deathbrand armor. Explore Gyldenhul Barrow. Defeat Haknir Death-Brand and his crew.","Tale of Treasure[edit] Haknir Death-Brand was known for rages and fits of madness, and he delighted in torture and murder for its own sake. He was said to have lived an unnaturally long life, and displayed a terrible scar on his face known as ""the Deathbrand"", which no man could look upon without flinching. Due to the terrible scar, some thought of him as a Daedra while others spoke of a pact he made with Mehrunes Dagon, calling the scar a seal between him and the Prince of Destruction. Before his death, he told his crew that none were worthy to be his successor or have his treasure. He placed a curse on his armor and his scimitars, Bloodscythe and Soulrender. He commanded a crewman to bury his armor in four separate locations on Solstheim, each marked by a map, before sealing him in his tomb at Gyldenhul Barrow along with all his treasure. This story was written down by a House Redoran scribe and ended up as the book Deathbrand. Once you have reached level 36, reading the book will start the miscellaneous objective to find Haknir's treasure. There are a total of eleven copies of the book on Solstheim. Please see this section for a complete list of locations. It is also possible to initiate the quest by asking about the latest rumors from Geldis Sadri at the Retching Netch, who will mark the site on your map upon inquiring. ""Boss said to bring you back or bring back your corpse."" Additionally, you may overhear an argument in the wilderness between a female pirate and a male pirate mage: Pirate: ""I told him 'no' once already."" Pirate Mage: ""We've got work to do."" Pirate: ""I'm not chasing that map. It's a fool's errand. I'm done. Leave me alone."" Pirate Mage: ""Boss said to bring you back or bring back your corpse."" Pirate: ""Is that so? Well, you'll never get that treasure now!"" Pirate Mage: ""Time to die!"" After their argument, they will attack each other over the discussed treasure. If you stand aside during their fight, the pirate may lose the battle, and you can loot a copy of the book from her corpse. The Silent Scream[edit] According to the book, Garuk Windrime and the rest of the crew arrived on a shoal in northern Solstheim, where they started digging the hole for the first of the four iron-bound chests. The same night, Garuk's heart was filled with greed; he opened the chest, took out the helm within and placed it on his head... and then began to scream. Although it remains unclear what happened to Garuk, it is said that his scream can still be heard on that same shoal, on moonlit nights. ""I told you. Just where the map said it would be."" After reading the book, a map marker will point you towards Haknir's Shoal, a small campsite along the coast in northeastern Solstheim. Travel to the camp and you will find it inhabited by pirates and their captain. If you manage to sneak up on the camp, you can overhear their conversation: Pirate: ""See? I told you. Just where the map said it would be."" Captain: ""We don't even know what's inside. And besides, there's... the curse."" Pirate: ""Don't tell me you believe that rot! Well, as soon as Jorn gets back, you'll see. You'll see."" From here, it is possible to kill the pirate captain and his followers or simply pickpocket the captain and steal the Deathbrand Treasure Map he is carrying. Once you have obtained the treasure map, the quest will initiate. Search the camp for the half-buried ancient chest and pick the expert-leveled lock. Inside, you will find the Deathbrand Helm, the same helm worn by Garuk Windrime, although the rumors of his scream on moonlit nights turn out to be highly exaggerated. The Treasure Hunt[edit] With one of the four chests found, three remain. Take a good look at the treasure map, and it becomes clear that Haknir's crew followed orders and placed them as far apart as possible. Note that you will have no map markers and will receive no quest updates until you have claimed the contents of all four chests.   Quick Access to Treasure Map →   Tel Mithryn (Southeast)[edit] Travel to the home of Telvanni wizard Neloth and find the river west of the settlement. Where the river flows into the Sea of Ghosts, a family of netch floats around. To the northeast of the netch family are several boulders in a pile, and three ash spawn will attack as you get close. Search the area for the ancient chest (screenshot) and notice that two treasure hunters beat you to it, but paid with their lives. Pick the expert-leveled lock on the chest and claim the Deathbrand Boots.  Raven Rock (Southwest)[edit]  ""We... we actually found it!"" Southwest of Raven Rock is the Earth Stone. Head to the stone and proceed in a north-northwestern direction until you reach a small pine forest, with a family of netch floating around above the water nearby. As you get closer, you will see a reaver and a reaver lord discussing the chest they just dug up:  Reaver: ""I can't believe it. We... we actually found it!"" Reaver Lord: ""Well, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and open it."" Reaver: ""No, no, I couldn't. ...You open it."" Reaver Lord: ""Maybe... we should think about this some more."" When they discover you, they will obviously be hostile. Deal with them both and locate the ancient chest (screenshot), pick the adept-leveled lock and claim the Deathbrand Armor.  Bristleback Cave (Northwest)[edit] The hidden dock, Northshore Landing, is located at the foot of the icy mountains of northwestern Solstheim. A small ways southwest of the dock is a small camp inhabited by rieklings guarding the entrance to Bristleback Cave. Proceed south along the shore and you will find a tidal pool with some mud crabs and the ancient chest (screenshot). Pick the adept-leveled lock on the chest and claim the Deathbrand Gauntlets. A Cursed Trove[edit] In whichever Deathbrand Armor chest (above) you open last, you will find the Gyldenhul Barrow Key, and the quest will update. The map marker will now point you towards the Nordic ruin, Gyldenhul Barrow. 80 piles of gold The King of Ghosts Gyldenhul Barrow is located on Horker Island, east of Skaal Village. It is guarded by a few patrolling reavers. There is a Quicksilver Ore Vein slightly to the northeast of the entrance. The door has a master-level lock on it, but the key you found will open it. Inside, you will find a dead Adventurer carrying a note detailing how his search for treasure ended in the small barrow. He had to barricade himself inside, waiting for a group of bandits to disappear from outside the ruin. In the meantime, he noticed a small draft from behind one of the two stalhrim deposits, although his pickaxe was unable to break them down. Approach the western stalhrim deposit and use your ancient Nordic pickaxe to tear it down. Behind it is a narrow tunnel leading further into the ruin. Unlock the door and enter a wide tunnel filled to the brink with piles of gold—a total of 80 piles, each worth between 80 and 120 gold, along with several pieces of jewelry, chests, and other valuables. However, as you start to loot the place, a portcullis will fall behind you, so the only way is onward. When you have claimed the huge treasure from the room, proceed to the southern door and unlock it with the key. Head down the tunnel until you reach a large chamber with the skeletal remains of Haknir Death-Brand. Next to the skeleton lies the legendary scimitar Bloodscythe. Once you claim it, Haknir Death-Brand's ghost will appear and attack you, then teleport away after he loses about 20% health. Members of his crew appear to fight you, including Garuk Windrime and Thalin Ebonhand. As you kill some of them off, Haknir Death-Brand will spawn again, and the cycle will repeat until he is dead. Once defeated you'll attain another unique scimitar named Soulrender. It has an added effect when dual-wielded with Bloodscythe. Also when Haknir falls, the way back out will re-open."

Make your decision: Persuade Vantus Loreius to fix the wheel. Turn in Cicero to the wandering guard.","Stranded Jester[edit] The Stranded Jester On the road north of Whiterun and near Loreius Farm, you will encounter a very odd jester named Cicero. He claims that he is from Cyrodiil and is moving to Skyrim. His wagon, which he says contains the remains of his mother, has broken down by the roadside. He asked Vantus Loreius, the owner of the nearby farm, to help him fix his wheel but Loreius refused. Cicero will ask you to convince Loreius to help him so he can move on. Speaking to Vantus Loreius will reveal that he was unwilling to help because of Cicero's odd behavior, and he speculates that Cicero's box likely contains Skooma or other illegal cargo, and doesn't want to chance aiding him in any illicit activity. Vantus asks that you convince a patrolling guard—either a Roadside Guard or Pale Hold Guard—to arrest Cicero. Helping Cicero[edit] To help Cicero, you must pass a very easy level Speech check to persuade Vantus to do the right thing and fix the wagon wheel.  Vantus will reconsider and promise to help Cicero on his way. After you notify Cicero, he will thank you and give you a certain amount of gold depending on your current level. Turning in Cicero[edit] To turn in Cicero, you need to find the guard that patrols the roadway near the farm. He patrols very close to the wagon and is frequently within sight of the wagon. The guard will place Cicero under arrest. Cicero promises to make Loreius pay and chastises you for not being of assistance. After notifying Vantus, he thanks you for bringing him peace and gives you gold. Consequences[edit] ""So many knife wounds."" Cicero is an assassin and the Keeper of the Dark Brotherhood. The coffin he is transporting contains the remains of the Night Mother. Choosing to help Cicero will lead to him showing gratitude if you join the Brotherhood. If you turn him in and later return to the farm, you'll find that Vantus Loreius and his wife, Curwe, have been slaughtered (although if you wait too long the bodies will be gone). A passing guard will remark ""You don't want to go up there, citizen. It's a terrible sight. The farmer and his wife murdered in the middle of the night. So many knife wounds."" If you later join the Dark Brotherhood, Cicero will be slightly upset with you for not helping him. Whichever attitude he shows toward you will carry no practical implications if you join the Brotherhood.

Inform them that you killed the Dark Brotherhood's leader, and you will be directed to speak to Commander Maro in Dragon Bridge southwest of Solitude. He can be found in the Penitus Oculatus Outpost. After speaking to Commander Maro, you will be given the passphrase (""Silence, my brother"") to their hideout and directed to kill everyone inside. He says that you should ""have the honor"" of clearing out the place, meaning you'll be going in alone. Even your followers do not enter the sanctuary with you. However, spectral entities such as Arniel's spirit and the ghostly Dragon Priest (summoned by the Konahrik mask) will enter with you, and they'll assist you in the assault. The task should be relatively simple, as this quest will have them spread out between each room (as opposed to them being gathered and chatting when you first enter as an actual member). Babette, Cicero, and the Night Mother won't be in the sanctuary during the attack. You don't need to kill the frostbite spider Lis, but it will become hostile if it sees you. Loot what you please.

Destroying the Dark Brotherhood makes a number of rewards unavailable, namely Shadowmere, a minimum of 20,000 gold, the Summon Spectral Assassin power, access to the Dawnstar Sanctuary, the ability to marry Muiri, the never-dying Dark Brotherhood Initiate followers, the Master trainers for Alchemy and Light Armor, Ancient Shrouded Armor, Windshear, and Cicero's outfit and offer of being a follower."

Obtain the key to the trapdoor and escape.","Diplomatic Immunity[edit] The Thalmor[edit] Malborn inside the Winking Skeever Travel to Riverwood. If you choose to travel with Delphine, and come close to her, she will stop and explain the complex background story about the Blades and how the Aldmeri Dominion wiped out all Blades during the Great War. While her memory of past events seems checkered at best, she at least provides some background information behind her hatred towards the Thalmor and a valid reason on why she suspects them for being responsible for the dragon attacks. Due to a travel bug, it is best to chat with Delphine at the beginning of her trip, then stop by the Braidwood Inn and rest, giving her time to travel alone. She has no special commentary at waypoints in this direction. Delphine will appear at The Bannered Mare in Whiterun and fuss at the Dragonborn for not meeting her in Riverwood. Once back in the Sleeping Giant Inn, she will head down to the secret basement and reveal that she has a plan. Delphine's dialogue Delphine: ""I figured out how we're going to get you into the Thalmor Embassy.""  You're not coming? That didn't take long. Why not just fight our way in? Thalmor Ambassador Elenwen often throws parties for the upper-class citizens of Skyrim. You are to meet a ""man on the inside"", Malborn, who will help you to the best of his abilities. He will meet you at the Winking Skeever in Solitude. In the meantime, Delphine will work on getting you a formal invitation to the party. Travel to Solitude and see Malborn. The Wood Elf[edit] According to Delphine, the Thalmor killed Malborn's entire family back in Valenwood, giving him plenty of good reason to help you out. You will find him inside the Winking Skeever, trying to keep a low profile. He will be quite surprised that she picked you for such a dangerous infiltration job, but will explain the situation. You are to carefully choose some equipment that he can smuggle into the embassy, preferably stealth-based, and he advises you not to try to bring anything yourself. When you're ready, hand him your preferred equipment. Don't forget to give him lockpicks if you want to access locked containers in the Embassy. After you close the menu, he will get up and leave. Delphine will now be waiting for you at Solitude Stables, just southwest of Solitude. Once you arrive, she will ensure that everything went smoothly with Malborn and will then hand you an official invitation along with a set of party clothes and boots to look the part. After you have changed she will take your remaining equipment and you will automatically board the carriage to the Thalmor Embassy. High-Class Party[edit] The Thalmor Embassy ""I am Elenwen, the Thalmor Ambassador to Skyrim."" The carriage driver will drop you off in the courtyard of the embassy and you will be greeted by the drunken ramblings of a Redguard named Razelan, apparently a high-ranking officer in the East Empire Company. As you approach the entrance, a Thalmor Soldier will ask for your invitation, so show it and go inside. Once you enter, party host Elenwen will be quick to seek you out and ask too many questions. Luckily, your friend Malborn is standing right behind her and will soon interrupt the embarrassing conversation and point Elenwen's attention elsewhere. Talk to Malborn, who will brief you; you are to create a scene so he can unlock the back door unnoticed. Look around the room and check out the guests. When asking around, you will quickly notice that the guests are either hateful Thalmor or high-ranked denizens of Skyrim who only participate in the party for personal benefit. With the exception of the hostess Elenwen, the drunken Razelan, the servant Brelas and the bard Illdi (or Grete if Illdi is dead ), the guests are often randomized or determined from your previous actions before even starting the quest. You can quickly create the distraction by talking to Erikur. Listen to his speech, then wait for him to harass Brelas. After he is finished, walk back to him and offer to talk to her in his stead. He will be very grateful. Regardless of what you say to Brelas, when you return to Erikur tell him, ""Yes. She said she can sneak you up to her quarters right now"". He will then immediately go to her and begin to accost her, drawing the attention of the guards. Quickly return to Malborn and proceed to the kitchen. There are no persuasion checks required for this and his disposition towards you does not affect the dialogue.  Brelas will later end up in a dungeon cell, but can be liberated. Alternatively, giving a bottle of Cyrodilic Brandy (which you can obtain from Malborn) to Razelan, whom you previously met outside, will make him inclined to create a disruption on your behalf if you request it of him.   Party Conversations In this randomly determined conversation, Elenwen will politely ask the guests if they're liking the party. Depending if they're happy or not, their answer will vary:    Order  Speaker  Line   #1  Elenwen  ""Are you enjoying the party?""   ""Is the food and drink to your liking?""   ""Is my staff seeing to your needs?""   #2  (in the faction MQ201PartyGuestHappy)Orthus EndarioProventus AvenicciSiddgeirMaven Black-BriarErikur Elisif the Fair  ""Everything is splendid, thank you.""

""I have no complaints.""   ""I suppose so, yes.""   #3  Elenwen  ""Splendid. Call if you have need of me.""   ""It pleases me to hear you say so.""   ""Excellent. I'll leave you to it, then.""  The Jarls aligned with the Empire may also talk about problems running their hold due to recent events. They can either be Idgrod Ravencrone, Balgruuf the Greater, Siddgeir, Igmund, or Elisif the Fair. Again, they will choose between random lines:    Speaker  Line   Jarl#1  ""We've got our hands full dealing with the Stormcloaks. What about you?""   ""Are the dragons frightening your people as much as they're frightening mine?""   ""Have you found it difficult to get provisions lately? I can scarcely feed the staff in my palace.""   ""Between the dragons and the Stormcloaks, my coffers are running dry.""   Jarl#2  ""We've had the same troubles.""   ""I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.""   Jarl#1  ""With any luck, a worthy hero will step forward and solve our problems, just like in the tales of old.""   ""We must keep faith in ourselves and the Divines.""   ""These are troubling times, indeed.""  In yet another conversation, the party guests (except Ondolemar) will discuss current events:    Speaker  Line   Guest#1  ""I heard Elenwen say she's going open a bottle of her best Firebrand Wine later. I can hardly wait.""   ""These Stormcloaks are nothing more than an armed mob. This war won't last much longer.""   ""I hope they'll serve the roast venison with bittergreen sauce that we had at the last party. That was delicious.""   ""This war has taken a toll on the merchants of Skyrim. Let's hope that it ends soon, for their sake.""   ""I look forward to the day when this rebellion is put down, and we once again have peace.""   ""The Gray Quarter in Windhelm is little better than a slum. It's shameful that the dark elves are made to live that way.""   ""With the soldiers all fighting in the war, there's nobody to hunt down the bandits. Travel has become dangerous of late.""   ""It's been a brutal winter. I can't remember the last time it was this cold, and for this long.""   Guest#2  ""Yes, I agree with you. Have you heard any news from the other parts of Skyrim?""   ""You speak truly. Have you heard any interesting rumors of late?""   ""I'll not argue that. Heard any interesting gossip lately?""   ""I couldn't agree more. By the way, have you heard any interesting rumors lately?""   ""I couldn't have said it better myself. It's been some time since I've had news from elsewhere in Skyrim. What have you heard?""   ""I know just what you mean. Heard anything interesting lately? Any news or gossip?""   Guest#1  ""Well, I did hear that the Argonians have been banned from living inside the walls of Windhelm. They're only allowed on the city docks now. Most of them sleep together in one building, and they're as poor as wretches.""   ""Have you visited Rorikstead lately? No matter how harsh the winter, the crops that grow there never falter. Even when every other farm in the hold is barely scraping by, the harvest at Rorikstead is always bountiful. Is it good fortune? The blessings of the Divines? Who knows?""   ""Now that I think on it, I did hear something rather interesting the other day. Apparently, the Red Wave has been docked in Solitude for well over a month, and with no sign of shipping out any time soon. Some say the ship suffered damage to her hull when she struck an iceberg, and Captain Safia can't afford the repairs. Of course, she would never admit such a thing. Captain Safia is far too proud a woman for that.   ""Well, there might be nothing to it, but I've heard that the feud between the Gray-Manes and the Battle-Borns in Whiterun has grown ugly. Fralia Gray-Mane is convinced that the Battle-Borns have abducted one of her sons.""   ""I'm not sure that it's news, but lately it seems like every blacksmith in Skyrim is out to prove that he's the equal of Eorlund Gray-Mane. It's not really a fair comparison, if you ask me. After all, Eorlund works the Skyforge. How is any smith going to compete with that?""   ""Well, I did see something interesting not long ago. There were several Khajiit camped outside the walls of Whiterun. Seems they've been traveling around the whole of Skyrim peddling their wares. You've got to admire their courage, doing something like that with dragons on the loose and a war going on.""   ""I heard those mages up in Winterhold have been trying to figure out how many dragons there are in Skyrim. They seem to think it's at least a dozen, but I'm sure they're exaggerating. They're probably trying to scare us into giving them more money and influence, so they can save us from the dragons threat.""   ""Well, I did hear that Ulfric Stormcloak was slain while defending Windhelm against a dragon, but it sounds too good to be true. I'll wager it was Ulfric himself that started the rumor. Maybe he thought it would bolster recruitment."" (only heard if Ulfric is alive)   Ondelmar  ""The degeneracy of the Empire is on display here in this room.""   ""It's only a matter of time before your whole rotten Empire collapses of its own decay. No offense.""   ""None of these people cares a whit about the religious aspects of this war.

""It's a necessary part of my job to mix with the upper classes of Skyrim, such as they are.""

I just wanted to get a better look at you.  I like what I see, my dear.  And believe me, I don't say that to everyone.  I'm very discriminating when it comes to the female form. Brelas: Um, thank you.  Sir.  Was there anything else I can do for you? Erikur: Oh... not at the moment.  Maybe later.  Don't go far. Brelas: Yes, sir.  At this point, you need to speak to Brelas, and then either lie to Erikur or tell him the truth.   Lie Truth    Erikur: Hello, my dear.  I got your message.  Where shall we go? Brelas: What?  I'm sorry, sir, but you must have misunderstood.  I'm not permitted to leave the party. Erikur: Oh, I don't think so.  I think I understand perfectly.  Don't worry, my dear, I will make any necessary excuses to your employer.    Erikur: So you think you can toy with me, is that it?  No, my dear.  I have my heart set on you, and I always get what I want. Brelas: I'm sorry, sir.  I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression earlier.  I meant no disrespect. Erikur: Don't worry, I'll let you make it up to me.  Now, where can we go for a little privacy, hmm?   Brelas: No, I'm sorry, but I can't go anywhere with you.  I won't.  Please, I must get back to my duties. Erikur: Don't you dare walk away from me, you slut!  Do you know who I am? Brelas: Please, sir, leave me alone! Erikur: Now you're going to be sorry you crossed me.  Elenwen!  This servant girl has been throwing herself at me in a most disgusting manner. Elenwen: Is that so, Erikur?  And you with such delicate sensibilities.  It must have been most upsetting. Erikur: I demand that you have this wench removed from my presence at once! Elenwen: Well.  Whatever the truth of it, I'm sure a few words with Master Rulindil will have a salutary effect.  Take her downstairs. Brelas: No! Guard: Yes, Madame Ambassador. Brelas: Mistress Elenwen, it's not true!  I did nothing!  Sir, you must tell her!  You don't know what they'll do to me!  Please! Erikur: Well, I'm glad that little unpleasantness is over.  Brelas will be found in the torture room downstairs.  You can rescue her, after which she will move to the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm. ""Helping"" Erikur in this way befriends him, whether you lie to him or tell the truth, even if you rescue Brelas from her cell later.

Infiltration[edit] In the kitchen, the Khajiit cook Tsavani will complain about Malborn bringing a stranger into the kitchens, at least until Malborn reminds her of her secret Moon Sugar addiction. Malborn will then lead you into a room where you can receive the items you asked him to smuggle in. You should now be fully prepared for battle, and if not, then for stealth. If you are not, it is probably a good idea to re-open an earlier save and re-start the mission, as the Thalmor Wizards summon hostile Storm Atronachs, and you should be prepared enough to kill their mages or them. As soon as you exit through the door, Malborn will lock the kitchen area behind you and you are on your own, with the objective to find dragon-related intelligence. In the first hallway, you can eavesdrop on a conversation between two Thalmor Guards, hinting that Delphine may be wrong about the Thalmor: Guard #1: ""Did you see those robes march in this morning? Who're they with? More of the Emissary's treaty enforcers?"" Guard #2: ""No. They're high mages, just in from Alinor. I guess Herself is finally getting worried about all the dragon attacks."" Guard #1: ""Ah, good. I've been wondering how we were supposed to defend this place from a dragon."" Guard #2: ""If a dragon does show up, maybe we'll get lucky and it will eat the mages first. Might give us enough time to kill it."" Guard #1: ""Ha. I'd like to see those arrogant bastards taken down a notch. Always looking down their noses at us lowly footsloggers."" After a bit of mean-spirited laughter, one of the guards will say, ""Well, we'd better get back to our rounds."" and they will both return to their duties, unfortunately in the room you will have to pass through. Note that the full set of Thalmor clothes in the adjacent room was supposed to make you harder to detect, but due to a bug, the clothes don't work, as the desired effect was wrongfully set to the Hooded Thalmor Robes. You can claim a set of hooded robes from the Thalmor wizard in the upstairs area from the first room, but chances are he will detect you and call upon the two guards from downstairs. Regardless, you can choose between two  strategies; either take the stealthy approach, with or without the hooded robes, or go on a rampage and kill everybody. Hooded Thalmor Robes Method[edit] If you want to use the Hooded Thalmor Robes, as intended by the developers, either acquire some from the random Justiciars found in the wilderness, or aim to kill the wizard on the first floor. After you don the robes, you will be undercover if you're an elf, can walk past the guards (at a distance) if you are human, or will be immediately exposed if you are Khajiit or Argonian. Table   Race  Response   High Elf  ""Must be new around here.""   Wood Elf  ""Seems a bit short to me.""   Imperial/Nord/Redguard/Breton/Dark Elf/Orc  ""You there. I don't think I've seen you around before."" or ""Come here. Let me see your face."" or ""Haven't seen him/her around before."" or ""Must be new around here.""   Beast Race (Khajiit/Argonian)  ""Wait, is that a tail?""  If disguised as a Thalmor Wizard, you may dismiss the guard standing outside the Solar with a high enough speech check (if you cannot pass the speech check however, he'll notice that you're an intruder and everybody in the courtyard will turn hostile). Note that once you reach Elenwen's Solar, the patrolling guard, as well as Rulindil, are scripted to see through your disguise, regardless of race. This method is possible with a reasonably high Illusion skill (over 50) as other races by using Calm spells. It does not work for any other guards during this mission, and once you are inside the Solar, the guards will attack you on sight.  Speech check dialogue Thalmor Wizard: ""Why aren't you at your post, Justiciar?""  Emissary Elenwen was asking for you inside. (Persuade) Yes sir. Sorry sir. If the speech check is passed, he will respond: Thalmor Wizard: ""Why didn't you say so? Take over my post. Make sure nobody enters the Solar. Enter the Solar[edit] The first room contains the two talkative guards, with the Thalmor wizard patrolling the second floor. Right after their conversation ends, they will both turn their back to the door and return to their positions, giving you a chance to sneak upstairs and attempt to claim the robes by killing the wizard quietly. If not, you will have to take out the two guards and the wizard, and pick one of the two available doors leading to the outside courtyard. The area is patrolled by three Thalmor soldiers with another wizard standing guard near the front door to your target destination, the Solar of Elenwen. If you wear the hooded robes, the guards will not notice you, but the wizard cannot generally be avoided and will see through your disguise. To enter the Solar, you have a few options. The most straightforward is to fight them all. You can avoid the fight by using Calm, or by using Fury on one of the guards and then running in while they're busy with each other. Stealthy characters can fire arrows to distract the guards and pull the wizard away from the door. The door wizard occasionally looks to his left, leaving open an opportunity on his right for sneaking and invisible characters to get through the door before fully detected. Once the guards are dealt with and the way to the Solar is clear, enter sneak mode and head in. The Informant[edit] Once you get inside Elenwen's Solar, the true face of the Thalmor will start to show, although not in the way Delphine expected. When the door closes behind you, you should hide behind the plant in the southwestern corner and eavesdrop on the conversation between the Thalmor torturer Rulindil and his informant Gissur in the neighboring room. The conversation centers on a prisoner named Etienne and an unnamed old man: ""He knows where that old man is you're looking for..."" Gissur: ""But, I need that money! I earned it. I have my own expenses you know..."" Rulindil: ""Silence! Do not presume, Gissur. You are most useful, but do not presume. We have other informants who are less... offensive."" Gissur: ""But no one else has brought you such valuable information, have they? Etienne, he's talked, hasn't he? He knows where that old man is you're looking for, he told me himself."" Rulindil: ""You'll get the rest of your money when we confirm his story. As agreed."" Gissur: ""So he has talked! I knew it!"" Rulindil: ""Everyone talks, in the end. Now, I have work to do. Leave me to it, if you ever want to see the rest of your payment."" Gissur: ""Can I... I could help you. He'd talk to me. He trusts me."" Rulindil: ""You'd like to come downstairs with me, is that it, Gissur? Shall we loose his bonds and put you in a cell together? You can ask him anything you like, and see how he answers."" Gissur: ""No, no. I'll... I'll wait outside."" Rulindil: ""That would probably be best. Now get out!"" While an insulted Gissur obeys orders and leaves the building, Rulindil will head downstairs and enter the dungeon, leaving the patrolling soldier alone with you. You can either sneak past him or kill him, as your objective is the chest in the northwestern corner. Open the chest and obtain the interrogation chamber key, Thalmor dossiers on Delphine and Ulfric Stormcloak, and the revealing document Dragon Investigation: Current Status, which proves the Thalmor are investigating the dragon attacks as well, with Rulindil in charge of interrogating a suspect in the cells. Torture Session[edit] Go down the stairs and enter the dungeon, where you will arrive at a balcony overlooking a bloodstained torture room and a number of cells. If used as a distraction, Brelas will be there too. If he wasn't killed in the previous room, Rulindil will be seated at the desk, while a Thalmor Soldier will do the dirty work and torture Etienne Rarnis while Rulindil asks a series of questions: ""I don't know his name."" ""And where can we find this nameless old man?"" Etienne: ""Stop. Please. I don't know anything else. Don't you think I'd have told you already?"" Soldier: ""Silence. You know the rules. Do not speak unless spoken to. Master Rulindil will ask the questions."" Rulindil: ""Let's begin again."" Etienne: ""No... for pity's sake... I've already told you everything..."" Rulindil: ""You know the rules."" Etienne: ""Noooooo!!!"" Rulindil: ""Start at the beginning, as usual. If you persist in this stubbornness I'll have..."" Etienne: ""No, wait! I was just... catching my breath... why wouldn't I tell you again? I don't even know anything... There's an old man. He lives in Riften. He could be this Esbern you're looking for, but I don't know. He's old and seemed kind of crazy. That's all I know."" Rulindil: ""And his name is...?"" Etienne: ""I don't know his name. Like I've told already a hundred- Ahhhh!"" Rulindil: ""You know the rules. Just answer the questions. And where can we find this nameless old man?"" Etienne: ""Like I said, I don't know! I've seen him down in the Ratway. Maybe he lives down there, but I don't know for sure."" Rulindil: ""That will be all for now. I must say I continue to be disappointed in your lack of cooperation. I hope next time you will do better."" Etienne: ""What else do you want from me? I've already told you everything. Listen, if you let me go I can take you to Riften, show you where- Gaaaaah!!!"" Soldier: ""Silence, prisoner!"" Rulindil attacks. With that last punch, Etienne finally loses consciousness and the Thalmor will leave him alone. Rulindil will stay behind his desk while the Thalmor Soldier will start patrolling the area. Your objectives are in the chest right next to Rulindil and in the soldier's possession. Two more soldiers will enter as soon as you advance the quest. Also, if you've gotten Brelas in trouble, she is imprisoned nearby. You can rescue her too (this not recommended due to a bug). As such, the best way to proceed is to kill Rulindil and his accomplice. Rulindil is a powerful wizard with countless spells at his disposal. Depending on your skill set, you may choose head-on combat or stealth assassination. Sneaking up on them with a dagger is one option. Using a crossbow and two vials of Paralysis Poison is another. Rulindil carries a wide array of items, such as spell tomes, poisons, and enchanted jewelry. Be sure to collect them. Now is a good time to save the game, if you want Malborn to survive and give you an optional quest later on. Escape the Embassy[edit] Enter Etienne's cell and tell him that you are here to help. Cut him loose and ask him if he knows anything of importance; he will then tell you about Esbern and the quest will update. You can also ignore Etienne and look in the chest by the back wall to the right of his cell, which contains a book titled Thalmor Dossier: Esbern; if you read it, the quest will also update. When that happens, quickly run up the eastern set of stairs (or better read it there), where you will find Malborn, now exposed for his treachery, and two Thalmor Soldiers. They will kill him on the spot if you let them, so kill both of them quickly and don't hit Malborn. After the battle, search the corpses for the trap door key (or pickpocket the key without combat) and return to Etienne who will be waiting near the trap door, or just go to the trap door. This will also be your last chance to free Brelas if you involved her in your distraction by speaking to Erikur. You will now have up to three followers, completely unable to fight, but unlock the trap door and enter Reeking Cave. Down there, a troll resides, so run ahead of the fugitives and kill it before they even notice it (as they will try to fight it and get killed in the process). If you had a follower when you spoke to Delphine at the stables, he or she will probably enter the cave at this point from the other side, and help to kill the troll. You can also just run through because trying to kill a big troll with your weak followers in the way is really hard without getting them killed. Lastly, locate the tunnel with a dead conjurer, the Illusion skill book Before the Ages of Man and an Unusual Gem. Exiting the cave will start the unnamed miscellaneous quest with the objective Recover your equipment, then prepare to deliver some surprising news to Delphine back in Riverwood. In the secret basement underneath the Sleeping Giant Inn, Delphine will anxiously await your return. When you tell her that the Thalmor have nothing to do with the dragon attacks, she will be quite surprised and ask for elaboration. When you tell her that they're looking for someone named Esbern, she will be shocked: ""Esbern? He's alive? I thought the Thalmor must have got him years ago. That crazy old man... Figures the Thalmor would be on his trail, though, if they were trying to find out what's going on with the dragons."" It turns out Esbern is a former Blade, just like Delphine, and that it makes perfect sense for the Thalmor to blame him for the dragons. When you tell her about Esbern's supposed location in Riften, she will immediately task you with tracking him down before the Thalmor do. She will then give you a secret phrase to gain Esbern's trust, the Diplomatic Immunity quest will end, and the next quest, A Cornered Rat, will begin. Recover your equipment[edit] Remember to claim all your belongings from Delphine's chest before leaving for Riften to complete the miscellaneous quest. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: Diplomatic Immunity (20 points/Bronze)"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Discerning_the_Transmundane","Speak to Septimus Signus. Find the Elder Scroll in Blackreach. Fill the Blank Lexicon. Give the Lexicon to Septimus Signus. Harvest blood from a High Elf, Wood Elf, Dark Elf, Falmer, and Orc. Give the collected blood samples to Septimus Signus. Collect the Oghma Infinium.","Signus's Gesture[edit] Far north of Winterhold, there is a small cave called Septimus Signus's Outpost. Inside, a strange Dwemer cube is being studied by Septimus Signus. He claims the ""heart of a God,"" ""heart of you and me,"" is located inside. He asks you to help him see through the cube. To do so, he plans to use the power of an Elder Scroll. However, he does not possess the knowledge to use the Elder Scroll. To help him, you must travel to the Dwemer ruin Alftand and charge the Lexicon. He gives you two items: Attunement Sphere Blank Lexicon Alftand[edit] Be prepared: Alftand is an extensive Dwemer ruin occupied by Falmer and Dwemer constructs, including Centurions. Once there, travel through the ruin, following your destination marker, until you reach Blackreach, a massive underground cavern below Alftand. Alternatively, if you do not feel your level or equipment are sufficient to penetrate Alftand, it is actually unnecessary to do so; Mzinchaleft and Raldbthar both access Blackreach as long as the player has an Attunement Sphere, and both are faster and easier than Alftand. A more complete walkthrough can be found on the Alftand and Blackreach pages. At this point you will have access to a Dwemer lift for quick travel between Blackreach and the surface, in case you want to make a trip back to town before delving further underground. When you are ready, follow the quest marker through Blackreach until you reach your destination, The Tower of Mzark. Inside, you will find the Oculory, a large Dwemer machine that occupies the last room of the Tower. Go up the curving stairs along either wall to find a control panel with a stand that has a slot for the Lexicon. Place the Lexicon atop the stand to activate the machine's control panel. To decipher the code, press the second button from the right four times, pausing between each pressing to allow the Oculory to complete its realignment. This will cause the Lexicon to open and the third button from the right be revealed. Now press the third button twice, which will align the lenses such that they direct shafts of light onto the round, green windows of the Oculory, and also uncover the far left button. Finally, press the far left button once and watch as the Oculory reaches its correct alignment, revealing the Elder Scroll. Take the now-completed Runed Lexicon from the stand, then go to the center of the Oculory and retrieve the Elder Scroll from its cradle for the concurrent quest Elder Knowledge. Once you have both the Elder Scroll and the Lexicon, return to Septimus Signus at his outpost. Daedric Prince of the Unknown[edit] To continue past this point, you must be level 15 or higher. If you aren't level 15 yet, giving Septimus the Lexicon will result in him dismissing you; then, you must wait until a courier delivers a letter from him to continue. Once you have returned to the outpost, talk to Septimus again. He'll read the Lexicon and tell you he searched for it with the help of the Daedric Prince of Knowledge, Hermaeus Mora. He tells you to harvest the blood of the mer races in Tamriel. Head for the outside of the cave. You will see a Wretched Abyss that has the talk option. Talk to the abyss, and you will learn that the voice coming from the abyss is that of Hermaeus Mora. He claims that Septimus is a good follower, but after he discovers how to unlock the Dwemer box he will have outlived his usefulness. He will then tell you that you should take Septimus's place, which you can agree to or disagree. Neither choice will affect the outcome of the quest. Hermaeus Mora wishes for you to speak with him again after you have completed Septimus's task. Blood Harvest[edit] In order to harvest blood, you need to search the corpse of someone of the appropriate race while the Essence Extractor is in your inventory. The five races whose blood you need to harvest are Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Falmer, and Orsimer. You don't necessarily have to go slaughtering elves to satisfy the quest as there are many corpses of each race to be found around Skyrim; the pages detailing locations for each race are High Elf, Dark Elf, Wood Elf, and Orc, while a list of Falmer infested locations can be found here. There is also a list of dead bandits of all races to be considered. A select few locations are listed below as they contain the corpses of more than two races: Altmer, Bosmer, Falmer, and Orc bodies can be found in Alftand, although if you've followed the suggested route through Alftand to get to Blackreach, you'll need to return quickly or many of the bodies will have been cleared out. Bosmer, Dunmer, Falmer, and Orc bodies can be found in Liar's Retreat. Bosmer, Dunmer, and Orc bodies can be found in Rannveig's Fast. Bosmer, Dunmer, and Orc bodies can be found in Silverdrift Lair. Altmer are also part of the Thalmor and can be found at the Thalmor Embassy.

Give the blood samples to Septimus and wait for him to open the cube. Following him inside will reveal, much to the surprise of the delusional quest giver, that it was not the ""Heart of a God"" that was stored inside the cube, but rather a book. His surprise is cut short as his usefulness to Hermaeus Mora has been outlived and he is promptly disposed of in a flash of light. It is revealed that the book on a pedestal is actually the Oghma Infinium. Hermaeus Mora will greet you again, calling you his champion. You can reply with ""What now?"" or ""I am not your champion, monster."" Again, there are no consequences to the completion of this quest with either choice. Through conversation with the Daedric prince, you learn that it was sealed here for a reason, so that no more of its dangerous knowledge could be shared with the world of mortals—something that Hermaeus Mora wishes undone. At this point, the quest is complete. Reading the book will reveal some of the knowledge hidden within. Specifically, you can choose from three different paths: magic, shadow, or might, and receive +5 permanent points in the following skills, depending on the choice: The Path of Might: Archery, Block, Heavy Armor, One-handed, Smithing, Two-handed The Path of Shadow: Alchemy, Light Armor, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Sneak, Speech The Path of Magic: Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Enchanting, Illusion, Restoration"

Take the journal to Brand-Shei.","Brand-Shei is a Dark Elf trader in Riften. He can usually be found at his stall at the market, or in a cell in the Riften Jail if you've helped Brynjolf frame him for theft. As a Dunmer, he has an oddly Argonian name (such as Beem-Ja, Gulum-Ei, Talen-Jei). In fact, he was raised Argonian. ""I ended up orphaned then taken in by a kindly Argonian family in Black Marsh."" He hopes one day to find out what happened to him and he has got one clue. When he was found by his Argonian father, he was wrapped in a blanket bearing the symbol of House Telvanni, one of the great houses in Morrowind long ago. He'd like you to keep an eye on anything that might provide him with the answers he is looking for in your travels. If you ask him why was he searching in Skyrim, he will tell you something about a matron who had served for House Telvanni and remind you to investigate a ship named ""The Pride of Tel Vos"". Travel to the northeast coast of Skyrim and you can find the wreck of The Pride of Tel Vos. A group of three bandits have a camp here. However, you can hide yourself from them easily. You can also choose to wipe them out and take their treasures. In the northern half of the ship at the waterline, you can find a waterlogged chest containing the item you need: Lymdrenn Tenvanni's Journal. This journal would be the key to the answers Brand-Shei is looking for. Return to Brand-Shei and give the book to him. He will be very excited. ""Yes... yes. This is it! I don't know how you found this stranger, but you've obviously succeeded where I had failed."" Then he will offer you the key to his strongbox under his stand in the marketplace. You are free to take anything inside, including some gems, potions, and a random novice level Destruction spell tome."

Return to Esbern.","This is a radiant quest and can be completed any number of times in a number of different locations. This quest only becomes available once the quests Alduin's Wall and Rebuilding the Blades are complete. If the quest Paarthurnax is active this quest cannot be received until it is completed. In Sky Haven Temple, talk to Esbern to see if he has discovered the location of a dragon's lair. If he has, he'll tell you that his research has uncovered a location, and will offer to send the Blades to meet you there. If you accept, the quest begins: a location is marked on the your map, and an entry is added to the Miscellaneous quests to ""Kill the Dragon in <location>"". Travel to the given location. The Blades recruited during Rebuilding the Blades will be waiting nearby. Once you arrive they will charge the lair, attacking the dragon. If you attack the dragon without having triggered the charge of the Blades, the attack will trigger the charge. Once the dragon is slain, the Blades will return to Sky Haven Temple, leaving you to loot the dragon and collect any nearby treasure. Return to Sky Haven Temple and tell Esbern the dragon is slain.

Report back to Jarl Balgruuf.","Irileth rallying the guards Talk to Jarl Balgruuf[edit] Shortly after you return the Dragonstone to Farengar, Irileth will approach to inform him that there has been a sighting of a dragon at Whiterun's Western Watchtower not far west of the city. Irileth will then ask Farengar and you to meet with Jarl Balgruuf. Follow them there, where a somewhat unnerved Whiterun guard will recount seeing a dragon flying over the watchtower. Balgruuf will ask you to accompany Irileth, as she goes to investigate and, if necessary, do battle. She will recruit several Whiterun Guards along the way. Meet Irileth near the Western Watchtower[edit] ""No! Get back! It's still here somewhere! Hroki and Tor just got grabbed when they tried to make a run for it!"" Follow Irileth to the Guard Barracks just inside the city gates. After she delivers a speech to rally her soldiers, follow them west towards the tower. You will gather near the road close to the watchtower to find the watchtower burned and smoking, evidently signs of a recent attack by a dragon. After a short talk, Irileth will give orders to search for survivors. On the north side of the tower, on or around the ramp leading to the interior, you will encounter the lone surviving Whiterun Guard, stammering about what he's just experienced. Shortly after hearing this, you will hear several warnings that the dragon has returned. Irileth will advise taking cover against the dragon's attacks and to ""make every arrow count"". Kill the Dragon[edit] The dragon, Mirmulnir, will approach from the south and will immediately begin attacking the group. Use dragon combat strategies during the battle. He will land, fight, and then fly off after losing about a quarter of his health. Once further wounded, he will remain on the ground. While at a level of around 20 or lower, Mirmulnir will be a dragon that uses fire attacks, is resistant to fire damage, and is weak against frost damage. Ranged weapons, frost or shock attacks, and melee weapons will be effective choices. If you play this quest at higher levels, Mirmulnir may attack with frost. When in the air, the dragon will use shouts, typically Fire Breath, against you, the others, and any other living creature who may happen to be in the area. Dragons are indiscriminate in their attacks, so the presence of multiple targets should relieve you of some of the onslaught. He may also use the somewhat more powerful Fireball shout. When his attention is focused elsewhere, attack with a ranged weapon or spell. If he begins to aim his face toward you while in the air, seek cover to shield you against the powerful shout that will ensue. If you get inside the watchtower, or near its door, you can effectively use its walls for this, and then step back out, or use a window or doorway to counter-attack when his shout has dissipated. When on the ground, Mirmulnir uses both physical and magic attacks. If facing you from a moderate distance, he will use his Thu'um (shouts) against you, as long as you are in his line of sight. When up-close, he will attack frontally with his jaws. If you are behind him, he will beat his tail on the ground, trying to hit you. Both of these types of attacks deal heavy physical damage. Mirmulnir approaches The dragon's wing attacks, while very strong, are the least powerful of his physical attacks. When the dragon is in the air, attack at every safe opportunity until he is forced to land. When he's on the ground, the best approach is from the side. Irileth is also useful in this fight. As an essential character in the game, she can be weakened but not killed in the attacks. Once killed, Mirmulnir will explode in flames, and then release his soul in a blast of energy. As the Dovahkiin (or ""Dragonborn""), the dragon's soul will enter your body, automatically unlocking the first word of the Unrelenting Force shout, which you learned previously during the Bleak Falls Barrow quest. After witnessing you consume the dragon's soul, a nearby guard will engage you in dialogue and exclaim that you are Dragonborn. Some of the other surviving guards will express their skepticism. Irileth will discard the notion as a myth and order you to report back to the jarl. One guard will remark that if you are Dragonborn, you can shout, and ask if you've tried. You can use your shout at this time, completing the optional quest objective, or leave them wondering. Search the dragon's body, taking dragon bones and dragon scales along with other loot. These can be used to forge and improve dragonbone and dragonscale armor and weaponsDG once your Smithing skills are highly advanced. In the lengthy intervening period, you can sell these valuable items. Search in and around the tower for any loot you can take from dead guards. Report Back to Jarl Balgruuf[edit] As you make your way back to Whiterun (note that the Dragonsreach marker will vanish temporarily during this quest), you should hear thundering voices boom out ""DOVAHKIIN!"", reverberate across the sky. Return to Dragonsreach and report to Jarl Balgruuf. He will ask you to recount events at the watchtower and then conclude that the voices were the Greybeards, ""masters of the way of the Voice"", summoning you to their secluded mountain peak residence at High Hrothgar. The jarl will inform you that the greybeards can teach you to use your gift. The jarl advises you to travel to the Greybeards immediately, as their summons is a ""great honor"". During your exchange with the jarl, his brother Hrongar will counsel confidence in you as the Dragonborn, in a calm debate with Proventus Avenicci, the jarl's Steward, who openly expresses suspicion and skepticism toward you. For your assistance in slaying the dragon, the jarl will appoint you Thane of Whiterun, which entitles you to a personal housecarl, Lydia. She will reside at Dragonsreach until you purchase Breezehome, at which point she will move in with you. Balgruuf will also reward you with the Axe of Whiterun as your symbol of office. The axe is a leveled weapon that carries a random enchantment effect. Lydia will greet you if you head toward the front door of Dragonsreach, at which point you can make her a follower by telling her that you need her help.

Approaching Gjalund, he will proudly state, ""If you're looking for passage to Solstheim, you won't find a finer vessel than the Northern Maiden."" From this you can choose to either ask how much the fare is (250 gold) or to further inquire about the island. If you choose to question him about Solstheim, he will exclaim ""Surprised you've never heard of it. It's an island northeast of here. Has a small dark elf town called Raven Rock and a handful of Nords living in Skaal Village. People don't usually sail over there unless they have a particular reason. It can be a pretty rough place."" Once you pay the fare, he will tell you ""You've got yourself a ship. We'll cast off immediately."" If you change your mind, he will sternly say ""Suit yourself. I'll be here if you change your mind."" Finding Answers[edit] Note: This section refers to dialogue options if you have previously encountered the cultists. Having already encountered the cultists, approaching Gjalund will have a somewhat different response: ""If you're looking for passage to Solstheim, too bad. I'm not going back there anymore."" From this point onward you have several dialogue options to choose from. If you choose to ask him if he's the captain, he will suspiciously confirm ""Sure. Yeah. That's me. Why? Who sent you?"" Stating that you were attacked by the cultists, he will exclaim ""Now hold on! That wasn't my fault... I didn't know they were going to attack anybody. I don't even know how I got here."" Further questioning him will lead him to tell you ""It's hard to explain... I remember those people with the masks coming on board, then... Next thing I remember, I was here and they were gone. That's not right, losing whole days like that. There's been something strange going on there for a while, but after this... I'm done. I'm not going back to Solstheim."" If you try to convince him otherwise, he will object ""Have you been listening to me? I'm not going back there."" You can also inquire about Solstheim, to which he will answer ""Surprised you've never heard of it. It's an island northeast of here. Has a small dark elf town called Raven Rock and a handful of Nords living in Skaal Village. But I'm not going back there. There's something wrong about that place."" Leaving the conversation and approaching him again, you will be able to tell Gjalund again that you need a passage into Solstheim, to which he will respond ""I already told you, I'm not going back to Solstheim."" However, now you have several dialogue options available at your disposal: Option  Dialogue  Reaction   I'll pay you double your usual rate.

After setting sail, you will arrive off the coast of Solstheim and a short cutscene will play as the boat docks in Raven Rock. Gjalund will comment, ""Well, here we are. This is Raven Rock. Can't say I'm all that glad to see it again. Good luck. Maybe you can figure out what's going on around here."" The Northern Maiden will then arrive into port shortly afterward.  An Outlander on Solstheim[edit] ""I don't recognize you, so I'll assume this is your first visit to Raven Rock, outlander. State your intentions."" Upon arrival at the docks of Raven Rock on Solstheim, if you have never been here before, you will be approached by Adril Arano, the Second Councilor of Raven Rock. At this first meeting he sternly greets you with, ""I don't recognize you, so I'll assume this is your first visit to Raven Rock, outlander. State your intentions.""  Depending on quest actions, you are given two or three options to reply to him. If you have already started the quest, you can question him if he knows someone named Miraak, to which he will reply, ""Miraak... I... I'm not sure that I do."" Further questioning him, he will respond ""I... I'm unsure. I swear I know the name, but cannot place it."" Pressing him further about the issue, he will then reveal, ""I don't think so. I'm not... The name has something to do with the Earth Stone, I think. But I'm not sure what."" This now gives you the optional objective to investigate the shrine. Regardless of which, Adril will then depart the conversation by saying ""Just remember, Raven Rock is sovereign territory of House Redoran. This is Morrowind, not Skyrim. While you're here you will be expected to abide by our laws.""  The location of the Earth Stone is almost directly west of the docks, a short distance away from the settlement of Raven Rock. However, visiting the stone itself is purely an optional objective and is not necessary in order to advance through the quest.  The Earth Stone[edit] ""Here in his shrine, that they have forgotten. Here do we toil, that we might remember. By night we reclaim, what by day was stolen. Far from ourselves, he grows ever near to us. Our eyes once were blinded, now through him do we see. Our hands once were idle, now through them does he speak. And when the world shall listen, and when the world shall see, and when the world remembers, that world will cease to be.""  ""You there... You don't seem to be in quite the same state as the others here. Very interesting. May I ask what it is you're doing here?"" Upon arrival at the stone, you will notice several of the inhabitants of Raven Rock alongside some of the Redoran guards working on what appears to be a mysterious shrine surrounding the stone. Walk toward the shrine and you will be approached by Neloth, a Telvanni wizard, and you may ask him about what is happening. He will either remark: ""You there... You don't seem to be in quite the same state as the others here. Very interesting. May I ask what it is you're doing here?"", or simply ask you what brings you to Raven Rock. When you explain to Neloth that you are searching for Miraak, he will exclaim: ""Miraak... Miraak... It sounds familiar, and yet I can't quite place... Oh. Wait, I recall. But that makes very little sense. Miraak's been dead for thousands of years."" Inquire about the meaning of this and he will answer: ""I'm not sure, but it is fascinating, isn't it? Perhaps it has some relation to what's going on here. Quite unexpected. I'm afraid I can't give you any answers. But there are ruins of an ancient temple of Miraak's toward the center of the island. If I were you, I'd look there."" This will now direct you towards the Temple of Miraak to investigate further about the cultist attack. You may also choose to further question Neloth. Asking what exactly they are building, he will reply: ""Building something, clearly. And yet they don't seem to have much to say about it. I'm very interested to find out what happens when they finish."" If you also question him as to stopping the workers, he will exclaim: ""Certainly not! Doing so would interfere with whatever is going on, and I would be unable to see how this all turns out.""  Temple of Miraak[edit] ""Here in my temple, here in my shrine, that you have forgotten. Here do you toil, that you might remember. Here you reclaim, what faithless minds have stolen. Far from yourself, I grow ever nearer to you. Your eyes once were blinded, now through me do you see. Your hands once were idle, now through them do I speak. And when the world shall listen, and when the world shall see, and when the world remembers, that world will cease to be.""  Dragon skeletons litter the pathway leading up to the temple. If you choose not to visit the Earth Stone, you can speak with various citizens of Raven Rock about Miraak. You will realize that most citizens recognize the name, but are uncertain why, just like Adril. Some will again mention the Earth Stone, while others will mention the Temple of Miraak. Once you've been told about the location of the temple, a new objective marker will lead you there. In order to reach the temple, head east from Raven Rock, towards the center of Solstheim. As you approach the exterior of the temple, you'll see skeletons of several dragons littering the pathway leading up to the temple. As you climb up the stairs and further to the temple, you'll see many of Miraak's thralls working to rebuild it. They will also be chanting, as were the thralls at the Earth Stone. None of the enthralled people will attack you, but some cultists will appear and become aggressive if you wait outside of the temple too long. Once you reach the center of the exterior portion of the Temple of Miraak, near the Tree Stone, this quest will be complete, and the next quest will begin automatically. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked during this quest if you have not yet visited Solstheim: Outlander (20 points/Bronze) — Arrive on Solstheim"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragonslayer","Meet with the heroes of Sovngarde. Coordinate your shouts to clear Alduin's mist. Defeat the World-Eater in combat.","Heroes Unite[edit] Leave the Hall of Valor and cross the Whalebone Bridge to the edge of the Shadowed Vale, where your Nord brethren are gathered. They are as eager to slay Alduin as you are. When the three heroes have assembled, you will take your place by their sides. Once you have done so, one of them will suggest that you all use the Clear Skies Shout together to blow away the mist. Your companions will wait for you to Shout then use their Thu'um as well. You need to do this three times when requested, as Alduin recovers the field in mist the first two times you clear it away. After your third Shout, the mist dissipates, Alduin becomes enraged and flies towards you and the final battle is joined. The World-Eater[edit] The death of the World-Eater This is when you begin your last fight with Alduin. Alduin launches a barrage of fire attacks at you, the Nords, and any lost souls that have been freed from their permanent fog. Alduin's rain of fire ability hits a large area of effect so have wards, healing spells and/or potions ready. To defeat Alduin, you must once again strike him with Dragonrend to force him to land. Until you do, he is invincible and will take no damage. While on the ground, it is relatively easy to kill him due to the fact that the three Nord heroes will help in the battle. Alduin is basically the same as every other dragon the Dragonborn has thus far encountered: melee from the sides to avoid the potent tail attack, have a shield handy if you're planning to go head-to-head. For archers, Alduin is just as susceptible to potent poisons as other living creatures. Hit from a distance with high-damage lingering poisons and he will stay down fairly quickly. For magic users, the Marked for Death Shout is very useful as it increases his susceptibility to damage from spells. Don't stand in front of him, as his fire breath is deadly even to high level players. Resist Fire and Resist Magic may help against this. After you strike the killing blow, Alduin writhes in agony and his soul begins to vanish. Alduin thrashes on the ground as his soul leaves his corporeal form. As his essence drains away, a black tar-like skeleton is revealed underneath. His form continues to corrode, fading into wisps and with a final, thunderous spasm, Alduin is torn apart; not even his skeleton remains in this afterlife. Alduin's End[edit] Dragon reception at the Throat of the World As the mist of Alduin's soul snare dissipates and the sky clears, Tsun congratulates you on your mighty deed, as do your three helpers and all the characters lost in the mist, who will make their way to the bridge. Before leaving Sovngarde, Tsun teaches you the Call of Valor Shout, which allows you to summon a hero from Sovngarde to fight by your side. You will not be able to reenter the Hall of Valor, so when you are ready to leave, talk to Tsun and he will Shout you back to Tamriel. The Obituary[edit] Upon returning to Tamriel, you will be returned to the Throat of the World and greeted by a large number of dragons perched there. They recite a chant together acknowledging the Dovahkiin and the destruction of Alduin the World-Eater, departing one by one as they do: Alduin mahlaan Sahrot thur qahnaraan Alduin mahlaan Dovahkiin los ok dovahkriid Alduin mahlaan Thu'umii los nahlot Alduin mahlaan Mu los vomir If you did not already kill Paarthurnax, he will have a final conversation with you, and expresses hope to convince other dragons to join the Way of the Voice before flying off himself. Afterwards, if you are still on the mountaintop, Odahviing will come to admit his allegiance to you so that you may freely use his Thu'um to call him, though he warns that not all dragons are willing to follow Paarthurnax's example. Returning to High Hrothgar or Sky Haven Temple will yield further closing dialogue with Arngeir or Esbern, respectively. This is easy to miss because the game relies on you to think of returning to the ""wise old man"". Congratulations! You have completed Skyrim's Main Quest, and may now continue your adventures. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest and finish the questline: Dragonslayer (50 points/Gold)"

Return for your reward.","Keeping the Mine Safe[edit] Dravynea the Stoneweaver is a Dark Elf alteration expert living in Kynesgrove. When she is not working in the Steamscorch Mine, you can find her wandering the town or in the Braidwood Inn.  Should you be in the market for some free Alteration training, ask her about her business in Kynesgrove. She will explain that she uses her powers as a mage to keep the mine safe. She is able to make a potion using frost salts to keep the temperature in the mine bearable, but is out of frost salts at the moment. Tell her that you can get some for her. She will off-handedly offer you free training if you actually bring her the salts. Finding Frost Salts[edit] The quest will update to ""Bring some Frost Salts to Dravynea"". While the term ""some"" is rather ambiguous, only one bowl of frost salts is required to fulfill the objective. If you do not have a sample in your inventory already, there are many ways to obtain a sample: from the corpse of a frost atronach, purchasing one from an apothecary merchant, creating a sample at the Atronach Forge, or placed randomly on shelves. If you are a member of the College of Winterhold, you have access to two free samples in the Hall of Countenance alchemy lab. The Reward[edit] When you have your sample, take it to Dravynea to complete the quest. She will seem surprised that you actually came through, and will give you a free training session equaling one level of Alteration as a reward."

On one of the shores, built into the side of a mountain, is a wooden door to Gallows Hall which the player can enter. As you approach the wooden door on the first floor of Gallows Hall, it will be slammed shut, the room will fill with a mist, and objects in the room will start to fly around. You will need to read Naara's journal, which can be found next to her body, alongside three notes. The journal will mention that the map in the center of the room is a good place to start.  Go to the map to find that there is a clue placed on top of it. Interact with the torches on the walls of the room based on the clue, which each torch given the name of a place in Skyrim, which will prevent any errors with trying to align cities and towns with the circle of sconces.

After picking up the third Soul Gem, the player will find themselves back at the altar in the middle of the room, and they should read the Arch Necromancer's final instructions that is upon it.

Speak to Ranmir and then Haran again to learn that Isabelle went to see Vex in Riften. Talk to Vex in the Ragged Flagon. Find Isabelle Rolaine in Hob's Fall Cave. Return to Ranmir with her note.","The Great Collapse[edit] Ever since the Great Collapse, the once prosperous town of Winterhold has been in a state of disarray, with only a few inhabitants left. The only remaining merchant, Birna, and her brother Ranmir have both felt the agony in the wake of the Collapse, as most of the townsfolk are long gone, providing little income for the family store.  When you visit Winterhold for the first time, you will witness an argument between the two in the middle of the street, and they will continue inside local inn The Frozen Hearth: ""Please, come home. Just... Just come home."" Birna: ""Please, come home. Just... Just come home."" Ranmir: ""Can't. Got at least two rounds to go. Why don't you go... sell something."" Birna: ""Why? Because I'd rather be here trying to keep my only brother from drinking himself to death."" Ranmir: ""Ha! Drink ain't gonna kill me. Not today, anyway."" While Birna keeps her store open for nobody, Ranmir proceeds to down mead around the clock inside the Frozen Hearth, seemingly falling apart, much to the dismay of the innkeeper, Dagur and waitress Haran. When listening in on their conversations, however, it becomes apparent that there may be another reason Ranmir became the town drunk: Haran: ""How long are we going to let Ranmir drink himself into a stupor? When will enough be enough?"" Dagur: ""As long as he keeps paying, I suppose. He keeps to himself, and isn't hurting anyone."" Haran: ""Are you so sure of that? I think Birna might disagree with you."" Dagur: ""It's not my place to get involved in their family's business, remember? You're the one that told me to stay out of it."" The Concerned Innkeeper[edit] ""How long are we going to let Ranmir drink himself into a stupor?"" After helping Ranmir pay his debts to Haran, concerned innkeeper Dagur will have a new dialogue option, namely asking if there is anything to do around the inn. Dagur will then tell you about the very reason Ranmir became the town drunk: ""Listen, we're friends, right? I wondered if I could ask a favor of you. It's about Ranmir. Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with him being here all the time. He mostly keeps to himself, and so far he's been able to pay. I just hate to see what's happened to him. He hasn't always been like this, you know. Drunk, I mean."" He then proceeds to tell you about Ranmir's broken heart: ""Oh, he was a different person. Happy, outgoing... Like anyone who's in love. See, Ranmir was involved with a pretty young woman named Isabelle Rolaine. The two of them were very happy together, I thought. One day, she just disappeared. Ranmir was convinced she'd run off with someone else, leaving him behind. He turned to drinking, and what's left of him is what you see here every day."" He then reasons that if Isabelle could be found, Ranmir could get some peace of mind and get his act back together. When asked about Isabelle, Ranmir will get overly insulted, saying: ""Don't you... Don't you say that name to me. Don't you dare. Ever."" Luckily, the equally concerned Haran has a bit of information on Isabelle's whereabouts, although she will hint that Isabelle is hanging out with a bad crowd: ""It's none of your business. Those aren't folks you want to get tangled up with."" She will then explain the danger: ""One night Ranmir was in here like always, drinking himself to death. When I told him there was no more Honningbrew, that he'd drank it all, he got angry. He ranted at me, how I didn't know what he's been through, how Isabelle broke his heart when she ran off with some thief named Vex..."" Vex[edit] If you are a member of the Thieves Guild, you already know master infiltrator Vex. She can always be found hanging out at the Ragged Flagon. If you have completed Taking Care of Business, she will even talk to you, and you will have the option to ask her about Isabelle Rolaine. When confronted with the name Ranmir, she will get exasperated: ""Not him again. He came nosing around Riften a while back, making a lot of noise about me. He was... persuaded to leave before he found me. Funny, I'd have thought she would've gone back to him by now."" Once she reveals she knew Isabelle, she will say: ""She came through a while ago, wanted to know where she could get her hands on something valuable. Anything, really. I told her it was a bad idea, that she wasn't cut out for what'd be necessary, but she wouldn't hear it. So I gave her some advice, pointed her towards Hobs [sic] Fall Cave and that was that."" Drowned Sorrows[edit] Isabelle Rolaine Hob's Fall Cave is a small cave between Dawnstar and Ranmir's hometown, Winterhold. According to Vex, Isabelle went there to seek out treasure from the residing warlocks, but never made it far. As you approach the cave, stains of blood will lead to the entrance and right inside, you will find Isabelle leaning against a rock, dead. Examine her body and you will find her letter, her own full explanation for leaving her beloved Ranmir behind and seeking a fortune in a remote cave: ""I know it's been hard on you, on both of us, struggling to survive. I hate to see the look in your eyes every time you think about how little the two of us have, and I know you're too proud to ever say anything. So I'm going to make it all better."" Return to Ranmir and hand him the letter and watch while he reads it: ""Don't you go pulling my leg. Give it here. This... This is really from her, isn't it? Did she really run off and do this? For me? By the Eight. She's dead, isn't she? And it's all my fault. I... I have some thinking to do. Thank you for this."" Ranmir will then leave the Frozen Hearth, and vanish."

Once you enter this section of the dungeon, a wizard named Elberon will be struck by lightning, dying instantly. This quest will then begin, prompting you to loot Elberon's corpse for his strange Dwarven Crown. Once you've obtained the Crown, you will be prompted to search for three masks which can be slotted into the headpiece. All three of these can be found within the dungeon in their corresponding areas, although they are designed to be well-hidden and therefore may take a bit of exploration to find. Mask of Autumn[edit] The Dwarven Autumn Visage is located in the Autumn's Bells section of Runoff Caverns. Head east after entering the main chamber until you find the bridge over the ravine; after crossing the bridge, go north along the brick road and it will lead you straight to the entrance to the corridor that leads to the mask. Mask of Spring[edit] The Dwarven Spring Visage is located in the Spring's Symphony section of Runoff Caverns. It is located at the end of a side hallway accessible through a door a short way into the chamber. However, the door is locked; the key is held by the Blooming Spriggan Matron boss at the end of the section. The hallway is partially filled with a green miasma, so the Dwarven Drone Fly you obtain in the room on your right just before you jump out of this section might prove useful. Mask of Winter[edit] The Dwarven Winter Visage is found in the Winter's Chimes section of Runoff Caverns, in a hidden area that can be challenging to find. It is located in the second section, after you make the first jump. It is off the short hallway containing Frosted Dwarven Spiders, through a Dwarven gate that is raised above ground level. The gate must be reached by climbing up a bank of snow and a sloped Dwarven pipe (as pictured above). From the gate, you must dive into the water through a short underwater passage to access the section. Once you have navigated to the chamber containing the mask, you will be attacked by a powerful Frosted Dwarven Centurion which uses frost attacks. Forging the Crown[edit] The masks can be worn on their own, but you can make their effects more powerful by affixing one to the crown. Take the crown, a mask, and two leather strips to any forge or anvil, and you can craft the Dwarven Crown of Autumn, the Dwarven Crown of Spring, or the Dwarven Crown of Winter. You can only have one of these at a time, but you can swap them out with each other at a forge as often as you like, only costing you two leather strips each time."

Outside, you will find a ""Broken Dwarven Horse"", a metallic Dwarven torso lying partially submerged in a stream. Activate this object to begin the quest, which will task you with assembling the pieces to reconstruct this strange equine construct. All of the parts are in the Autumn's Bells section of Runoff Caverns, which is found deep inside, within the Dwarven ruins of Vardnknd. You will need to traverse the entirety of the Runoff Caverns section of the dungeon to reach the hub area at Vardnknd Gallery. The entrance to Autumn's Bells is in this central chamber. The horse head sitting on a pile of gold Exploring the Ruins[edit] All of the Dwarven items needed to reconstruct the horse are zero weight due to being quest items, so you needn't worry about getting them back out of the ruins. They will not be marked on your map until you get close, meaning you may need to scour the area to find them all. You will need to locate five in total: The first part of the horse is easy to find: it is the Horse Right Front Leg next to the dead mercenary in the entrance hallway of Autumn's Bells. You will likely come across this mercenary while completing the Forgotten Seasons quest. The Horse Left Back Leg is in the main chamber, near the field of White Molded Wheat. It is on the east side of the collapsed tower (behind a chest). The Horse Right Back Leg is on the other side of the main chamber, which will necessitate crossing the bridge in the center. It's under a collapsed building to the south from the Sickly Green Wheat. The Horse Left Front Leg is up on a pedestal along the southern wall of the main chamber. The final piece of the horse will necessitate completing the Autumn's Bells puzzle. This can be done by harvesting samples of the six special wheat varieties found growing in the chamber and placing them in the depositors located back near the field of Glowing Red Wheat. Once all six wheat varieties have been deposited, the chamber containing the Conduit Control Gem will be unlocked; the Horse Head lies on a pile of gold within. Reward[edit] With all five pieces assembled, you can return to the surface and activate the broken torso once again. Doing so will create a functioning Dwarven Horse, which can be ridden as a mount. It takes no damage whatsoever; you can stay mounted on it and avoid all harm."

After the conversation, the quest will then update to give the location, a camp northeast of Fort Greenwall. The Ebony Warrior will not attack you when approached, and will not speak. He will simply stand, brandishing his sword as a clear invitation. You must initiate the attack for the battle to begin. Make sure that you are prepared for one serious fight. It is advised to wear the strongest armor you can get and have plenty of potions at the ready. You may want to bring a follower as well. The Ebony Warrior is arguably the toughest enemy in the game, and his high armor rating and multiple elemental resistances make him hard to kill for both mages and melee characters. He also has a number of perks to aid him in combat, including the top perks in the One-Handed, Archery, and Heavy Armor skills. He is the only non-Nord NPC capable of using certain dragon shouts in combat. These shouts include Unrelenting Force, which may easily knock you off the edge of the nearby cliffs. The Ebony Warrior can also be harmed by falling damage, but you must damage him after he lands but before he stands back up for the damage to take effect, otherwise he can survive any fall and will actually be restored to full health after he gets back on his feet. Whatever your tactics, once you have defeated the Ebony Warrior the quest will conclude and you may loot his body for his fully enchanted set of equipment and a few other treasures."

Receive the necessary items from Septimus Signus. Locate the ancient Dwemer city of Blackreach. Claim the Elder Scroll.","Fragments of Creation[edit] Alduin's Wall documents how the ancient Nords of the First Era used a special shout to help them dispose of Alduin. Your search for this particular shout takes you to High Hrothgar and eventually to the leader of the Greybeards, the dragon Paarthurnax. He reveals that the Throat of the World was indeed the battleground where the ancient Nords fought Alduin and ended the Dragon War. He also reveals that the Dragonrend shout was not enough to truly defeat Alduin, in reality merely crippling him. In a final attempt to banish Alduin, the Nords were forced to use an Elder Scroll to send their foe forward in time, postponing the threat, but not ending it. The event created a rift in time itself atop the mountain, known as the Time-Wound. Paarthurnax believes that, in order to learn the Dragonrend shout, you will have to locate the Elder Scroll, then use it to open the Time-Wound and learn the shout from the ancient Nords that created it. To begin your lengthy quest for the legendary Scroll, you will need to talk to either Arngeir or Esbern. ""If the world is meant to end, so be it.""Arngeir's WarningIf you choose to question Arngeir about obtaining an Elder Scroll, you will find him inside High Hrothgar, where he will be reading, meditating, or sleeping. Arngeir is more skeptical than Esbern about the necessity of learning the Dragonrend shout and, when asked how one would find an Elder Scroll, he will vehemently protest: ""Such blasphemies are the calling of mages, not followers of the Way. Take your question to the College of Winterhold. They may be able to help you."" When asked if there is another way to defeat Alduin, he will explain his uncertainty: ""Perhaps not. But this Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again. Have you considered that Alduin was not meant to be defeated? Those who overthrew him in ancient times only postponed the day of reckoning, they did not stop it. If the world is meant to end, so be it. Let it end and be reborn.""    ""The whole world was in darkness.""Esbern's DreamIf you choose to visit Esbern, you will find him outside Sky Haven Temple, where he and Delphine can be seen staring into the horizon as Esbern recalls a strange dream he once had about Alduin. After the story, Esbern will greet you as if he only just realized your presence: ""Ah, you're back. I hope you've made some progress on tracking down this Shout we need to defeat Alduin?"" You can then explain that you need an Elder Scroll in order to learn Dragonrend. He will be intrigued: ""Ah, indeed? There's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. Let me think... Perhaps the College of Winterhold. What learning there is in Skyrim is gathered there. One of the mages there may be able to put you on the trail of this Elder Scroll."" An Incomprehensible Book[edit] Urag gro-Shub and his two books on the Elder Scrolls Make your way to the College of Winterhold. If you have not joined the College, you will be forced to start the initiation quest, First Lessons, to get past gatekeeper Faralda. If you are already a member, enter the College as normal and follow your map marker to the Arcanaeum. Here you will find the librarian Urag gro-Shub. After belittling you for your ignorance, he will fill you in on the potential dangers of the Scrolls: ""An Elder Scroll is an instrument of immense knowledge and power. To read an Elder Scroll, a person must have the most rigorously trained mind, or else risk madness. Even so, the Divines usually take the reader's sight as a price."" He will then elaborate on the incredible nature of the Elder Scrolls: ""The simplest way to put it is ""knowledge,"" but there's nothing simple about an Elder Scroll. It's a reflection of all possible futures and all possible pasts. Each reader sees different reflections through different lenses, and may come away with a very different reading. But at the same time, all of it is true. Even the falsehoods. Especially the falsehoods."" You can also ask him who wrote the Elder Scrolls and he will respond: ""It would take a month to explain to you how that very question doesn't even make sense. The Scrolls exist here, with us, but also beyond and beneath. Before and after. They are bits of Divine made substance so we could know them. Some people who study them devoutly go mad."" Naturally, Urag does not have a Scroll lying around, and he wouldn't simply give it to you if he had. After a short discussion, Urag leaves his spot behind the counter and fetches two rare books for you, Ruminations on the Elder Scrolls and Effects of the Elder Scrolls. The first book is written by Septimus Signus and starts the concurrent quest Discerning the Transmundane when opened. When you tell Urag that Signus's book is incomprehensible, he will explain that Septimus Signus is a specialist in Elder Scrolls lore, but he has not been back to the College for a long time. He mentions that Signus became obsessed with the Dwemer and took off north to study an old artifact. Beyond the Physical World[edit] Septimus Signus and the Dwemer lockbox From this point, the quest Discerning the Transmundane will be part of your quest to claim the Elder Scroll. Follow your map marker to a remote ice cavern named Septimus Signus's Outpost and enter. Inside you will find Septimus Signus pacing before a huge device with a strange-looking lock, muttering to himself about the Dwemer. When questioned on the Elder Scrolls, his answer will be just as incomprehensible as his book: ""Elder Scrolls. Indeed. The Empire. They absconded with them. Or so they think. The ones they saw. The ones they thought they saw. I know of one. Forgotten. Sequestered. But I cannot go to it, not poor Septimus, for I... I have arisen beyond its grasp."" When you inquire as to the location of the Scroll, he will respond: ""Here. Well, here as in this plane. Mundus. Tamriel. Nearby, relatively speaking. On the cosmological scale, it's all nearby."" He will then agree to help you, but only if you help him, naturally. He'll point towards the Dwemer lockbox in the icy cavern and say: ""You see this masterwork of the Dwemer. Deep inside their greatest knowings. Septimus is clever among men, but he is but an idiot child compared to the dullest of the Dwemer. Lucky then they left behind their own way of reading the Elder Scrolls. In the depths of Blackreach one yet lies."" He will explain what Blackreach is and what you must go through: ""Under deep. Below the dark. The hidden keep. Tower Mzark. Alftand. The point of puncture, of first entry, of the tapping. Delve to its limits, and Blackreach lies just beyond. But not all can enter there. Only Septimus knows the hidden key to loose the lock to jump beneath the deathly rock."" While it is clear that Septimus doesn't care about the Elder Scroll itself, it is quite clear that he needs the information it possesses. You will have no choice but to help him. He will hand you two items, the Blank Lexicon and the Attunement Sphere. A knowledgeable person indeed, he will then provide his complex explanation on what to do with the items, including a tip that will prove valuable later. He will also provide his knowledge on what defines an Elder Scroll: ""You look to your left, you see one way. You look to your right, you see another. But neither is any harder than the opposite. But the Elder Scrolls... they look left and right in the stream of time. The future and past are as one. Sometimes they even look up. What do they see then? What if they dive in? Then the madness begins.""  NOTE: While the map marker will point you towards Alftand, you can gain access to Blackreach from two other ruins, specifically Mzinchaleft and Raldbthar. However, if you have yet to clear either of those, the route through Alftand is recommended as your map marker will point you in the right direction. Alftand[edit] Alftand The Dwemer ruin of Alftand is located southwest of Winterhold. The exterior area contains a deserted camp, but upon investigating the ruined shack near the campsite, you will find an Expedition Manifest written by expedition leader Sulla Trebatius, hinting that you may not be alone when traversing Alftand. From the shack, head down the slope and enter the first zone, Alftand Glacial Ruins. The Lost Expedition[edit] The icy tunnel ahead contains no enemies but plenty of destroyed cooking spits, and before long you will see blood spatters all over the floor. A little further down the tunnel, you will hear the voice of one of the Khajiit members of the expedition in a Skooma-induced rant, demanding that his companion tell him where the rest of the Skooma is hidden. Head east through the tunnel and follow the path as it twists and turns. You will soon arrive in a room with a table and Calcelmo's book Dwarves, v2 along with some Research Notes from Sulla Trebatius. The door to the north is barred, so take the western path and fight the dwarven automatons that guard it. As the tunnel becomes icy again, you will encounter J'darr, mad from Skooma withdrawal, who will attack you on sight. In the corner, you will find the corpse of his brother J'zhar, lying in a pool of his own blood. Leave the bodies behind and head north until you reach a chamber with two dwarven spheres. Proceed forward. To the left, there are a set of rising and falling platforms. If you manage to get onto the tallest of the three, there will be two unlocked chests, with several potions and a jewel on a nearby surface. Then proceed through the only available path, where you will find a forge and more dwarven spiders. In this room, you can find Umana's Journal, which describes how the dangers of Alftand have claimed even more victims. Before you open the western door, there will be a novice-locked gate containing two locked chests (adept and apprentice) and various small dwemer items. After opening the western door, beware of the dwarven pressure plate in front of the chest at the top of the stairs. To the right will be another dwarven spider, easy to either kill or sneak past, and an adept-locked chest. From there, head south, where another spider will be waiting. Directly past it, on your left, will be a room containing a potion of minor stamina and a potion of either vigorous or extreme healing. Even further ahead on the right is an apprentice-locked door. Inside is a dwarven sphere, an unlocked chest, two beds, and various other dwarven items. Past this the hallway splits into two: on the left, a long ledge featuring dwarven spider workers and pipes that could easily push you off; to the right, a solitary spider focused on attacking the wall, and a Blacksmith's Potion. Climb across to the end of the ledge and proceed to the Alftand Animonculory. The Eyeless Creatures[edit] The Animonculory door opens up into another hallway. Turn left past the first gear in the wall to find an unlocked chest, a Falmer helmet and shield, a hint as to your future enemies, and assorted dwemer items. Open the door at the far end and enter the enormous chamber beyond. To your right will be a distracted Dwarven Spider Worker; if you enter the small pathway next to the stairs, you will find yet another deceased expedition member, Endrast, who is still holding his journal. On top of the journal are a lockpick and stick of charcoal, and opposite the body is an adept-locked chest. Retrace your steps, climb the stairs and find the slope to the east, where a Dwarven Sphere is patrolling. There are three pressure plates here that trigger a deadly set of spinning blades. Dodge these and proceed to the level. The central chamber of the Animonculory This room is the first very large, multi-leveled chamber in Alftand. You are on the top level, so start making your way down the slopes and fight the enemies as you go. The area near the beginning, as you step down the first ramp, contains a Dwarven Spider, a potion of extreme magicka, and a novice-locked chest. When you have traversed one floor, an apprentice-locked door to the east leads to some worthwhile treasure. Inside is another Dwarven Spider Worker, two other gates (One unlocked and open, with an unlocked chest imside; the other with an expert lock. Inside are two chests, one unlocked, one master-locked, two potions, a Dwarven Helmet, a skeleton, and a book.)You'll need to make a short jump down to proceed, where you will land near the body of Yag gra-Gortwog. To the southeast is another slope leading down, where you will find the first Falmer enemy. Stay on the path and kill any Falmer that get in your way. You will reach a platform with a door and a broken pipe spitting out fire. Open the door to leave the huge chamber for now and proceed forward towards an alchemy lab and several Falmer emerging from their tents. Dodge the flames coming from the pipes and head south until you reach a junction. The stairs to the east lead to a small room with some ingredients, while the path south will lead you to the next room. In this room, the elevator on the other side of the barred doorway leads back to the previous zone, Alftand Glacial Ruins, so at this point it is possible to return to the outside world and stock up on supplies. Otherwise, skip the elevator ride and locate Sulla Trebatius's Pack. You will also find a table holding the dead body of Valie and another with an array of rare ingredients, including a small pearl, one of only two samples in Skyrim. Find the path to the northeast and open the door. You will find yourself back in the huge central chamber, where you can continue your descent. There are three Falmer and a frostbite spider at the bottom of the chamber; dispose of them and locate the door to the north and enter. The next area contains a tripwire, which triggers a claw trap. Avoid the tripwire and the trap and continue into Alftand Cathedral. The Dwemer Mechanism[edit] The Cathedral Alftand Cathedral is the last zone of Alftand, and the smallest as well. Upon entering, take a right turn and dodge the three pressure plates, all of which will trigger a slicer from the ceiling. Fight a single Falmer enemy and open the door to another huge chamber, where you will find more Falmer. Dispose of them, take a moment to explore the room for lots of chests and loot, then head up the stairs next to the entrance and pull the lever. This lowers the spikes blocking the gate to the west, but approach the area carefully as you will awaken a dwarven centurion. After the battle, loot the centurion for the Key to Alftand Lift and head up the stairs. Open the gate where you will witness the last two survivors of the failed expedition, Sulla Trebatius and Umana, having a conversation revealing Sulla's true intentions: Umana: ""Sulla look, the passage is open, wait... there's someone down there!"" Sulla: ""No! Blackreach was to be my discovery!"" Umana: ""Sulla, let's just get out of here. Hasn't there been enough death?"" Sulla: ""Oh, of course you want me to leave. Just waiting for me to turn my back. So you can have all the glory for yourself!"" Sulla and Umana will then proceed to fight each other; keep your distance until one is victorious (usually Umana). The other will then turn against you. Dispose of them and investigate Umana's body for the unique shield Targe of the Blooded. Turn your attention towards the Dwarven Mechanism in the center of the room. Activate it, and the Attunement Sphere will do the rest, revealing a staircase leading downward. You can return to the outside world from here by using your newly acquired key on the gate to the southwest. This will also provide a useful shortcut for later visits (make sure to open the gate at the top of the elevator). From here, head down the stairs and prepare yourself for Blackreach. Blackreach[edit] Blackreach The Tower of Mzark Finally, you will be in Blackreach, a vast, beautiful, eerie, and dangerous underground cavern that will take time to traverse completely. Dwarven automatons and Falmer continue to be common enemies, and you may encounter chaurus and giants as well. Blackreach can be overwhelming and quite difficult to navigate, especially since your in-game map will only ever allow you to see a portion of the cavern. Additionally, it is loaded with distractions, so stay on the path for now and keep your eye on the prize: the Elder Scroll. The fastest route from Alftand to the Tower of Mzark is the road to the left, immediately out of the Alftand Cathedral. Continue along the road in a southeastern direction and fight a dwarven sphere and a Falmer. When you come to the first junction, make a right and head southwest along that road and fight more chaurus and another Falmer. As you travel underneath a bridge, a Falmer will shoot arrows at you from above, but just move forward and stay on the path. Fight two chaurus and continue on until the path turns in a western direction, across a bridge. When you cross the bridge, the Tower of Mzark will be visible to the southwest, and the trail will lead you right to the entrance. The Elder Scroll[edit] The Elder Scroll recovered Once you have entered the Tower of Mzark, investigate the first room for some minor loot. The Smithing skill book The Armorer's Challenge is located in the west facing corner of the room (to the right of the doorway on the far wall). Proceed through the door and behold a Dwemer contraption that would make even Septimus Signus proud: a giant sphere with various lenses fills the entire first floor of the room. The second floor sits on the upper part of the sphere and, hanging from the ceiling, a series of lenses conceal a container. If you investigate the surrounding area, you will find the skeletal remains of Drokt. His journal will inform you how he became obsessed with the Oculory, and he seemingly died without managing to align it correctly. The journal also contains a tip on how to solve the puzzle: ""The light through the knowledge through the machine rests on the cube."" This echoes the words of Septimus Signus: ""The Dwemer found a loophole, as they always do. To focus the knowledge away and inside without harm. Place the lexicon into their contraption and focus the knowings into it."" With these two tips in mind, head up the last slope, where you will find four buttons and a Lexicon Receptacle. Place the Blank Lexicon in the receptacle and watch the ceiling of the room open, shining light onto the container beneath. This also activates the two buttons on the right. To focus the lenses on the floor, place yourself so you can see the Lexicon and the central floor. Activate the button on the second pedestal from the right four times in a row and the Lexicon will open. This also activates one of the buttons to the left. Press the second button from the left twice and the lenses in the ceiling will change position, allowing the light shining through the container to hit the corresponding lenses on the floor, thus filling the Lexicon with knowledge. The last button to the left will now be active, so push it once and the upper lenses will move aside, making room for the container to be lowered down from the ceiling. Once it has reached the floor, it will open and reveal the legendary Elder Scroll (Dragon), the very source of the elder knowledge, yours for the taking. Remember to pick up the inscribed Runed Lexicon from the receptacle, then claim the Elder Scroll. This ends the quest and starts the next one, Alduin's Bane. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: Elder Knowledge (20 points/Bronze)"

Return to Elisif.","A Personal Request[edit] After you complete The Man Who Cried Wolf, Elisif's goodwill towards you has increased. So much so that she extends a tentative trust in you by making a personal request regarding her late husband, High King Torygg. She will tell you, ""When we buried my husband I made offerings to all the gods... except Talos."" This is because Talos worship is outlawed in the Empire. She would like you to take Torygg's War Horn and place it at a specific Shrine of Talos. Although she doesn't worship Talos herself, her husband would have wanted a proper Nordic burial done in this fashion. The Shrine of Talos[edit] Travel to the Shrine of Talos in the wilderness of Whiterun Hold, due north of The Ritual Stone. Follow the path near Shimmermist Cave, along the northern bank of the river, and you can find the shrine behind some trees. As you approach the shrine, Agent Lorcalin and a Thalmor soldier will appear and attack you, as Lorcalin is under orders from the Thalmor emissary to kill any Talos worshippers he can find.

You'll need to start by learning an enchantment. Take an enchanted weapon or piece of armor, then use the Arcane Enchanter to learn its secrets. The item is destroyed in the process, so be wary. Once you know an enchantment, you'll need a filled soul gem, and something to enchant. You'll use the Arcane Enchanter for that, too. Of course I have everything you need for sale, if you have the coin.""' Master in the Making[edit] Using this advice, you may walk over to his arcane enchanter and begin enchanting. The quest will complete upon activating the enchanter. It is not necessary to enchant or even disenchant an item to complete this quest."

In fact, he wants to be an adventurer like you, but his father Mralki doesn't agree.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Evil_in_Waiting","Enter Valthume and speak to the ghost named Valdar. Collect the vessels from each of Hevnoraak's draugr minions. Kill the Dragon Priest Hevnoraak.","The Forgotten Ruin[edit] ""Leave, stranger. Evil stirs in this place."" The Nordic ruin of Valthume lies southeast of Markarth at the end of the path that leads southeast from Dushnikh Yal. No citizens will ever mention the ruin, although the Greybeards may detect a ""whisper of a word"" from the location, as there is a Word Wall in the ruin. They can point you in the right direction. When you arrive there will be no enemies guarding the exterior door leading into the side of the great mountain, but there is a possibility of a troll encounter, so be on guard. Enter Valthume Vestibule and you will immediately be sought out by a ghost named Valdar who will provide a warning: ""Leave, stranger. Evil stirs in this place. I fear for the security of the very land if it should break free."" If you ask for more details, the ghost will elaborate on the danger that lurks within: ""We stand at the tomb of Hevnoraak, who has been dead for many generations. I fear, however, that his return may be at hand."" Valdar reveals that he stayed behind to constrain the power of the Dragon Priest Hevnoraak, but that his own strength is fading away. Due to this weakness, he needs a champion to find three vessels scattered around the large ruin; their combined power can help vanquish Hevnoraak, thus saving the land of Skyrim from his vengeance. Accept the challenge and Valdar will open a gate in the back of the vestibule leading to the real ruin of Valthume. He will then sit down on his throne atop his own skeleton, and you can gather some more information on the threat waiting to break out of his prison: ""Hevnoraak planned his resurrection obsessively before dying. My duty in life and in death is to make sure he stays in this tomb for eternity."" Apparently, Valthume was a former den of dragon worshippers, with Hevnoraak as their leader: ""He had a way of enthralling people and built up a loyal army of followers. Good men fell under his spell and were forever twisted. Made... evil. After that, fear was enough to keep them in line. He could torture and humiliate them and they would not rebel. Even in death, they serve him still."" Valthume[edit] ""Even in death, they serve him still."" While the exterior of the ruin only consists of a single door, the ruin of Valthume is incredibly large and far from linear; make sure to keep an eye on the map markers and prepare for a fairly long trek to gather all three vessels. The first chamber is huge, with no enemies in sight. Hevnoraak's sarcophagus stands in the middle of the room, sealed shut, with his throne strategically placed in the background. You can do nothing here now, so locate the southern stairway and jump over the pressure plate to avoid the corresponding battering ram around the corner. Proceed forward and dispose of the draugr enemies. The door to the south is sealed shut from the other side, so go through the tunnel to the east. Before long, you will stand in a huge chamber, clearly an area for offerings, which is inhabited by two leveled draugr. The overhanging ledges provide an opportunity for ranged attacks. Claim some loot in a hidden room above the altar, by jumping to the side balcony, then jump again to the corner balcony, and then jump yet again to reach the altar. then jump down and open the chest on the floor. There is a trap door that will net you a fight against four frostbite spiders and a draugr carrying the key to escape the trap, but little else. Instead, take the southern tunnel and open the door to your right for the Restoration skill book Withershins. You will pass a tantalizing expert-locked door, however it leads only to the aforementioned pit containing the spiders. Return to the tunnel and make your way through several fire traps and beware of the four pressure plates triggering darts. The room contains two exits, both of them closed, so pull the handle near the eastern stone wall and watch it lower. Behind you, the metal gate will disappear as well, but ignore it for now and choose the eastern path. Before long, you will be attacked by a boss-leveled draugr protecting the first of the opaque vessels. After the battle, claim the vessel and the quest will update with a new map marker. Backtrack to the previous room and follow the path unveiled behind the metal gate. The next chamber is divided into two levels, and several draugr will welcome you with open hostility as you enter. Dispose of them, cross the bridge and unlock the door on the other side for some minor loot and useful potions. The room to the northeast on the lower level contains a handle that opens a tunnel leading to a room you glimpsed earlier filled with some minor loot. Return to the two-leveled chamber and locate the eastern door, leading to the next zone, Valthume Catacombs. The Catacombs[edit] The Catacombs The first chamber of the catacombs features a chest in plain sight; when you open it, the attached tension cable will cause a giant frostbite spider to be released from above, along with several regular arachnids. Locate the eastern gate, pull the handle, and approach the catacomb area. Battle your way through the undead enemies and watch out for the pressure plate on the floor. Locate the gate in the northwestern part of the area and pull the chain in the alcove behind you. Face another leveled draugr and claim the second vessel from the pedestal. Before leaving, get rid of the soul gems on the small pedestals, for an easier exploration later. Locate the other exit from the catacombs and pass by the holes in the wall, now peaceful without the trapped soul gems. More catacombs await in the following area, guarded by even more draugr enemies, be also sure to watch out for a pressure plate and spike wall trap. Make your way to the gate and pull the chain. As you explore the next huge chamber, more enemies will burst out of their sarcophagi, so fight them, then find the stairs and walk down to the level below. Continue through the western path to an iron door, open it, and fight three frostbite spiders guarding the iron claw. As you lift the claw from the pedestal, the four flamethrower statues will all shoot at you, so head to the puzzle door and turn the rings as depicted on the iron claw: Dragon—Hawk—Wolf. Activate the keyhole and the gate will open, allowing access to the final room. The vessel is guarded by a boss-leveled draugr along with several leveled draugr, so prepare for the tough battle and claim the last opaque vessel. When you take it, the nearby iron gate will open and provide access to a word wall with a word for the Aura Whisper shout, along with a boss-leveled chest. It is time to return the three vessels to Valdar, so find the western gate for a quick shortcut back to Valthume. Raise the door bar and you will find Valdar waiting for you in the throne room. Hevnoraak[edit] ""Fools! You will not hold me here any longer, Valdar!"" When you return to Valdar with the three vessels, Valdar will congratulate you and explain their original purpose. The dragon priest used them to extract his blood, his goal being to resurrect himself after death to become an exceedingly powerful lich. Your task is to empty the vessels, thus making it impossible for the priest to regain his formidable powers. The ghost will point you towards the sconce in front of the throne, so head up there and fill the sconce with the blood from the vessels. The ritual also requires you to sit in the throne, so take a seat and witness Valdar's resurrection of the weakened Hevnoraak. As the ritual is completed, the dragon priest will burst out of his coffin and yell: ""Fools! You will not hold me here any longer, Valdar!"" Valdar will immediately seek shelter, and it is up to you to fight the powerful dragon priest. He will use his staff to cast walls of lightning towards you, which create a lasting shock damage effect. Dodge the powerful attack and corner the priest, then dispose of him as quickly as possible. When all is said and done, claim his staff and loot his dragon priest mask and a huge amount of gold from his remains. Valdar will thank you wholeheartedly, not only for saving Skyrim, but also for freeing him from his eternal duty as guardian inside Valthume. The ghost will then disappear and the quest will end."

Return to Neloth to report the side effects of his spell.","Neloth will request you help him with an experiment. Agree and he will cast an experimental spell on you, instructing you to report to him any side effects. The spell will endow you with 25 additional points of health. You can observe the status of the effect through the Active Effects section of your magic menu. The effect is permanent until you submerge yourself up to arm's length in water. Doing so will then cause a 25 point decrease to health permanently until you return to Neloth. Streams running through caves, and other shallow water regions should not affect this, nor should wading in shallow water for any period of time. It is therefore possible by carefully avoiding deep water to maintain this bonus for a significant period. By obtaining Ahzidal's Boots of Waterwalking during Unearthed this bonus can theoretically be maintained indefinitely, provided you manage to stay out of the rain (some players have reported that rain induces the negative effects). Returning to Neloth and reporting the negative effects will result in him removing the spell, which will set you back to normal. He will then reward you 250 gold regardless of your level."

He will then prepare and cast the spell. Tentacle Things[edit] You will be rendered blind for a short time, and your stamina will drain. In the dark, Neloth will speak to you, while a panicked Talvas Fathryon interjects: Talvas: ""Master Neloth! What have you done to him/her? What are those things growing out of his/her eyes?""   Neloth: ""Well that's unexpected. I presume you are blind, given the state of your eyes. It's nothing that can't be fixed. The spell that is. I think I can fix the spell.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Extracting_an_Argonian","Speak to the residents of Darkwater Crossing. Travel to Darkwater Pass. Search the cave for Derkeethus. Free Derkeethus from his prison. Escort Derkeethus out of the cave.","Darkwater Crossing[edit] If you talk to the residents of Darkwater Crossing (for example Sondas Drenim, a miner in nearby Goldenrock Mine), you will soon hear of an Argonian named Derkeethus who recently went to explore the pools around Darkwater - and who hasn't been seen in a long time. The residents will not be able to say for sure where Derkeethus is, but he has actually run into trouble inside Darkwater Pass. Locating Darkwater Pass can be difficult. The easiest route from Darkwater Crossing is to cross the bridge that spans the river to the southwest of the settlement. At the crossing, take the right path. Just before you reach the second bridge and Fort Amol, a stone marker to the left of the road will indicate a dusty path heading west up the mountainside. Follow the path as it curves sharply south, and onward through the trees along the cliff's edge. Eventually you will come to a large pool fed by three large waterfalls. Drop into the pool and turn directly around to the north - an iron door in the cliff wall in front of you leads to Darkwater Pass. Darkwater Pass[edit] Follow the low tunnel past an unlocked chest, and you will reach a small cavern. Watch out - a Falmer will drop out of a Falmer hive in the wall immediately to your right as you enter. Follow the path up into a larger cavern. A Falmer waits immediately ahead outside a tent, and yet another may drop from a hive above and to the left. In the north wall is an opening into a pillared chamber where three chaurus reside. Head past this chamber and up the stairs to reach a small room with a trap door in the center. Look down through the bars to see Derkeethus pacing about in his cell below. Be mindful of the Falmer in the adjoining room with an arcane enchanter (step in here and two more Falmer will drop from the hives up near the ceiling). Northeast from the center of the trap door, there is a lever on the wall. Pulling this lever lowers a section of wall, revealing a spiral staircase heading down. A corridor in the west wall leads south to a small circular room called Darkwater Pit. As soon as you approach, Derkeethus will engage you in conversation and ask you to help him escape. The Darkwater Pit Key is in the left Burial Urn just inside the gate, but the gate is the standard barred prison cell door with sufficient gaps to allow you to reach through and take the key from the burial urn. If he has lockpicks in his inventory, Derkeethus may have already escaped his cell and be waiting somewhere in the corridor. If this has happened, it may alert the Falmer in the arcane enchanter room. Although there is still more of Darkwater Pass to explore, the easiest way to get Derkeethus out is to head straight back the way you came - particularly as he will not crouch into a sneaking stance when you do during this quest, and there are some nasty traps and Falmer further up the cave. Once you have led Derkeethus to safety, he will thank you for saving him. You can now recruit him as a follower if you wish. If not, you can recruit him at any time from Darkwater Crossing."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Eye_of_Magnus","Breach the barrier around the college with the Staff of Magnus. Confront Ancano in the Hall of the Elements. Defeat Ancano with the help of the Staff of Magnus.","All Hell Has Broken Loose[edit] Firstly, you'll notice that when attempting to fast travel back to the College is that it no longer has a map marker. You'll need to travel directly to the town of Winterhold, then travel on foot the rest of the way. When arriving back at the College, you will see that all is not well. Tolfdir and the other college mages have been awaiting your return. A magical force field created by the Eye of Magnus now surrounds the college and Tolfdir will tell you of Mirabelle's death. Looking to Tolfdir for direction, he will say, ""You're the one with the staff, my dear/boy. If it can help us get inside the College, and reach Ancano, we'll have to hope there's a way to stop all this."" That is your cue to equip the staff of Magnus and lead the charge into the College. The Staff and The Eye[edit] Tolfdir tries to stop Ancano from activating the Eye of Magnus. Aim the staff at the barrier and it will dissipate, allowing safe passage into the College. The quest now is to get to the Hall of the Elements where Ancano is trying to activate the Eye of Magnus. Ancano will proclaim that he has the power to destroy the world at his fingertips, and that he cannot be stopped. He has become connected to the Eye at this point and absorbs more and more power from it. Tolfdir will cast a fire spell at Ancano, but to no avail. The Eye of Magnus at full power Tolfdir tells you to use the staff on the Eye. It will begin to crack open, then emit a blinding flash, and you will be briefly stunned. Both Tolfdir and your follower (if you have any) will be paralyzed and remain this way until Ancano is dead. When the Eye is fully open, it will spawn magic anomalies and Ancano will lose his connection with it. The Eye will emit a blinding light; after this happens, continue to use the staff on it until it fully closes again. Ancano is vulnerable at this time and he should be busy dealing with the magic anomalies. Start inflicting damage. If you take too long, Ancano may reopen the eye and become invulnerable again; in this case, simply repeat the procedure and he will eventually succumb. Tolfdir will assist in eliminating the anomalies. It is not recommended that the staff be used for battle, as it can quickly run out of charge. Fortunately, you can recharge it with the soul gems dropped by the magic anomalies, though the staff requires almost two grand soul gems' worth to fully recharge. The New Arch-Mage[edit] When Ancano is defeated, ask Tolfdir what you should do now. While he explains that he does not know how to contain the Eye, Quaranir, of the Psijic Order will appear.  Quaranir will congratulate you, telling you that you have met their expectations. He will assure you that the Psijic Order will safeguard the Eye, which might otherwise destroy the College along with the rest of the world. He will observe that the world is not ready for the Eye, as Ancano just demonstrated, and declare you the new Arch-Mage of the college. Two additional members of the Psijic Order will appear, surround the Eye, and then vanish in a glow of light, taking the Eye with them. Tolfdir will then affirm that you should be the new Arch-Mage, and give you the key to the Arch-Mage's Quarters and the Archmage's Robes."

Report Falion to the Jarl of Morthal.","The Guardian[edit] Falion is a master in Conjuration. While he enjoys the town of Morthal enough to set up a home and business, he seems ever wary of a lurking danger. His academic interests include vampirism and the undead; perhaps he is aware of more than he is letting on. The Suspicion[edit] If you inquire around Morthal about the wizard in town, you are told that he seems to be up to something; specifically, that he goes out into the marsh in the middle of the night.  A conversation with Agni, his ward and apprentice, reveals that she had a ""bad dream"" in which Falion went away and made ""monsters"" while she slept. Falion dismisses this as only a dream, and insists his talents are needed to ""keep the town safe"". Late Night Wanderings[edit] If you wait near Falion's house until 1am, you can follow him as he heads out of town, past the mill, and northwest into the marshes. He journeys to what appears to be a summoning circle. This is the same summoning circle where you must meet him to cure your vampirism in Rising at Dawn. Upon confronting him, he will demand that you leave him to his ""work"" and never speak to anyone about what you observed that night, although he won't reveal precisely what his work is. You can agree to keep quiet, or blackmail him for 200 gold. Regardless of your choice, you may then report him to the jarl if you so desire: Jarl  ""He's casting spells out in the marsh in the middle of the night.""  ""Never mind. It's not important.""   Idgrod Ravencrone  ""Ah, so it is not just dreams then. I have seen this. I will see that it is dealt with. Thank you for bringing clarity.""  ""I see. If something does happen, you know where I am.""   Sorli the Builder  ""Is that so? Well, I'll make sure that's taken care of immediately. It's good that you brought this to my attention.""  ""Either this is some kind of a joke, or you're keeping something from me. Whichever it is, I don't like it."" Reporting to the Jarl[edit] After reporting Falion to the jarl, she will immediately find and confront him, threatening dire consequences for Falion if he continues his actions. The scene differs depending on the current jarl - Sorli the Builder or Idgrod Ravencrone. Idgrod Ravencrone Sorli the Builder    Idgrod Ravencrone: ""Falion, I am disappointed."" Falion: ""What is the meaning of this?"" Idgrod: ""You've been exploring places you shouldn't, and you know it.""

This starts the quest Season Unending, which will now have to be completed before you can proceed with The Fallen. If the civil war has been settled for either the Imperials or the Stormcloaks, the jarl will allow you permission upon speaking with him. This option actually becomes possible once either side of the civil war controls at least eight of the nine Holds: if you have joined the Stormcloaks, you must have started or completed the ""Liberate Haafingar"" objective of Liberation of Skyrim; and if you have joined the Imperials, you must have started or completed the ""Regain Eastmarch"" objective of Reunification of Skyrim. If you choose to complete Paarthurnax by killing him before the peace negotiations, this will anger Arngeir to the point where he refuses to talk to you. However, he will still agree to host the negotiations and talk to you only for the duration of the quest. Arngeir will comment on the loss of Paarthurnax during his standoff with the Blades. Dragon Captive[edit] After the peace treaty negotiations have been completed (see the quest Season Unending for further details), you will learn that you can use a Shout to summon a dragon, as all dragon names are Words of Power. Esbern has uncovered the name of one dragon in their records, Odahviing. Upon telling you the name of the dragon, you will automatically learn a new Call Dragon shout. If you did not have to do Season Unending, you are instead sent to Paarthurnax, who provides you with the same information as Esbern, including the same Call Dragon shout. At the moment you learn the shout, your journal is updated to reflect Season Unending as complete, even if you had never actually started that quest. Go to Dragonsreach to prepare and spring the trap with the help of Jarl Balgruuf or Jarl Vignar Gray-Mane, depending on the current allegiance of Whiterun. The area you need to go is located behind the throne room and up the stairs (you can just follow the jarl). Tell the jarl you're ready, then use the Call Dragon shout by holding it down for a moment. Odahviing will appear after a short delay and attack, being curious to test your power. Fight him, and draw him closer to the doors you came in through using the shout Dragonrend. Climb the stairs that start near the doors, or simply back up towards the rear of the room, and a large wooden yoke will drop down and snap around his neck, holding him in place. You can then interrogate him and he will start talking to you. He will tell you where Alduin has gone; a former temple of the Dragon Cult called Skuldafn Temple. Interrogate him further and he will reveal to you that it is impossible to get to Skuldafn without wings, but he will take you if you release him, as he, like the other dragons, has begun to question whether Alduin is fit to lead after your earlier defeat of him. Before you accept his offer, make sure you have everything you need for a long mission, as you will not be able to leave Skuldafn until after you have completed the next three quests. You cannot take any followers with you to Skuldafn. When you are ready, talk to a guard on the upper level to release Odahviing. He will not fly away, so talk to the now-freed Odahviing for the flight to Skuldafn. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: The Fallen (20 points/Bronze)"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:A_False_Front_(Imperial)","Speak to Legate Rikke at the Pale Imperial Camp. Find a Stormcloak courier and take his documents. Take the documents back to Legate Rikke. Take the modified documents to Frorkmar Banner-Torn in Dawnstar. Return to Legate Rikke.","The Pale[edit] ""One way or another, get me those documents."" After successfully defending Whiterun on behalf of the Imperial Legion, the umbrella quest Reunification of Skyrim will start, as it is high time to conquer all remaining holds currently controlled by the Stormcloaks and once and for all rid Skyrim of Ulfric Stormcloak. Unless you used it for negotiations during Season Unending, your very first target will be to claim the Pale to the north. As General Tullius puts it: ""You'd be wasted as a regular soldier. I have special plans for you. You'll be of greater use to me with greater flexibility. Make your way to our hidden military camp in the Pale. Rikke will have important tasks for you, and will need you when we reclaim the capital."" When Tullius asks you to regain the Pale, your commander-in-chief Legate Rikke will relocate to the snowy Pale Imperial Camp east of hold capital Dawnstar. Rikke will be located in the easternmost tent, busy studying a huge regional map of Skyrim. When you report for duty she will let you in on her plan to conquer the Pale: ""I need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar. But first we need to get our hands on some rebel orders to make the forgeries."" She will then explain that a Stormcloak courier will travel back and forth between Candlehearth Hall in Ulfric's home city Windhelm, and Nightgate Inn, a remote inn between Dawnstar and Windhelm. She will then task you: ""See if you can't 'convince' one of those innkeepers to help you. One way or another, get me those documents. But don't do anything rash if you go to Windhelm."" Obviously, Rikke recommends the Nightgate Inn due to its remote location, but leaves the decision and strategy to you. The Stormcloak Courier[edit] Your first objective is to find the busy courier. He is quite hard to corner in the wilderness, as he will run back and forth between Candlehearth and Nightgate, and your map markers will only point to the taverns, making it hard to know where the courier is. You will have to either meet him by accident, or ask the innkeepers for his whereabouts. Some useful knowledge is displayed below: The courier will never stay long at the inns, and will leave soon after your arrival. The only settlement the courier passes through is Anga's Mill. It is possible to wait for the courier there and get the more accurate map marker. The courier owns the second room on the left inside both inns, and will reside there if he is present. The courier may be killed by wild animals or Viinturuth while travelling, so if he fails to show up after a while, you'll probably have to go out and look for him yourself. As an alternative to meeting the courier and getting the map marker by chance, you can follow Rikke's advice and ask the innkeepers. Both the innkeeper of Candlehearth Hall, Elda Early-Dawn, and Nightgate's Hadring have the same dialogue and they will have to be persuaded, bribed, or intimidated as they will both say: ""I tend to keep my patrons' privacy."" Note that you will need a Speech skill level of 50 or above to successfully persuade the innkeepers, and that you will always get your answer when intimidating, as it is not possible to fail: Option  Dialogue  Reaction   ""His life is in danger."" (Persuade) Passed: ""It is? Well that's different."" Failed: ""Yeah, sure it is. You don't fool me."" Passed: Map marker Failed: Nothing   ""Maybe some gold will help?"" (Bribe) Passed: ""Well, if you insist..."" Failed: ""Seems your purse is lighter than you thought."" Passed: Map marker Failed: Nothing   ""I don't have time for this... I can get rough with you if I have to."" (Intimidate) Passed: ""Now, now! That won't be necessary."" Passed: Map marker   ""Never mind."" ""Hmph."" Nothing When you have successfully finished the persuasion, both innkeepers will now say: ""He's in the inn. Look around. I'm sure you'll find him."", if the courier is present, or ""He was here, but he left. If you leave now, you can probably catch him. Or, you can just wait here. He'll be back soon enough."" Retrieve the Intelligence[edit] The courier attacks. Regardless of your method of locating the courier, the map marker will now point directly to him. Regardless of what you say, or what uniform you are wearing, the Stormcloak courier will not give up the documents without a fight, with the inevitable result. When you approach the courier, you will have no options but to say: ""I'm not here to talk. I'm here for those documents."", and the courier will respond: ""Is that so?"" or ""We'll see about that."" The courier will then proceed to attack, leading to his inevitable death. There is only one way to avoid bloodshed: Pickpocket the documents from the courier. This is easily done when the courier relaxes in his room at Candlehearth Hall, as no witnesses will be present. Killing the courier will always count as murder, even when done with no witnesses around (see Bugs section). However, there are a few ways to make the courier die: When he leaves an inn, follow him into the wilderness and wait for the wildlife to kill him. Insult him and make him follow you into the wilderness and locate some wildlife that can finish him off. Lastly, you can kill him yourself. The goal is to do it when no witnesses are around to avoid a bounty. The two methods above will always lead him into seclusion in the wilderness and work perfectly. Additionally, the courier can be stealthily killed inside his room at Candlehearth, especially if he decided to sleep. It goes without saying that Nightgate is the safest spot to achieve your goal, as Windhelm guards will be all over you if you cause a racket in their city. When the courier is dead, claim the documents from the body and head back to Legate Rikke in the camp. The Commander of Dawnstar[edit] Frorkmar Banner-Torn When you return to Legate Rikke and hand her the documents, she will immediately start forging the documents, saying: ""Very good... Let's see what you have here. Interesting... They know more of our plans than I expected... It would seem Fort Dunstad is in need of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those... One moment while I 'correct' some of these documents... That should do it. Make sure those forged documents get to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar. It'll throw him off our trail, allowing us to maneuver more freely."" When you arrive at Dawnstar, follow the map marker to Frorkmar Banner-Torn, who will most likely stand near the Skyrim map inside The White Hall. When you approach him, his dialogue will differ depending on your choice of armor. If you are wearing anything but Stormcloak armor, he will get suspicious: ""Is that so? I don't recognize you. Why aren't you wearing your Stormcloak colors?"" You will then have to tell him it is easier to sneak past the enemy without the uniform, and he will admit: ""I suppose it would be. Good thinking."" He will then continue on, saying the same thing as if you were wearing Stormcloak armor: ""All right. Let's take a look... Ah, good. Looks like the reinforcements for the fort are on the way. And we have some information about enemy troop movements as well. Excellent. It's not easy running messages, what with Imperials scouts crawling all over the place. Well done. Why don't you grab yourself a drink at the Windpeak before heading back?"" He then hands you 5 gold as a small token of his appreciation, and the quest will end. Back in the Pale Imperial Camp, Rikke will reward you with a leveled amount of gold. Inspired by the false information you gave to Frorkmar, she will brief you on your next mission: The Battle for Fort Dunstad. Reward[edit] Levels Reward   1–9 400   10–19 600   20–29 800   30–39 1,000   40+ 1,200"

He tells you that Dragon Bridge and Rorikstead are frequented often by Imperial couriers, and you should look in the inns of those places. Head to Rorikstead or Dragon Bridge and speak to the innkeeper in the local inn. To find out the courier's location, you must either persuade, bribe, or intimidate the innkeeper.

The innkeeper will then tell you that the courier just left, so you could go after them, or you can wait for the courier to come back. It's better to find the courier in the wilderness because you will get a bounty for killing them. The courier may be far from town, so you it might be better to wait for them to come back and then follow them out of the town. Once you find the courier, saying you want the documents will make the courier attack you immediately.You may also pickpocket the documents off of the courier. The courier may also get into a fight with Stormcloaks or wild animals. Stormcloaks and hostile bandits often frequent the courier's route. Delivering the documents[edit] Once you have the documents, head back to the Stormcloak camp and give them to Galmar. He will then forge false information and will then tell you to take them to the Legate in Morthal. Head to Morthal and enter the Highmoon Hall, the Legate is through the doorway, under the stairs, to the left. Talk to him and give him the documents, if you are not wearing a Legion uniform he will ask about it, but upon explaining yourself he will take the documents and give you five gold.

You are never told the name of the family who lost the item, only the hold in which they live. A fort inhabited by bandits The target location is randomly chosen from 76 possible locations, amounting to a large fraction of the dungeons that contain boss chests.  The location will be limited to holds that you have previously visited, so early in the game you may only receive destinations within Whiterun Hold, but later in the game there are many more possible destinations.  Possible types of locations are: A Bandit Camp or Bandit-Occupied Fort: 23 possible locations (Bandit Camps category) A Falmer Hive: 12 possible locations (Falmer Hives category) A Forsworn Camp: 7 possible locations (Forsworn Camps category) A Giant Camp: 12 possible locations  (Giant Camps category) A Vampire Lair: 8 possible locations  (Vampire Lairs category) A Warlock Lair: 15 possible locations (Warlock Lairs category) (Note that the provided categories list all locations with the given type of occupant, including locations that do not have a boss chest and therefore cannot be possible destinations for this quest).

It can be found just across the bridge south of Ivarstead, traveling southeast up the nearby hill. It is between Geirmund's Hall and Honeystrand Cave. Here you can find and loot the body of an Arena Fan to obtain the Arena Fan's Note, as well as a copy of The Crimson Dirks, v8. The book tells the tale of Urgnok, a former member of a gang of outlaws known as the Crimson Dirks, who left his life of crime and ascended to the rank of Bloodletter in the Imperial City Arena before being forced to flee north to Skyrim. The quest will start upon reading the fan's note which reveals that the fan attempted to meet with this ex-combatant before his untimely death. Urgnok is apparently fighting in the local underground pits and didn't take kindly to being tracked down. The note states that he was recently spotted living at the Ruins of Bthalft, a bandit camp to the south. Travel to Bthalft and you will find Urgnok living among the bandits. He will be easy to spot due to his full set of Dwarven Mail armor. Urgnok is hostile and will attack you on sight; kill him and take his armor to complete the quest.

Collect the products of the harvest in the pantry.","Farming[edit] Once you have completed The Unquiet Dead, Goldenhills Plantation is now yours. You will be given this quest to walk you through the various farming activities needed to get the place up and running. Your first step will be to plant 10 crops in any of the plots of Fertile Soil around the property. There are plenty of plots on the property, and you can change your selection of crops at a later date if you so choose. Once this is complete, you will be prompted to hire a personal steward. Many potential followers will be willing to work as your steward if you bring them to the farm. You can also move your spouse to Goldenhills and ask them to take over as steward instead. Stewardship[edit] With your choice of steward in place, the next step will be to hire some manual labor for the farm. You can speak to your steward about this and they will hire two generic farmhands. Alternatively, if you wish to provide your own hires, you can recruit Angrenor Once-Honored, Brenuin, Embry, or Narfi. Once you have hired two farmhands, you will be prompted to construct an animal pen. This will require you to use the Farmer's Workbench near the entrance to the farmhouse. There are several construction options available, but for the animal pens all you will need is three firewood and a set of nails. Build it and you will be prompted to purchase some livestock via your steward. They will arrange for the purchase of cows, goats, and chickens for the farm.

Follow Frea to the Temple's exit and towards the village. On the way she will tell you about the Wind Stone and how her people are working against their will. She notes hopefully that the magical barrier around Skaal Village still stands before heading into town. In the center of the village you will find Storn and town residents Nikulas and Finna in deep concentration, all of them maintaining the magical shield. Frea will rush right up to Storn and talk to him: ""Father! I have returned!"" Frea: ""Father! I have returned! There is yet hope!	"" Storn: ""Frea! What news do you bring? Is there a way to free our people?"" Frea: ""No, but I have brought someone who has seen things... He/She has confirmed that Miraak is indeed behind the suffering of our people.""

Frea: (to you) ""Please, tell Storn what has happened."" When talking to Storn, it becomes clear that creating the magical shield is weakening him and that time is short. He will also tell the tale of the Temple of Miraak and how dragons burned it to the ground in a huge battle long ago. Storn will conclude that dragons never managed to kill Miraak and that he has returned. He will shrewdly point out that you managed to see Miraak through the Black Book and will force you to admit being Dragonborn. He admits that he doesn't yet know whether you are meant to destroy or save his people. For now, he bids you go to Saering's Watch and learn the dragon word Miraak learned long ago, in hopes you will be able to break the spell cast upon the people of Solstheim. Saering's Watch[edit] Saering's Watch is the only  dragon lair on Solstheim and is located in the northern part of the island, between Castle Karstaag Caverns and Benkongerike. It is inhabited by several leveled draugr and a leveled dragon. The battle can be quite hard as the enemies tend to attack in groups, so approach with caution. When all is said and done, learn the first word for the shout Bend Will and claim the contents from the boss-leveled chest next to the word wall. For an easier fight you can approach from the top of the mountain, where the dragon will busy itself attacking the draugr and not you. You can kill the dragon with ranged attacks before dropping down to learn the Word of Power. Here in His Shrine[edit] Skaal villagers working on the Wind Stone Travel to the Wind Stone, which is located across the bridge west of Skaal Village. Seven Skaal villagers surround the Wind Stone, mindlessly performing a synchronized chant with Miraak as they build a structure around the shrine. Due to a bug, this is a good time to save your game. Use Bend Will on the Wind Stone to free the villagers and destroy the structure surrounding the Stone. As soon as you shout, the villagers will wake up from the trance and wander aimlessly around, claiming that they have just woken up from a nightmare. Before long, a dangerous lurker is released. Defeat it to make sure that the villagers are truly safe from harm and check the surroundings for any casualties. The villagers will then return to Skaal Village, as should you to report back to Storn. Back in the village, Storn has lifted the magical barrier and the inhabitants have returned to their daily duties. Storn will be waiting for you and greet you happily with, ""The air is different. We are safe, which means you have succeeded."" When you tell him that his people are free he will be pleased and name you an ally of the Skaal. For the next step in weakening Miraak, he will task you with cleansing the rest of the shrines all over Solsteim, thus starting the quest Cleansing the Stones. When you inform him that you need to stop Miraak, not just weaken him, he will order you to seek out knowledge on the Black Book you found in the Temple of Miraak. He advises you to visit Neloth, a wise dark elf living in Tel Mithryn who has recently visited Skaal Village and showed another Black Book to Storn. This ends the quest and starts The Path of Knowledge."

If you have started (or completed) the quest The Final Descent you can gather the only two harvested samples of jelly in Solstheim, specifically deep within Raven Rock Mine, on an alchemy lab. However, you will either need to visit an apothecary or go netch-hunting for the rest of the samples. The table below shows all fixed locations of the netch, which often reside in familial groups: The largest netch family Location Bulls Betties Calves   The river south of the silt strider 1 1 2   The coast near the Tel Mithryn graveyard 1  1   Near Hrodulf's corpse 1 1 1   North of Hrodulf's House 1 1 2   The waterfall north of the Water Stone 1 2 3   Off the coast from Haknir's chest 1 1 1   Inside Coldcinder Cave  1 2  Once you have gathered five samples of netch jelly, return to Milore and hand them over. She will be impressed and say, ""Goodness, it must have been quite difficult tracking those creatures down out there. Here, take these. They should help you during your journeys."" She will then hand you two Potions of Ultimate Well-Being, ending the quest."

Return them to Ingun.","The Black Sheep[edit] Ingun Black-Briar has fallen far from the Black-Briar tree. Instead of learning the family business with her brother, Sibbi, she can be found devising alchemical recipes in Elgrim's Elixirs. The quality of her experiments seem to indicate a dark nature in this well-to-do girl, as she will allude to when speaking to her. Indeed, the ingredients she has depleted from Elgrim's stores are used to make some very powerful poisons. Helping Out[edit] Whether you speak to Ingun in Elgrim's Elixirs or find her walking through Riften, rouse her from her musings and ask her if she is an alchemist. She will reply: ""I'm aspiring to earn that title, yes. However, the road ahead is paved with loose cobbles and deadly pitfalls. Master Elgrim says I'm a natural; that I have a unique talent. But I fear his approval masks his intolerance for my mistakes. My errant formulas have cost Master Elgrim a fortune in ingredients; some of which are almost irreplaceable."" You are a helpful sort, so ask: ""What sort of ingredients do you need?"" Ingun will tell you: ""To restore Master Elgrim's supply I would need 20 deathbell, 20 nightshade and 20 nirnroot. Am I sensing that you may be interested in gathering these rare ingredients for me?"" Answer in the affirmative. Ingun will be pleased: ""That means more time for my experiments and less time in the field. Much appreciated."" Notable Harvest Locations[edit] Ingun needs you to hunt down 20 Deathbells, 20 Nirnroot, and 20 Nightshade. Deathbell  Grows in the salt marshes of Hjaalmarch and Haafingar, including a number of specimens in both Morthal and Solitude. Planted specimens can be found in the Honeyside and Alchemist's Shack gardens, as well as Shalidor's Maze in Labyrinthian. They also grow near each city's Hall of the Dead or graveyard. Finally, you can cultivate this plant, if you have a garden or farm.   Nirnroot  Grows near water anywhere. You can collect 9 samples from Sarethi Farm, which is close to Riften. See the Nirnroot distribution map to find the closest samples.   Nightshade  Grows in places of death. Check the cemeteries at Riften, Falkreath, and Solitude. Also check Hamvir's Rest and outside the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary west of Falkreath. Finally, you can cultivate this plant, if you have a garden or farm. Reward[edit] Ingun will reward you with leveled amount of gold (listed in the table below) for each set of ingredients brought to her. Levels Reward   1–9 250   10–19 400   20–29 500   30–39 600   40+ 750 After you have delivered and been paid for all three samples, it will behoove you to see what else you can procure from her. Hint to her: ""That was the last of the ingredients."" To which she will reply: ""Yes, Master Elgrim will be pleased I've restored his stock of these rare ingredients. I feel I owe a bit more than some meaningless coin for all your diligence. Here, this key unlocks my supply chest at Elgrim's Elixirs. Feel free to take what you need from time to time. I'll be refilling it once every few days or so."" The chest is found in the back of Elgrim's Elixirs, and she will restock it with 2 - 5 random leveled potions every few days."

You can find her working there all day long. As a frequent visitor to the tavern, Ranmir isn't so welcome. Haran may complain to her husband: ""How long are we going to let Ranmir drink himself into a stupor? When will enough be enough?"" If you talk to her about Ranmir, she will tell you ""Ranmir beg a drink from you, yet? That's gold wasted, friend."" Although she can understand he's had some troubles in his life, she can't have him drinking here without at least paying back some of the coin he owes. Ranmir spends almost all his days drinking right in the tavern, explaining ""Nothing to do here but drink till you forget you got nothing to do.""

Iddra and Roggi Knot-Beard[edit] Iddra is the innkeeper of the Braidwood Inn in Kynesgrove. She thinks highly of Roggi Knot-Beard as a storyteller and comments that he can keep everyone's spirits up. Although he owes Iddra a lot of coin for drinks, she keeps telling him not to worry about it. However, his ""stubborn Nord blood"" doesn't allow him to do so. She will eventually tell you ""Damn fool doesn't have the coin to pay me back, so he just beats himself up over it, and then he gets thirsty, and it cycles all over again."" If you can talk to Roggi, she'd feel better. Roggi is a miner and he can be found inside Braidwood Inn or in the mining camp nearby. If you tell him to forget about all the coin he owes, he will get a little angry: ""What do you think I am, a beggar? My family has always paid back every single coin we owed, going back to Tiber Septim's time."" You need to choose between three options and must pass an easy Speech check to persuade him.

Octieve San and Irnskar Ironhand[edit] Octieve San is an old warrior living in Solitude, frequently found in The Winking Skeever. As an elder, he enjoys his current life a lot: ""Being old's not so bad. Daughter keeps me fed, and my working days are done."" If you talk to him, he will tell you something annoying behind his relaxed life: ""Take my advice. Never gamble. Damn Irnskar has me in debt up to the eyes."" Too many drinking games, too many bets, and he is too old to ever raise the coin on his own. You may talk to Irnskar and give this old man a hand. Find Irnskar and talk to him about forgiving Octieve's debts. He will insist, ""Debts are debts. Either he pays them, or his kind do."" Then you will have three options for him. In order to persuade him, you must pass an easy Speech check. Option  Dialogue  Reaction   He's an old man. Let it go. (Persuade) Passed: Fine. You sound like a priest of Mara, but I get your point.

Omluag and Mulush gro-Shugurz[edit] Omluag lives in The Warrens and works at the smelter in Markarth. You may also find him in Silver-Blood Inn, enjoying some free time after a whole day's work. During his work, he will often say, ""Can't talk. Mulush will beat me if I stop working."" If you are interested in his trouble with Mulush, talk to him and he will tell you, ""He's a damn tyrant. Always being goaded on by the Silver-Bloods to get more work out of us. They pay us next to nothing. We get beaten if we make a mistake, and where are our kind Nord rulers? What are they doing? Typical."" If you are willing to talk to Mulush, he will be a little surprised: ""You're going to try to talk sense into that Orc? I'll believe it when I see it."" You can find Mulush right near his workers, monitoring their work. If you talk to him, he will realize you're not one of his workers and ask your business here. You can ask him to leave Omluag alone. He will only give you a series of questions: ""What? Are you telling me how to treat my workers? Do you have any idea how much metal the Silver-Blood family wants us to smelt?"" You can then choose between three options to reach your goal. You must pass an easy Speech check to persuade this smelter overseer. Option  Dialogue  Reaction   You're working him to death. Lay off. (Persuade) Passed: All right, all right. You sound like a damn Legion officer, but I get it. I'll give him a break. This better not hurt our quota.Failed: I'm in charge of the smelter. Not you. So why don't you lay off? Passed: Return to OmluagFailed: Nothing   Maybe we can come to an understanding. (Bribe) Passed: I guess I can spare him a few beatings. Deal.Failed: The only thing I understand is you bothering you. Passed: Return to OmluagFailed: Nothing   Then we do this the hard way. (Brawl) Passed: Wait. You win. I'll ease off on the beatings, just leave me alone. Brawl: (Start a brawl) Victory: Damn outsider. Why couldn't you just mind your own business? Leave Omluag alone. This is my final warning. All right. I'll lay off him. Just leave. Failure: (Nothing)  Passed: Return to OmluagFailed: Brawl   Fine. Forget I asked. Idiot. Nothing Tell Omluag that you convinced Mulush to ease up a bit. He will be very excited and give his a week's wages to you as your payment. ""I don't believe it. Someone sticking up for us.""

He and his clansmen can be seen working around the Windhelm docks. Although race prejudice is quite common in this city, he wishes the Nords, Argonians and Dunmer here got along better. If you talk to him about his trouble, he will tell you something about their boss, Torbjorn Shatter-Shield. He wants everything for nothing and clings to every septim. ""He says an Argonian's labor is only worth a tenth of a 'proper Nord worker.' My people are not slaves!"" They have no chance to negotiate with him themselves, but you may try to talk to Torbjorn for him. You can find Torbjorn in the city, staying in his house or drinking at Candlehearth Hall. You can ask him to pay the Argonians a fair wage. If you have done him a favor before, by either bringing him an Amulet of Arkay or an alcoholic drink, he will listen to you: ""Well, my friend, if you think those boots needs more coin, I'll make it happen. But I'm doing this for you, not them."" Otherwise, he will refuse without hesitation: ""Those boots aren't worth the septims I do pay them. I'm not giving them coin I could give to good, Nord workers."" Then you may choose between three options to change his mind.  You must pass an easy Speech check to persuade him. Option  Dialogue  Reaction   They'll work harder if you pay them more. (Persuade) Passed: Bold words, but true. Fine, you win. I'll pay the Argonians more coin.Failed: They don't work now. Why should I waste more money? Passed: Return to ScoutsFailed: Nothing   What if I invest in their future? (Bribe) Passed: Paying the wages yourself? Well, I won't say no to gold. By my family's honor, this money will go to the Argonian workers.Failed: What future? Passed: Return to ScoutsFailed: Nothing   Pay them, or things will get ugly. (Intimidate) Passed: Easy. Maybe I was being too harsh on them. By the honor of Clan Shatter-Shield, they will be paid fairly. You have my word. Brawl: (Start a brawl) Victory: Damn boot-lover. You pay those Argonians fairly, or else. I yield. By the honor of Clan Shatter-Shield, the Argonians will be paid as much as any other worker. Failure: (Nothing)  Passed: Return to ScoutsFailed: Brawl   Fine. Forget I asked. That's what I thought. Nothing Return to Scouts-Many-Marshes with the good news and he will be impressed. For your help, he will then give you either two fortify-skill potions or three restoration potions that he was saving."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Final_Descent","Speak to Crescius Caerellius. Find out what the East Empire Company sealed away. Retrieve Gratian Caerellius's journal. Escape Bloodskal Barrow. Return to Crescius Caerellius.","Discouraged[edit] Once a prosperous East Empire Company mining outpost, Raven Rock's plummet has been a striking one. Now a House Redoran colony, the settlement is virtually forgotten by all except its handful of bleak residents—most of whom lost their jobs when the local mine was depleted. You'll hear the gloomy residents talking about their frustrations openly, and this mood persists even after freeing the citizens slaving for Miraak during Cleansing the Stones. Councilor Lleril Morvayn will put words on the problem: ""It used to be one of the richest ebony mines in Morrowind, but it dried out years ago. Now, we're barely holding on out here. Without the mine, Raven Rock doesn't feel like it can last much longer."" The Conspiracy[edit] 80-year-old ex-miner Crescius Caerellius is in agreement with Councilor Morvayn's observations, although he suspects the closing of the mine to be caused by more than just lack of ebony ore. When you visit Raven Rock Mine, you will find the aging miner in heavy discussion with his concerned wife Aphia: ""Damn it, woman! I said to leave me be!"" Crescius: ""Damn it, woman! I said to leave me be!"" Aphia: ""Crescius, last time you explored the mine you almost fell to your death. I'm not spending the rest of my days as a widow!"" Crescius: ""And I'm telling you that I'll do whatever it takes to find my great-grandfather's remains. He's down here, I can feel it."" Aphia: ""That was almost two centuries ago. There may be nothing left to find."" Crescius: ""Just let me go, woman!"" Aphia: ""Crescius, you're an obstinate old fool and you're going to get yourself killed."" After the discussion, ask either of them about what they were arguing about, although Crescius will be the one to start the quest. All three available options will lead him to say, ""But mark my words, these mines hold a secret that could put Raven Rock back on the map."" When asked to elaborate he reveals his conspiracy theory: ""A secret the East Empire Company swept under the rug two centuries ago. It killed my great-grandfather, and left Raven Rock with a worthless and tainted mine."" He will then tell you about his great-grandfather Gratian Caerellius, who used to be an explorer for the East Empire Company. He died in Raven Rock Mine almost 200 years ago, due to a 'rockfall' according to the company, but Crescius claims to know better. As it turns out, he recently found some of Gratian's old stuff, including a key and an unsent letter to the company, concerning a strange discovery inside the mine. After Gratian supposedly died from the rockfall, the company locked off a certain section of the mine in the process of drying it out. Crescius is therefore convinced that the company keeps something hidden in the depths and will hand you the key to what he believes is the forbidden section of the mine, along with the letter sent to his great-grandfather by the East Empire Company. During his trek through the mine, Gratian kept a detailed journal and you will soon find that you are following in his footsteps: ""Received a letter from the East Empire Company today. They say that some of the miners broke through the wall in shaft three of Raven Rock Mine and found some ruins."" Into the Depths[edit] What's behind the door? Make your way down the narrow ladder into the mine. The fall in the center of the room is a long one, so take great care to stay on the path. Make your way slowly down to the first huge ledge and fight a frostbite spider and a skeever. From the ledge, two paths are available. The tunnel leads to a dead end with yet another angry spider, so proceed down the woodworks and find the tunnel to the northwest, past several crates and barrels with the East Empire Company logo, as well as some flammable gas and more spiders. Knock down the wood planks blocking the path and claim the contents of the East Empire Company strongbox near the iron gate. Unlock the gate with the key and proceed forward to discover what the East Empire Company tried to hide, namely a crypt full of draugr; three of them will awaken from their slumber and attack. Proceed forward, avoiding the spike wall trap on the way, and deal with the numerous leveled draugr in the next chamber. Make sure to prepare yourself before entering the room with the metal grate floor, as there are eight draugr seated on thrones around the walls of this room, at least five of which are still active. If your Lockpicking skills are good, unlock the master-level lock on the boss chest in one of the alcoves, then proceed through the iron door to the west. You will arrive in a chamber with two draugr resting on thrones, an alchemy lab, a stalhrim deposit, and several ingredients scattered around. Between the two thrones there you will find a potion of waterwalking - the first of four in the entire game which can be found solely within this mine. Use caution as you approach the northern tunnel, as there are two spellcaster traps at the top of the incline which will shoot lightning bolts at you.  Finally, open the iron door at the end. ""Looks like the miners broke right through the wall of an old Nordic barrow. I've seen this sort of thing in Skyrim before... damn Nords have barrows dotting the landscape and almost none of them are ever marked on any maps."" Walk of the Dead[edit] The next chamber is huge and in multiple levels. Prepare for another hard fight against several draugr enemies, including two deathlords that you will have to fight while another draugr shoots arrows at you from afar. Note that these two are always deathlords carrying ebony weapons, regardless of your level. Keep an eye on your health at all times and proceed forward carefully while taking care of the first deathlord, then rush up the slopes to the overhanging bridge and dispose of the next one and the archer. At this point, you can backtrack to the bottom of the room and find a locked entrance behind the waterfall leading to a small section of the upcoming area Bloodskal Barrow, which contains another deposit of stalhrim. Return to the bridge in the previous zone and unlock the chest underneath the arcane enchanter for some minor loot. The second potion of waterwalking is on the floor just to the right of the chest. When you are finished, activate the handle adjacent to the enchanter. This raises the iron gate to the south. Take a left for a copy of the spell tome for Ice Spike and look above it for a spell trap soul gem and knock it down before going to the woodworks to the west, there is a locked chest with minor loot behind the stairs at the base, walk around the pillar to find it.  Then proceed up the woodworks to the west. At the top you will face the spellcaster trap if you didn't knock the off its pedestal in the Ice Spike Tome room.  Directly behind the pedestal is a hidden room with some minor loot with a chain to open it to the left behind webs. Make your way to another bridge, a long way above the waterfall, and watch out for several dart trap-triggering pressure plates on the other side. The locked chest to the north only contains minor loot. Locate the narrow passageway next to the pressure plate and follow it as it twists and turns, then uncover the second huge secret of the mine: ""It's been an astonishing day of discovery! After exploring the large chamber beyond the dropoff, I was startled to find the strangest weapon I've ever laid eyes upon sitting on a pedestal of sorts. The blade appears to be flawless, and is emitting a faint chilling glow."" Gratian Caerellius[edit] ""I'm afraid this tomb will become my resting place."" A huge chamber opens before you with two waterfalls leading into a stream that disappears underground. Jump down carefully from ledge to ledge to avoid too great a fall. The area has several dead draugr and at the end of the stream where it disappears underground is a minor chest. The skeletal remains of Millius lie at the foot of the stairs leading to the huge round door with strange carvings, and the remains of Gratian Caerellius lie in a pool of blood closer to the round door, seemingly ripped apart postmortem. Examine the bones and you will find Gratian's Journal with its in-depth description of the failed expedition and how they were ultimately attacked by draugr, along with the unique, valuable Bloodskal Blade, which releases energy blasts when using power attacks. Claim his journal and sword, as both are necessary for the quest to advance. Read through the journal for Gratian's 200-year-old theories on how to solve the puzzle: ""I'm fairly certain that the key to the door involves the use of the Bloodskal Blade. When swinging the weapon, I'm noticing a ribbon of mystical energy emanating from it. I think by swinging the sword in different directions, it's possible to manipulate this ribbon and solve whatever puzzle this door presents."" Solving the Puzzle[edit] Stand at a distance facing the door. You will see a bright red horizontal line on either side of the door that seems to be pulsating. Choose one of the lines. Line your cross-hairs up directly with the pulsating red line. Begin moving to the left or right in line with the bright red light and hold in the trigger in order to do a horizontal power attack and send a blast of energy at the line. (This will not work if you are sneaking). A section of the wall around the door will recede back into the archway and a new section will take its place, revealing a new pulsating red line, this time a vertical one. Line your cross-hairs up and, remaining stationary, send a vertical power attack at it. Once you've activated all the lines around the archway as they appear (the order doesn't matter), a final vertical gash will appear illuminated down the center of the door. Unfortunately, the wounded Gratian never mustered the strength to solve the puzzle and the last entry of his journal reads: ""I've lost track of time and my strength is fading. I can't even stand anymore. My wounds refuse to heal. I'm afraid this tomb will become my resting place. If anyone finds this journal, please send these notes to my superiors at the East Empire Company and tell my wife that I love her."" Zahkriisos[edit] Zahkriisos The door opens into a hall riddled with swinging blade traps. At the end of the hall is a lever that opens the gate in front of you, revealing yet another large chamber. The blades are proximity triggered, so if your follower isn't essential they will likely be killed passing through, as there is no way to disable the traps. This one is partially flooded and with a tempting chest on a ledge. As you move eastward in the room, whether on the chest ledge or along the edges of the water, the dragon priest Zahkriisos will emerge from the middle of the pond about halfway between the chest and the word wall at the eastern end of the room. He will immediately attack you. In addition to being able to conjure Seekers from Apocrypha, Zahkriisos excels at lightning-based magic, so much so that at a high enough level, he can dual-cast Lightning Storm—a master-level spell—along with Thunderbolt. He also knows the spells Greater Ward and Ebonyflesh. Pick the fight with the strong boss and, when all is said and done, claim his mask and a boss-leveled amount of gold. Then turn your attention to the word wall at the east end of the room, which teaches you a word for the Dragon Aspect shout. Turn around and locate the newly revealed chamber to the right of the entrance. Within you will find a boss-leveled chest and the Black Book, The Winds of Change, upon a pedestal. By reading it you will enter Apocrypha and begin its associated quest. (You do not have to defeat Zakriisos to escape the mine. He can be avoided completely by heading directly left after entering the word wall chamber and turning left into the Black Book room. You will not be able to approach the word wall without triggering his emergence, but if you have a high Sneak skill there is a chance he will not detect you. Reading the Black Book is also not required to escape, and it will be there if you return later.) Escape Bloodskal Barrow[edit] Behind the Black Book is a wooden spiral ramp leading up to a door which takes you right into Bloodskal Barrow, a small lair inhabited by reavers. Head through the first tunnel and activate the chain to make the rock wall disappear, then sneak into the room. One reaver may be using the alchemy lab in the opposite corner and the boss will be watching the cooking pot in the center, giving you the opportunity for a sneak attack. Dispose of them all and make sure to locate the chest near the beds in the northwestern area, along with the rare book Deathbrand which adds a map marker for Haknir's Shoal at level 36 or higher. A crypt lies to the west and is guarded by another reaver, so defeat him and make your way through the spooky surroundings until you finally reach a door leading out to a mountaintop in Solstheim, a long way north of the original mine entrance back in Raven Rock. A New Beginning[edit] ""I've been made the foreman of the mine thanks to everything you did down there."" Dispose of the many reavers outside the Bloodskal Barrow entrance and search the area for treasure. Travel back to Raven Rock and find old Crescius Caerellius, who has left the mine and picked up his old routine again. When you tell him that he was right all along and hand him his great-grandfather's journal, he will be overwhelmed with joy: ""Let me see that! Ha, I knew it! Gratian's death wasn't because of a rockfall, it was just a story to keep people away from the tombs. Now that I have his journal in hand, I can get some closure from the East Empire Company. Make them pay for lying to everyone."" When you wish him the best of luck he will say: ""Thank you. Now, I believe I owe you a little more than a debt of gratitude for all that work you did. Here... it's not much, but it's the best an old, retired miner can do."" He will then hand you a small amount of leveled gold as reward. After the quest is finished, Raven Rock will improve remarkably and start flourishing again as a mining town. Several people will start working the mine on a daily basis, Crescius included as the new foreman, and the mine itself will see four new inhabitants working there around the clock. A few new sections of the mine will also open up and you can now mine for ebony. Lastly, even Councilor Lleril Morvayn will be grateful and name you a citizen of Raven Rock with: ""Your contributions have earned you citizenship here, friend. I'll always consider you one of us."" When asked about what the reopening of the mine means to Raven Rock, he will say the following: ""With the mines open, Raven Rock has become a significant colony of the Dunmer people again. I've been able to convince my superiors at House Redoran to send me the resources they've been denying now that we're deemed more important. Soon, we'll have a steady supply of workers and materials to keep things going for years to come."" Additionally, almost the entire population of Raven Rock will comment on the reopened mine and the many benefits: Name Reply   Adril Arano ""You might think it's all perfume and roses now that the mine's open, but all I see is a new security problem on our hands. Making sure those shipments of ebony make it safely from the mine to the shipping docks is my new order of the day. And with Solstheim crawling with reavers and Azura-knows what else, I can't risk any attacks on Raven Rock.""   Bralsa Drel ""Couldn't be better. The sections that are being opened up have revealed some huge deposits of ebony. Old Crescius has a nose for exactly where to dig. If they'd only listened to him years ago, the town wouldn't have been in such dire straits. At this rate, I'll be able to put a roof over my head in just a few months.""   Captain Veleth ""I've had to muster some more men to protect the mine, but I don't really have a problem with that. Second Councilor Arano is concerned that once word reaches the reavers that the mine has reopened, they might think about paying us a visit. I say let them try. My men are ready for them.""   Crescius Caerellius ""I've been made the foreman of the mine thanks to everything you did down there. It's good to get the old nose working again. I missed sniffing out the ebony deposits and getting my hands dirty. Best of all, Aphia isn't so cross when I go down there any more!""   Fethis Alor ""Things are picking up... for now. All I'm wondering is how long it'll take for House Redoran to begin ignoring us again if the mine runs out of ore for a second time.""   Geldis Sadri ""How do you think? It's a blessing. I've got regular paying customers again, thirsty workers at the end of the day, and more coin than I can count.""   Glover Mallory ""I've always had a steady stream of work thanks to the Redoran Guard, so it hasn't affected me much. However, I've seen the smile on people's faces and there's hope around here once again... something we've been lacking for a long time.""   Lleril Morvayn ""With the mines open, Raven Rock has become a significant colony of the Dunmer people again. I've been able to convince my superiors at House Redoran to send me the resources they've been denying now that we're deemed more important. Soon, we'll have a steady supply of workers and materials to keep things going for years to come.""   Rirns Llervu ""Bralsa's been nice enough to show me how to swing a pickaxe. She's an old hat when it comes to digging up ebony. I may not be an expert at it yet, but it's good to be back to work and have some coin in my pockets."""

(Optional) Track down and tame all seven wild horses.","Horse Tamer[edit] Upon reading Soran's Journal located on Urag gro-Shub's desk in the Arcanaeum, this quest will automatically begin and will direct you to the nearest stables.[verification needed — how is this selected?] You will need to speak with the hostler, i.e. the NPC who sells horses. (NOTE: I received the opportunity at the Whiterun Stables in a new game to buy the map without performing any of the actions previously outlined.) You will be presented with the option to purchase a wild horse map for 250 gold. You will receive both a Map of Wild Horses and a book called Wild Horse Notes. In conjunction with reading the book, the map can be examined in your inventory in order to locate seven wild horses. Upon making this purchase, this quest will conclude. However, you will then receive seven miscellaneous objectives tasking you with locating and taming every wild horse. The objectives themselves are rather useless as they do not provide a map marker for the individual horses. Instead, you will need to use the map and book to travel to the approximate location and search for the horse. The book itself advises that Detect Life will be useful in carrying out this task. Note that wild horses will flee if you get too close, so it may help to sneak up on them. To tame a wild horse, you must remain mounted on the horse while it bucks. It has a chance to ragdoll you when bucking, which will force you to chase down the fleeing horse once you get back on your feet. Sneaking can help prevent the horse from fleeing too far. Once mounted for a sufficient length of time, the horse becomes an owned mount. If you switch to a different mount, it will slowly make its way back to the location you originally found it. Find and tame the Black Horse[edit] This horse can be found northwest of Falkreath, just south of the map marker for Evergreen Grove. The book refers to nearby ruins, the ruins in question being Cracked Tusk Keep. This location is close to a necromancer's ritual site, and the resident necromancer might interrupt the taming process if you get too close. Find and tame the Chestnut Horse[edit] This horse can be found east of Helgen, along the path leading towards Falkreath Stormcloak Camp. It's off of the north side of the road, just under halfway from Helgen to the Falkreath Stormcloak Camp. Find and tame the Dapple Brown Horse[edit] This horse can be found in the forest south of Solitude Sawmill, across the river but before you reach the dragon mound. This can obviously be a dangerous place to tame a horse if the dragon is still nearby. Find and tame the Grey Spotted Horse[edit] This horse can be found up the hill to the north of Salvius Farm. Beware the nearby sabre cats who will attack you and the horse if you get too close. Find and tame the Pale Mare[edit] This horse can be found among a group of snowy pines just south of Yngol Barrow. Find and tame the Red Horse[edit] This horse can be found on the plains of Whiterun Hold, northwest of Whiterun Stables.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Find_the_Thalmor_Assassin","Talk to Malborn after the quest Diplomatic Immunity. Locate the Khajiits. Speak to Ri'saad. Kill the assassin. Return to Malborn.","An Old Friend[edit] If you manage to get Malborn out of the Thalmor Embassy alive during Diplomatic Immunity, after the end of that quest, he will run all the way to Windhelm seeking shelter in the New Gnisis Cornerclub, a Dunmer tavern located in the Gray Quarter. If you used Brelas as a distraction during that quest, she will be nearby (see Bugs). Upon your next visit anywhere near the city of Windhelm a hidden timer of 1 in-game day starts, so be sure to receive and complete this quest fast. Approaching Malborn in the New Gnisis Corneclub will have him explain his situation: due to his treachery, he is obviously blacklisted by the Thalmor so he has decided to flee to Morrowind; however, every time he tries to sneak out of Windhelm, he sees a suspicious Khajiit outside the gates. Convinced that the Thalmor have sent an assassin to kill him, and still blaming you and Delphine for putting him in a tight spot, the scared Malborn is now stuck in the Cornerclub and will request your assistance to get him to safety. An assassin waits for his prey outside Windhelm A Stranger in Their Midst[edit] Malborn will not provide a description of the alleged Khajiit assassin, saying only that he is standing outside the city gates. Your map marker will disappear when you exit Windhelm, so cross the bridge and make your way to the Windhelm Stables where the Khajiit caravan usually camps (it is not guaranteed it will be there as its schedule may led it elsewhere). In any case there will always be at least one Khajiit named J'datharr, who will stand apart from the others, and, if you haven't let the hidden timer run-out yet, Ri'saad and his caravan members, way off from their usual route. To unmask the real assassin speak to them, as they will have no specific dialogue cue except for Ri'saad: I'm looking for a Khajiit... might be a Thalmor spy. ""Ah. You must mean that one over there. He's not one of us. Thalmor filth, eh? Giving all Khajiit a bad name."" Doing so will allow you to confront the stranger in dialogue. When approached, J'datharr will initially try to brush you off, but upon hearing that you have a message from Malborn, he'll reply with: ""Malborn? Ah... very good. I think we understand each other."" and become hostile. The Khajiiti caravanners will not intervene on either side, so it's a simple duel to the death. After the fight, you can loot his body to find J'datharr's Note, obviously written by the Thalmor. Lastly, return to New Gnisis Cornerclub to tell Malborn the good news. He will be grateful and will reward you with some of the gold he stole from the Thalmor. He will then leave Windhelm, running towards the safety of Morrowind. If Brelas was with him, she will follow.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Finn%27s_Lute","Talk to Inge Six Fingers. Locate Finn's Lute in Stony Creek Cave. Return for your reward of a 1-point increase to all Stealth skills.","A Unique Lute[edit] Right after the Burning of King Olaf ends the quest Tending the Flames, talking to the otherwise authoritarian Inge Six Fingers will be somewhat wistful. When asked, she will tell you that a year ago, thieves broke into the College and stole her most precious item: the very first eight course lute ever created, namely Finn's Lute. As the Dean of Lute, Inge has been devastated ever since, but recently learned the location of the thieves, specifically Stony Creek Cave, a cave in southeastern Eastmarch. Stony Creek Cave[edit] A small pond hides the entrance to the cave, complete with a dock and a boat. Upon entering, the sight of a waterfall and a dead Breton hanging from a tree trunk hints at things to come. Follow the only available path upstream and fight the expected bandits trying to protect their treasure. When the path splits in two, head right and beware of the swinging mace trap right before the chamber with the bandit leader. Pick the fight and search the body for Treasure Map X, then look around the area for interesting items, including a copy of the Illusion skill book Mystery of Talara, Part 4, an unusual gem, along with a few ingredients and an alchemy lab. Finally, open the chest and claim the lute and some valuable loot. An Unexpected Lesson[edit] Before exiting the cave, it is possible to investigate the rest of the cave which will net you another fight against a bandit, along with a locked treasure chest, two moonstone veins and a waterfall hiding a shortcut from Kagrenzel. Exit the mine the way you came and return to the Bards College. Back at the College, Inge Six Fingers will be overwhelmed with joy. As she is unable to pay what the lute is worth, she will instead teach you a few tricks she has picked up over the years, and raise each of your Stealth skills by one point. This includes Alchemy, Light Armor, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Sneak, and Speech."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:First_Edition","Speak to Cindiri Arano in Raven Rock. Retrieve the Lusty Argonian Maid Folio. Return the folio to Cindiri.","A Precious Heirloom[edit] The biggest bookstore in Cyrodiil is called First Edition and is located in the Market District of the capital of Cyrodiil, the Imperial City. The bookstore is famous for its various limited editions of numerous rare books and also delivers to citizens outside of Cyrodiil, for example to Cindiri Arano in Raven Rock. Once you have freed Cindiri from Miraak's spell, she will greet you with: ""You look able enough to venture outside of town. Perhaps you could help me recover something precious that was lost?"" When asked to elaborate she will explain that she had an important folio rebound at the First Edition bookstore. Unfortunately, the folio never made its way back to Raven Rock. When you ask her if it was aboard a ship she will say: ""Yes, the ""Strident Squall"" or something like that. The damn thing sunk right off the coast of Solstheim. Can you imagine?"" She then explains that one of the sailors managed to crawl back to Raven Rock and tell the guards about the wreckage. When you offer to locate the folio for her, she will be grateful and even refer to it as a 'precious heirloom' to the family. The Strident Squall[edit] You will not receive a map marker, nor will any citizens help you find the wreck. However, the Wreck of the Strident Squall is clearly visible on your map, at the southwestern tip of Solstheim. Travel to the wreck and fight five leveled reavers, including a Reaver Lord; one sits on a chair on the ground while the remaining four will shoot at you from the deck. When the coast is clear examine the ship for several valuable items, including an East Empire Company strongbox containing an East Empire Pendant on some shelves below deck. Go behind the stairs you came down on and turn so that they are on your right. There will be a chest slightly to the right of a large hole in the hull which contains the folio, a special edition of the naughty tome The Lusty Argonian Maid. Return to Raven Rock and locate Cindiri Arano. When you hand her the missing folio she will be ecstatic: ""You have no idea what this means to me... to my family. Reclamations bless you! Well, you've certainly proven your worth around here to me. Please, accept this gift as a token of my appreciation!"" She will then hand you the reward, a leveled and enchanted ring, necklace, or circlet."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:First_Lessons","Approach the bridge to College of Winterhold. Speak to Faralda. Prove your ability or persuade her, provided you have a high enough Speech skill. Cross the bridge and enter the courtyard. (Optional) Speak to Mirabelle Ervine. Enter the Hall of the Elements. Listen to Tolfdir's lecture and participate.","Entrance Exam[edit] Before heading to Winterhold to start this quest, you may want to check whether you have enough magicka to complete the quest's first challenge—you may need as much as 135 magicka. With the novice hood found in Helgen Keep during Unbound, even new level-one characters will have 130 magicka. If you do not have other Fortify Magicka apparel or potions, one option available to everyone is to visit the Temple of the Divines in Solitude and activate the shrine of Julianos to obtain 25 more magicka from the Blessing of Julianos. If you have the Dragonborn add-on installed, you may choose the power Secret of Arcana from the black book Filament and Filigree and all your spells will cost no magicka for 30 seconds. Once in Winterhold, follow the main road west through town, and approach the prominent bridge connecting the town to the College of Winterhold. Standing at the approach of the bridge is Faralda. She will ask you about your intentions and what you expect to find on entering the college. Several options would be available for you. Option  Dialogue   I want to use the power of ice and fire to destroy any who oppose me. I see. That power certainly exists, I assure you. Wield it faithfully, and few can withstand you.   I desire to bend the will of those around me. Yes, the school of Illusion can be quite influential. Kings have risen to power because of it, and empires have been razed with it.   I want to unravel the mysteries of Aetherius. Ah, the immortal plane. It is said to be the source of all magic. This is a noble goal, indeed.   I seek the knowledge of the Elder Scrolls.† Do you? It is true there are some here who have spent years studying the accumulated knowledge of the scrolls. But what you seek does not come easily, and can destroy those without a strong will.   I just wanted to see what it looks like inside. Ha! Humor is often in short supply here. But I sense that perhaps you're after more than just that. †Only available during the quests Elder Knowledge and Scroll ScoutingDG or if you have completed those quests without speaking to Faralda previously. Regardless of the dialogue options you choose, she will ultimately decide that you need a lesson and will say that you must take a small test to show that you have some degree of skill with magic. If you agree, she will randomly select one spell from any one of the five schools of magic for you to cast. This may be: Casting a Firebolt at the eye-shaped seal next to her. Conjuring a Flame Atronach on the seal. Casting Fear at the seal. Casting Healing Hands on her. Casting Magelight at the seal. If you do not have the spell she asks of you, she will offer to teach it to you for 30 gold. This is an easy and cheap way to learn any one of the above spells. You must cast the spell at the circular impression in the floor behind her. Casting the spell in any other location will not progress the quest. However, if she asks you to conjure a Flame Atronach, and you already have a Flame Thrall summoned, simply exiting the conversation and speaking to her again will successfully progress the dialogue. Alternatively, you can attempt to persuade her and avoid this test. In order to persuade her, you will need a Speech skill of 100 (70 with the Persuasion perk) or the Amulet of Articulation.  If you are on the quest Elder Knowledge you can also mention that you are Dragonborn. She will then ask to see a shout.  Either of these will get you in without needing to cast a spell. Regardless of which path you take, Faralda will allow you across the bridge and direct you to Mirabelle Ervine. College Orientation Day[edit] After you speak to Mirabelle Ervine, she will want to give you a tour of the facilities. Before that, however, she will give you three items to wear (although wearing them is not mandatory for membership): a Novice Hood (+30 to Magicka), a Novice Robes of Destruction (-12% to Destruction Spell Magicka Cost, Magicka regenerates 50% faster) and College Boots (unenchanted). As you follow her around the college, she will point and explain the few areas and what their purpose is. She will lead you to your new quarters, which is an Apprentice room in the Hall of Attainment, a circular chamber with five rooms total. One room is assigned to each of the apprentices, and one to Tolfdir. Your room is the first on the right, and includes a bed, several furniture containers, and some starting items such as a few soul gems. The furniture containers (wardrobes, end tables, and drawer) are safe for storage, but the food barrels respawn and are unsafe. Join the Lecture[edit] ""Welcome, welcome! We were just beginning. Please, stay and listen."" Upon completing the tour, Mirabelle will ask you to join Tolfdir's lecture in the lecture hall. Tolfdir will begin the lesson, addressing you and three of your peers. The other students will badger the professor to teach them a practical application of magic instead of lecturing about the importance of mitigating the damages. Eventually, Tolfdir will ask you what you think. Whatever your response, Tolfdir will ask you to perform a Ward spell. If you do not have this spell, he will give it to you freely. You will be asked to cast the spell and fend off his attack with it. After you successfully defend yourself from one of his fire balls, the quest is finished, and Tolfdir will suggest a school field trip and you are off on the next quest. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked during this quest, when Faralda allows you across the bridge: Gatekeeper (10 points/Bronze)"

Return to Grosta for your reward.","The Angry Wife[edit] Heartwood Mill, a remote lumber mill located where Lake Honrich turns into Treva River, seems less busy than other mills with only Grosta working the mill and her son Gralnach fooling around on and off the road. If you talk to Gralnach, he will explain his father disappeared without a trace and left him and his mother alone with a mill to run. Talking to Grosta will reveal her suspicion that Leifnarr ran off with another woman and that she can't run the mill by herself. She then explains how Leifnarr left to trade wood and grain with some merchants near the Morrowind border, specifically a place called Broken Helm Hollow, and will mark the place on your map. Merchants from Morrowind[edit] A murdered husband When you arrive at Broken Helm Hollow, it quickly becomes evident that Leifnarr was set up, as two leveled bandits will guard the cave entrance.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:For_the_Good_of_Morthal","Speak to Gorm when he's apart from the Jarl. Deliver Gorm's letter to Captain Aldis in Solitude.","Unfit to Lead[edit] Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone governs Hjaalmarch from her seat in Morthal. She is gifted with visions that seem to occupy most of her attention; she is less concerned with governing a people than she is with attending to her visions and passing on the wisdom she gleans. Her administration is under scrutiny as a result, as you will find out when visiting Morthal. If you speak to Gorm, Idgrod's housecarl, inside of Highmoon Hall he will be very solicitous of Ravencrone and her visions. However, if approached while away from the jarl he will reveal that his concerns are not just about her safety, but rather the condition her gift has left her in. He believes that she may no longer be able to adequately act as jarl of Hjaalmarch. Speak with Gorm while he is dining at Moorside Inn at 6:00 p.m., or while he is walking to and from Highmoon Hall: ""My mind weighs heavy enough. Leave me to my food."" Is there something bothering you, Gorm? ""She's so lost in her visions, and it's only getting worse. I've looked after her safety for so long... If she can't tell what's real and what's not, how will she continue to lead Hjaalmarch?"" Is there anything I can do? ""Yes, I suppose there is. There is a letter, one I have had for some time now.

""Thank you. Please, do not open it. It is... private."" He will give you a letter to deliver to an Imperial Legion officer, Captain Aldis. Aldis can be found in Solitude at Castle Dour. Reading Gorm's Letter reveals that there is seemingly a plan in the works to remove Idgrod from power. Aldis, however, seems far less sanguine at the prospect of removing a sitting Empire-loyal jarl during wartime; but, he will take the information under advisement: I have a letter for you. ""For me? From whom?"" It's from Gorm, in Morthal. ""Well now, that is something. Hand it over, please."" He will then read the letter, and continue, saying: ""Oh, no. I hadn't heard from Gorm for a while, so I'd hoped he'd given up on his little scheme. The last time we'd discussed this issue was before this damnable war broke out. Things were different then.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Forbidden_Legend","Learn of the Gauldur legend. Read Daynas Valen's journal and notes in Folgunthur to learn the truth in the legend. Find the three parts of the amulet in Saarthal, Geirmund's Hall, and Folgunthur. Reforge the amulet in Reachwater Rock.","The Legend of Gauldur[edit] ""The history of Skyrim is vast, predating even the most ancient records of man and mer. Much has been lost, fallen to the ravages of war or the turning of the ages. But nothing is ever truly forgotten. Where no records exist, legends and folk tales offer us a key to the past, a way to piece together truths half-remembered in the minds of men."" The easiest way to uncover one of the best-kept secrets in Skyrim is to locate and read the book Lost Legends for a bit of guesswork on the tragic events that took place back in the First Era. Due to the secrecy surrounding the Gauldur legend, the author will rely mostly on speculation to provide two possible takes on Gauldur's demise. Gauldur, once an incredibly powerful wizard in the courts of King Harald, was assassinated by either the king himself, or by his three sons, Jyrik, Mikrul, and Sigdis Gauldurson. Both theories suggest jealousy as the main motive. The legend then tells about how the three sons had to flee into the night, immediately chased by King Harald's warriors, led by battlemage Lord Geirmund. The books mention that one of the brothers disappeared into Folgunthur and the others were run into the ground soon thereafter. A Key to the Past[edit] There are multiple ways of initiating the quest. Reading Lost Legends is the way to go if you want to initiate the quest properly and learn every detail about Gauldur and his sons (see book locations here). However, a few other items scattered around Skyrim will start the quest as well. Defeat Sigdis in Geirmund's Hall or Jyrik in Saarthal and read the writ of sealing. This will add a map marker to the nearest copy of the book. Defeat Mikrul in Folgunthur and read his writ of sealing, then follow the map marker to Daynas Valen's Notes. Read the Ancient Edict inside Reachwater Rock, then follow the map marker to the book. Read Daynas Valen's Notes, found on his corpse inside Folgunthur, then proceed as instructed. Another quest-related item, Daynas Valen's Journal, can be found and read in the camp outside Folgunthur but can break the quest if read at the wrong time (see bugs section for more information) and should only be read when the quest marker points to it. Folgunthur[edit] After reading Lost Legends, the quest will start right away. Your first objective is to investigate the Gauldur legend. As mentioned in the book, the only known location is the Nord ruin of Folgunthur, south of Solitude. When you arrive you will notice an abandoned camp set up right outside the ruin entrance. Investigate the tents to find an interesting journal scribbled down by Daynas Valen, a Dunmer obsessed with the legend, who searched all over Cyrodiil for clues. The search eventually brought him to Skyrim and Folgunthur; follow your map marker into the ruin. Daynas Valen Immediately upon entering it is evident that someone was there before. An adventurer obviously overlooked the pressure plate and the corresponding spear trap. More supporting evidence can be found in the first room where a Dragon Claw puzzle and surrounding pillars have been solved already, except for a hidden door that you do not have the claw for yet, so remember to bring it by here after you have acquired it. Moving on past the remains of yet another adventurer, you will encounter a draugr and a huge room which immediately seals behind you. Several draugr enemies will break out of their coffins and attack. Using the oil on the floor will be to your advantage. Locate the spiral staircase to the north and beware of the disappearing grate. Should you fall into the water, just locate the handles and pull yourself back out. Head upstairs and locate the dead body of Daynas Valen leaning against another dragon claw trigger. Examine his body for the ivory dragon claw and his essential notes; make sure to read them as instructed. This will add three new map markers and three new objectives which will reveal the truth about Gauldur and his three sons. After reading the notes, insert the ivory dragon claw in the keyhole and cross the bridge. Proceed through the catacombs and fight the draugr enemies until four gates block the path. Investigate the wall for four corresponding levers. Each lever activates a specific set of doors. The first lever on the right activates doors 1, 3, and 4; the second lever on the right activates doors 1 and 4; the first lever on the left activates doors 2 and 3; the second lever on the left activates door 3. While facing the gates, pull the first lever on the left and the second lever on the right to open all four gates. Head down the stony steps and watch out for the falling boulders in the next room. Four draugr and another puzzle wait in the next room, along with three symbols in the neighboring room. The first room contains an iron chain and two handles next to the thrones. The chain will only release a few darts at the moment, so check out the symbols in the neighboring room. Facing north, clockwise, the symbols are: Snake—Whale—Eagle. Pull any of the handles in the previous room, which will reveal a new room and release a high level draugr. The movable pillars will have to reflect the ones you just saw, so face north and turn them so they match clockwise. Return to the first room and pull the chain, which will now remove the grate leading downstairs. The damp underground area hosts a few frostbite spiders. As you surface from the water, six draugr enemies will burst out of their coffins and attack. The puzzle door will require you to examine the claw found on Daynas Valen's body; the solution, from the outermost ring inward, is Hawk—Hawk—Dragon. Turn the rings and insert the claw in the keyhole and watch the wall disappear. Finally, make your way to Folgunthur Crypt and prepare yourself for battle. Mikrul Gauldurson[edit] Mikrul Gauldurson The final resting place for Mikrul Gauldurson is a large chamber. When you approach, Mikrul himself smashes open his coffin. Soon he is flanked by four draugr thrall, and the battle with Mikrul begins. Mikrul himself is a powerful draugr and will use the leveled Gauldur Blackblade, a one-handed sword with an Absorb Health enchantment. Begin the fight and focus on Mikrul as the other draugr will only do minor damage. When he is disposed of, search his body for the writ of sealing, his leveled blade, and, most importantly, the Gauldur Amulet Fragment. This fragment is one of three pieces of Gauldur's powerful amulet, stolen by the brothers after the murder. Although referred to as a fragment, it is a fully functional amulet that increases your health 30 points. Lastly, use the claw on the southern wall for access to a boss-leveled chest and a word wall, which has one of the words for the Frost Breath shout. To make it out of the dungeon, pull the chain at the right of the closed metal gate and head upstairs. Saarthal[edit] As part of your initiation into the College of Winterhold, you will have to participate in an expedition to one of the earliest Nord settlements in Skyrim. This settlement happens to be none other than Saarthal. The related quest, Under Saarthal, is the only way to access the ruin, so join college professor Tolfdir on what is meant as an educational journey for college newcomers. The trek through the ruin will reveal more than one secret, along with the sealed resting place of Jyrik Gauldurson, your next target for the Forbidden Legend quest. However, make Under Saarthal your active quest for now and follow the walkthrough.[verification needed — see talk page] Jyrik Gauldurson[edit] Jyrik Gauldurson After a long trek through the dungeon with Tolfdir, the final chamber will reveal a sight to behold. A huge, glowing orb rotates in the center of the room, seemingly shielded by magic, and Tolfdir will be understandably puzzled. When you approach what turns out to be the Eye of Magnus (as revealed during the College of Winterhold quest line), Jyrik Gauldurson will rise from his throne near the table. Tolfdir will attack him with all he's got, but will soon realize he is invulnerable due to the Eye of Magnus. You will have to keep Jyrik occupied while Tolfdir drains the magic from the eye, which will make Jyrik vulnerable after a short period of time. He uses an ancient Nord war axe but should not give you any trouble once Tolfdir has performed his magic tricks. When he is disposed of, claim his Amulet Fragment, which increases magicka by 30 points and the writ of sealing. Remember to claim the unique Staff of Jyrik Gauldurson from the table, then speak to Tolfdir. Tolfdir will ask you to return to the College of Winterhold. Make Forbidden Legends your active quest again and leave him through the western door where you will find a boss leveled chest and a word wall with a word for the Ice Form shout.  Geirmund's Hall[edit] According to the research of Daynas Valen, Sigdis Gauldurson was the brother to finally slay Lord Geirmund after the defeat of his other brothers. Sigdis himself fell in the lengthy battle and Geirmund's Hall was to be his final resting place, forever sealed and protected by the earthly remains of Geirmund. Geirmund's Hall is found on an island straight east of Ivarstead, conveniently surrounded by Lake Geir. Compared to the other two tombs, Geirmund's Hall is rather small, but it soon becomes apparent exactly why Geirmund fell to Sigdis. The late Lord Geirmund Upon entering, fight a few resident skeevers and examine yet another dead adventurer. Locate the deep pit in the center of the chamber and make sure you have stocked up on supplies, then take the long fall into the depths, where you will land in an underground lake. Examine the water for a tunnel with some treasure and a Draught of Waterbreathing potion, then head up the wooden bridge and open the door. Two frostbite spiders will protect their nest and a locked door hiding some minor loot. Beware of the plate triggering a dart trap and proceed to the first a flooded puzzle chamber. Dispose of the residing draugr enemies and, if so desired, carefully claim the soul gem from the weight sensitive plate on the table, which will trigger a deadly battering ram when removed. Return to the stairs near the entrance to the chamber and take a look at the symbols on the walls. Your task is to rotate the pillars on the walls to match these symbols in the same order and on the same walls. The sequence is Eagle—Whale—Snake—Whale. Stand at the first encountered pillar, then moving around the room clockwise, rotate the pillars accordingly. Pull the lever, head up the stairs, and proceed to the next room, a narrow chamber in two levels. Take the wooden bridge to the upper level and behold the sight of Archmage Geirmund, the mighty slayer of the three brothers, now reduced to a draugr-like skeleton on a pedestal. Read his epitaph and claim the key from his fingers. Use it to unlock the nearby door, then fight another draugr and a frostbite spider protecting an arcane enchanter. The pathway east leads to a collapsed tunnel with a levelled Potion of Invisibility sitting on a broken table. Take the western stairs and follow the tunnel as it bends until you reach a lever and a raised wooden bridge. Stay away from the obvious lever as it will only release a set of spikes, and investigate the wall to the west of (directly behind) the obvious lever for hidden lever that will lower the bridge. From the bridge, it is optional to jump down on a secret ledge to the southwest for a locked chest protected by a spellcaster trap. Get back on track and lower the second bridge for still more draugr enemies and a hall protected by swinging blades. Make your way through and turn them off using the chain on the wall. Proceed forward until you enter a flooded room with several platforms and a mysterious mist coming from the water. This is the final resting place for Sigdis Gauldurson. Sigdis Gauldurson[edit] Sigdis Gauldurson Before heading up the wooden bridge, take a look around the chamber. All the platforms can easily be reached from below and if you are a melee fighter, you will need this knowledge later. Head up the bridge and approach the coffin, which will cause Sigdis to break out and immediately teleport to any one of the three pedestals around the room. He will then conjure two illusions of himself, placed on the platforms. If you kill the illusions, Sigdis will simply teleport and create two new ones, so there's not much point in going after the illusions at all. You must find the real Sigdis and defeat him. How to quickly distinguish between the real Sigdis and his Illusions The real Sigdis does not glow blue like the illusions do. The illusions have glowing purple runes on them, which the true Sigdis lacks. The real Sigdis' health bar goes down when he is hit; the illusions generally die in one hit. The real Sigdis has a helm with horns curled down, like an ancient Nord or Ahzidal's helmet; the illusions have helms with the horns straight and pointed upward. If you approach Sigdis, he will generally try to deal one more hit of damage before teleporting and summoning new illusions. This rapid room-crossing can be tricky to overcome for melee-dependent classes. Ranged classes can quickly climb onto either of the central platforms and snipe away. Sigdis will neither teleport to nor create illusions on the platform you are standing on, however he can knock you off the platform with his Unrelenting Force shout and do heavy damage with his bow as you struggle to your feet. Use your combat method of choice and defeat the hard boss. Keep an eye on your health at all times and be careful he doesn't disarm you. When he is slain, claim his unique Gauldur Blackbow, the writ of sealing, and the Gauldur Amulet Fragment (+30 points to stamina) from his corpse. Doing this will reveal a tunnel behind his coffin leading to his treasure room, which includes the boss-leveled chest, the Two-handed skill book Words and Philosophy, and some scattered potions and soul gems. Find the nearby tunnel and follow it to a lever that will lower a rock wall and bring you right back to the pit you jumped into near the entrance. Reachwater Rock[edit] After conquering Saarthal, Folgunthur, and Geirmund's Hall and defeating the undead reincarnations of Jyrik, Mikrul, and Sigdis, the time has finally come to reforge the three Gauldur Amulet Fragments and put the legend to rest. You are pointed towards Reachwater Rock, a cave hidden underneath one of the waterfalls running into Karth River, southeast of Markarth. Enter the cave and head downstream. There is an adept-locked chest in the water, plus a skeleton not far away (at the bottom of the pond) with some armor. Be careful if you decide to swim for the chest, as the waterfall applies a great amount of force to the water above you forcing you to the bottom of the pool, hindering your escape. Without a spell or potion of Water breathing you will likely drown attempting to return to the surface. Climb back out of the water and up to the central plateau with a deceased adventurer and a podium with the emerald dragon claw, along with the unsettling ancient edict. Head to the door and examine your new dragon claw for the combination (Bear—Whale—Snake) and rotate the rings to match. Insert the claw in the keyhole and the door will open, along with three similar doors further ahead. Another puzzle door will block your path, and this time you will need the ivory dragon claw you claimed back in Folgunthur. Rotate the rings to match the Hawk—Hawk—Dragon symbols on the claw and follow the corridor a long way down toward a huge chamber with a set of stairs in the center. Notice the many coffins surrounding the area and make your way to the three Amulet Pedestals. Place a fragment on top of each pedestal and listen to the sound of the gate closing behind you. Gauldur[edit] The ghosts of all three murderous brothers will now appear over the pedestals and you will have to fight them all, one by one. First up is Mikrul, who appears near the recently closed gate along with an army of draugr thrall. Pick the chaotic fight and watch the ghost of Mikrul disappear and kneel next to his brothers when you slay him. Next up is Sigdis, the hardest of the three, who will repeat his old trick, spawning three fake clones this time around instead of two. As before, the real Sigdis has a different helmet with curved horns, making him easy to identify. Jyrik is the last of the three, and he will teleport himself around at random times and summon daedric enemies to help him out. Take him down and watch the last of the three ghosts fall to the ground. As the three of them try to get back on their feet, Gauldur himself will appear and blow them all away with a gigantic explosion. He will then forge the three amulet pieces into one, finally ending the curse and providing your reward. The complete Gauldur Amulet increases your health, magicka, and stamina by 30 points. Before you leave, take a look at the skeleton remains of Gauldur, the powerful wizard murdered by his own sons thousands of years ago. Search the bones for a considerable amount of gold, then leave. On your way out, a hidden wall will have lowered, revealing even more rewards for your tireless quest for the truth: a boss leveled treasure chest. Gauldur's coffin breaks open.    Forging the Amulet Fragments    The Gauldur Amulet    Peace at last  ""And once it was done, King Harald ordered every record of their murders destroyed, and Gauldur's name and deeds were struck from the rolls of history. Even today, few sources remain, and no bard will tell the tale. But perhaps the truth yet remains in some ancient ruin, waiting to be unearthed. For nothing is ever truly forgotten.""

Return to the gauntlet and place the rings in their correct places. Decide whether to kill or help release Velehk Sain. Claim your treasure (if you spared Velehk Sain).","The Midden Dark[edit] While exploring The Midden Dark beneath the College of Winterhold, you will discover a circular room littered with blood and skeletons. In the center of the room sits a small statue in the form of a gauntlet. On the table nearby there will be a key and an incident report which describes a failed summoning ritual and four rings. Ornamental Rings[edit] Once all rings are placed on the gauntlet... Following the clues in the report, the player can find the needed rings in a master-locked chest located in the Arcanaeum. The lock can be picked, or simply opened with the key, in order to obtain the four ornamental rings: Pithi's Ring, Treoy's Ring, Balwen's Ring, and Katarina's Ring. Note that the rings are owned, and removing them from the chest is considered stealing and any mages in the library (including Urag gro-Shub) will attack if they see you take the contents of the chest. To reduce your risk of detection, you can either wait until Urag retires to his room at night, or enter the library immediately after finishing ""The Eye of Magnus"", as he won't be there right away. If you are the Arch-Mage and steal the rings, and get caught, they may not necessarily attack you, but the rings will be removed from you and you may not ever be able to get them back. Once you have obtained the rings, return to the gauntlet in the Midden Dark. Place the rings on the gauntlet by activating each finger as follows: Index Finger:  Katarina's Ring Middle Finger: Treoy's Ring Ring Finger:  Balwen's Ring Little Finger: Pithi's Ring.  The Summoning[edit] ... Velehk Sain will be summoned. Velehk Sain's treasure Once all four rings are placed on the appropriate fingers, the fingers will curl into a fist, and a Dremora pirate named Velehk Sain will be summoned. He will bargain with you for his release, offering treasure from his pirating days in exchange. You can choose out of two options: Release: If you release him, he will vanish and you will receive Velehk Sain's Treasure Map. The map leads to a hidden stash of treasure (leveled general treasure), located west-northwest of Winterhold, and north of Saarthal, on a peninsula with a statue of Talos. Note that there are several statues of Talos in the surrounding area; the one you need is the one where the statue is at the very apex of the small island. (map). The treasure is magically hidden and will only reveal itself if Velehk is released. The treasure is conjured by your proximity, so you will not see it from a distance.

Defeat the Sky Orchestrator and claim Turn of the Seasons to gain new passive perks.","A Lost Ruin[edit] Find the lost Dwemer ruins of Vardnknd This quest will be added to your journal upon installing the Forgotten Seasons Creation. You will be directed to Runoff Caverns, an undiscovered cave far south of Rorikstead which will already be marked on your map. The cave has an unassuming entrance located just west of Lost Valley Redoubt; you will know you have arrived once you see the torso of a broken Dwarven Horse. Activating this strange relic will begin a separate quest called The Dwarven Horse to reassemble the construct, which can be done in tandem with this quest. Head inside the dungeon and you will quickly notice that these natural caverns actually contain a large Dwarven ruin. You will soon come to a massive central chamber where a group of deceased mercenaries had set up camp. A note in one of the tents will provide some context for this failed expedition; the dead mercs were hired by a mage who headed deeper into the ruins, leaving them to guard the entrance. Clearly they were overwhelmed by the Dwarven spiders patrolling the cavern, and the drawbridge spanning the chasm has unfortunately been raised, blocking your progress. Your only option is to descend to the floor of the cavern, fighting your way through hostile automatons until you come to a side passage. This path will eventually lead you up and around to the other side of the cavern, where you will begin to encounter hostile mercenaries who are still very much alive. Before you continue on deeper into the ruins, it is advisable to drop the lever lowering the drawbridge, allowing for easy access back to the entrance camp without having to trudge back through the side passages each time. With this done, continue on until you come to the entrance of Vardnknd. You will likely hear this entrance before you see it, as it is surrounded by stormclouds and lightning strikes. The lightning will hit you if you tarry, so move swiftly onward. A Mage on a Mission[edit] Once you've entered the ruins proper, you will find yourself in Vardnknd Gallery, a central hub area for the dungeon. You will be greeted by a scene of chaos, as lightning strikes and hostile mercenaries fill the entire chamber. You will play witness to the death of the mage Elberon by one such lightning strike. He is the leader of this expedition, and as his journal reveals he has entered the ruins in an attempt to shut down the Weather Witch contained within. These rare devices have the ability to control the weather, and this particular one threatens to throw the entirety of Skyrim into chaos due to malfunction. Deal with the hostile mercenaries, then locate and read his journal to progress the quest. You will also be directed to loot Elberon's body as part of another separate quest called The Dwarven Crown, which again can be done concurrently with this one. The journal also advises you to read Elberon's account of his previous expedition to the ruins, titled Forgotten Seasons, v1. A copy can be found on his desk and provides a guide on how to navigate the rest of the dungeon, and you will need to read same to progress the quest. In short, you will need to recover three Vardnknd Conduit Gems from separate sections of the ruins in order to turn off the Weather Witch and face the final boss. These can be recovered in any order you like, as the entrance to all four areas are located in Vardnknd Gallery. Autumn Harvest[edit] The Autumn's Bells section of the dungeon consists of what looks to be an underground farm, tended by dangerous Dwarven automatons. Travel down the entrance hallway (which will eventually open out into the agricultural fields) until you find a dead mercenary carrying a Note on Autumn explaining how to reach the gem in this section. The objective here is to harvest strange magical wheat that grows in the fields all across the chamber, and place one of each type in six corresponding depository containers to unlock the treasure room containing the gem. You only need to harvest at least one sample of each of the six types of wheat (Blue Luminous, Glowing Red, Off-Color, Orange-Encrusted, Sickly Green, and White Molded), and you can harvest an infinite amount of weightless wheat from a single plant. Once you have deposited wheat in all the containers, the treasure room will open and you will be free to disable this section's conduit gem. If you are doing the other two quests, Autumn's Bells also contains all the necessary parts to repair the Dwarven horse, as well as one of the masks needed for the Crown quest. A helpful drone Spriggan Hunting[edit] The Spring's Symphony section of the dungeon is filled with spriggans and animals, always a dangerous combination due to spriggans' ability to turn normally passive animals hostile. This part of the ruins is a basic dungeon crawl, although impassable vines will be blocking your way forward. You will again need to locate the body of a dead mercenary to read the Note on Spring, which explains that you need to kill the Blooming Spriggans specifically in order to get past the vines. Certain corridors are also filled with a green miasma which causes poison damage. You will eventually be confronted by a boss-level Blooming Spriggan Matron carrying the Vardnknd Spring Key, needed later. You then jump down a drop to the Conduit Control Gem and activate it. There is a shortcut to return to the entrance from there. Other treasures of note include another mask for the Crown quest and a tiny Dwarven Drone Fly. The Mask of Spring is at the end of the hallway through the door near the beginning of the Spring's Symphony section. It requires the Matron's key, which means you'll have to reenter this section after completing it. The Dwarven Drone Fly is near the end of the dungeon beside a chest and a chair, shortly before the drop to disable the conduit. The fly can be picked up and used as a companion. It will only follow you for short intervals at a time, but while active it will grant you poison resistance and increased stamina, which can be useful for navigating the sections of this zone containing toxic green gas. Shall I compare thee?[edit] The Summer's Chords section of the dungeon is entirely flooded with lava, requiring you to walk along piping and narrow bridges so as not to fall to your doom. Just inside the entrance, a mercenary who carries the Note on Summer lies dead next to a Spider Control Rod and a lever. Pulling the lever will spawn a non-hostile, friendly Repair Spider.  As explained by the note, in order to disable the conduit here, you need to direct the repair spider to several ""service waypoints"" throughout the section. These are small metal pads which glow yellow when activated by the spider. In order to move the spider, you will need to take and equip the nearby Spider Control Rod, which functions identically to a similar rod found in Calcelmo's Laboratory: aim it at where you want the spider to go. Unfortunately, your way is impeded by several flame atronachs who can attack the spider, as well as traps which can also kill the spider if you aren't careful about its positioning. If the spider dies for any reason, go back to the entrance and use the switch to spawn another one. Once all the waypoints are activated, the conduit shuts down; there is no conduit gem to obtain here, nor any hidden loot. Note: In the first hallway to the right after obtaining the spider there is a locked chest, in the hallway to the left with a small downward ramp, repair spider may get ""stuck""; in order to move on, kill the repair spider and return to get a new one. There is also a chest behind the last waypoint. Diving Lessons[edit] The Winter's Chimes section initially appears to be a snowy exterior area. You will walk in to a scene of gore as the bodies of dead mercenaries fall from above, having been slaughtered by the icy inhabitants of this area. The first of these mercenaries lies dead at the threshold between the entryway and the first of many vertical chambers in this section, which is climbed with a spiraling ramp; the mercenary carries the Note on Winter, and two waterbreathing potions lie beside him. Make your way up the ramp and face off against the Frosted Dwarven Spiders, which use frost attacks rather than the usual lightning. As you ascend, you will soon realize that this section is actually one large chamber caught in an eternal artificial blizzard. The remainder of this section continues to be just as vertical as the starting area, requiring you to leap into half-frozen pools of water before ascending again. In addition to the spiders, beware Frost Atronachs and Ice Wraiths as you navigate the level. Once you reach the summit, you can grab the conduit gem and leave. The real challenge from this level is designed around the Cold mechanic in the Survival Mode Creation, which is affected by icy water and exposure to the elements. Followers cannot accompany you here, forcing you to deal with any enemies using your own skills or conjured helpers. This section also contains a mask for the Crown quest, well-hidden and guarded by a powerful Frosted Dwarven Centurion. Shut down the Weather Witch Face the Sky Orchestrator[edit] Once you have deactivated all four conduits, you will return to the Vardnknd Gallery hub area only to find it once again occupied by hostile mercenaries. Beware, as they spawn alongside Elberon's Apprentice, a very angry mage seeking to avenge his master's death. Once you've dealt with the competition, you will have to approach the west side of the Gallery, towards a door located on a ledge above. As you get nearer, stairs will rise to give you access to the door above (see bugs). This leads to Vardnknd Skykiller Gallery, a chamber containing the final boss: the Sky Orchestrator, a giant dwarven spider. The Sky Orchestrator can be a challenging fight and possesses several stages. Initially the Orchestrator will enter frost mode and deal AoE frost damage. This will then switch to fire mode, at which point the Orchestrator will be doing fire damage and summoning Enraged Spriggans. Finally, it will enter lightning mode and deal significant shock damage until it is destroyed. Loot its remains for the Ward of the Seasons, a unique Dwarven cuirass. With the final boss destroyed, you will be rewarded at long last with Turn of the Seasons, a book which you can consume to obtain a new Power. This constant-effect ability grants the following buffs, depending on the weather: Fortify Barter, 10pts when it rains Regenerate Stamina, 5% if you are wearing a full Light Armor set in clear or sunny weather 10% more critical damage with Bows when overcast Armor, 10pts if you are wearing a full Heavy Armor set when it is snowing Using the lift in Skykiller Gallery will bring you right back to the entrance of Runoff Caverns, allowing for a swift exit. Congratulations!"

(Optional) Talk with Eltrys in the Shrine of Talos to get your reward. Find evidence about Thonar. Find out who ""N"" is. Find evidence about Nepos. Return to the shrine.","The Attack[edit] Glory to the Forsworn! While walking through the open market in Markarth, a woman named Margret is viciously attacked while buying jewelry. Her attacker, a Breton witchblade named Weylin, will shout ""The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!"" as he attempts to escape. If you do not step in, the guards will kill Weylin, who defiantly exclaims, ""I die for my people."" In the ensuing confusion, the guards are curt as they try to quell the small crowd that has gathered. If you ask about the crime and the Forsworn, they tell you that the Forsworn are nothing but a bunch of madmen, and to mind your own business. If you search Margret's body, take the key to her room for use later in the quest, although you will be able to acquire it later on from the Silver-Blood Inn innkeeper. It is possible to save Margret from Weylin if you're fast enough. If you do save her, she rewards you with the pendant she just purchased. (Preventing the murder will affect the course of the quest; see notes below.)  The Meeting[edit] Shortly after the scene in the marketplace, a Breton citizen named Eltrys will approach you and ask if you saw what happened. You can chat with him for a bit about the assault, but then he will suddenly say, ""Oh, I think you dropped this. Some kind of note. Looks important."" If you question him about the note, he feigns innocence. The note tells you to meet him at the Shrine of Talos. You can ask him how to find the shrine, and while he is still elusive, he will say: ""Huh. Not sure. I don't worship Talos, myself. I think I heard someone mention it was underneath the Temple of Dibella, in the big crag in the center of the city."" Travel to the shrine underneath the Temple of Dibella. To get there, climb the stairs at the north corner of the marketplace, follow the bridge to the left, then take the path to the left and you should see the door. Descend into the temple and speak to Eltrys, who has been looking for answers about the Forsworn attacks that have been happening in the city, ever since his father was killed by the Forsworn and that he has been trying his whole life to find out why, and why the guards do nothing about it. He pleads for your help; find out why Weylin attacked Margret and who is behind all of this. He will pay you for any information you can bring. Margret[edit] To find information on Margret, go to the Silver-Blood Inn and ask Kleppr or Frabbi about her. She apparently rented the nicest room in the inn, which is down the hall to the left of the entrance. If you did not obtain the key to Margret's room from her corpse earlier, you can receive it through dialogue with Kleppr, steal it from behind the bar (or even just simply take it freely), or just pick the lock to her door. Searching the end table in her room will yield Margret's journal. After reading her journal, you learn that she probably wasn't just a casual jewelry shopper, and that she has been gathering information about Thonar Silver-Blood. If Margret is alive, she will be sitting by the fire at the inn or standing out in the marketplace. You can persuade her to divulge her real purpose in Markarth. Apparently, Margret is an Imperial spy working with General Tullius to investigate the Treasury House and the Silver-Blood family. She was hoping to procure the deed to Cidhna Mine for the Imperials. She is also sure that Thonar Silver-Blood arranged for her murder. After leaving the inn with your information about Margret, a Markarth City guard will try to warn you off your investigations. You can report back to Eltrys with your information about Margret for a leveled gold reward, or continue researching Weylin and Thonar before going back to Eltrys. Weylin[edit] In your investigations thus far, you have learned that Weylin worked as a smelter at Cidhna Mine and lived in the Warrens—a public house for the city's destitute. You can follow the smelter lead to the Smelter Overseer's House to speak with Mulush gro-Shugurz. However, he is reluctant to talk to you, giving you a Speech challenge, which actually results in very little information. You will find out that you need to go to the Warrens and speak with Garvey. A more direct route will be to speak with Garvey, a resident of the Warrens and the keeper of the keys. Ask him about Weylin and tell him you need the key to Weylin's room. He will only give you the key if you pass a Speech challenge to persuade, intimidate, or bribe him. Option  Dialogue  Reaction   It's important. Trust me. (Persuade) Passed: Trust is hard to come by here, but all right.Failed: No. It's not. Trust me. Passed: Continue investigationFailed: Nothing   How about now? (Bribe) Passed: Welcome to the Warrens.Failed: No, I don't think so. Passed: Continue investigationFailed: Nothing   I wasn't asking. (Intimidate) Passed: Now don't get all upset. Here. Take it.Failed: And I wasn't stuttering. No key. Passed: Continue investigationFailed: Nothing   Never mind, then. Right. Nothing If you do not receive the key, you can pick the lock on the door or pickpocket the key from Garvey. Weylin's room is to the rear of the Warrens, on the right-hand side. Enter it and look in the chest for a note addressed to Weylin. Read the note to learn that Weylin truly was not acting alone, and that some anonymous puppet-master named only ""N"" was directing Weylin's actions. You will now gain the objective ""Find out who N is"". When you exit the Warrens, a Breton named Dryston will approach you, threatening: ""You've been digging around where you don't belong. It's time you learned a lesson."" You have some dialogue options, but it will come down to Dryston taking a swing at you and a brawl ensuing. If you attack Dryston with anything but your fists (i.e., weapons or magic), you will receive a bounty and any guards that witness the fight will attack you. Once you defeat Dryston, he will tell you, ""I was sent by Nepos the Nose. The old man hands out the orders. He told me to make sure you didn't get in the way. That's all I know, I swear!"" This is all Dryston knows, and any attempts at further questions will just be answered with, ""Nepos is in charge. That's all I know."" Dryston also carries a note confirming it was Nepos that directed him to ""rough you up"". You are now directed to find out about Nepos the Nose. You can report back to Eltrys with what you have discovered about Nepos for a leveled gold reward. Eltrys will be quite surprised that Nepos may be involved, but concedes that he may be getting orders from elsewhere. From here, continue on with your investigation into Thonar. Thonar[edit] For the Forsworn! Following Eltrys' suspicions that Thonar and the Treasury House are involved in this conspiracy should be your next stop. When you enter the venerable financial institution, Rhiada will be at the front desk. You can ask to see Thonar, which prompts a Speech challenge, or you can just pick the lock on the door to the left of the front desk, bypassing Rhiada altogether. When you enter Thonar's room he doesn't seem alarmed to see you and you may speak to him about Margret, the Forsworn, or the guards that are harassing you. Suddenly, there is a disturbance—Thonar will call out to his wife, Betrid, who has fallen victim to Nana Ildene and Donnel, the supposed cleaning crew for the Treasury House. Kill Nana Ildene and Donnel, and then express your sympathies to Thonar. He will curse the Forsworn, and then tell you that he has been controlling them by imprisoning their king Madanach. Madanach has now become ""out of control"", however. The attack on Betrid can be avoided by pickpocketing Thonar's journal without speaking to him. Nepos[edit] When you enter Nepos's house, his housekeeper, Uaile, will step in to keep you from seeing Nepos. However, she is overruled by Nepos, and he invites you in for a chat. Your dialogue choices all end with Nepos admitting that he is indeed Forsworn. When questioned further he will reveal a strong loyalty to ""the King in Rags"", Madanach, from whom he gets his orders. He will give you some history on Madanach's position and political views. Nepos is actually quite verbose in the matter of Madanach, which should by now be making you suspicious. As suspected, Nepos will then inform you that Uaile is actually a Forsworn agent and you won't be getting out of the house alive. Everyone in the household draws their weapons, including Nepos. After the battle, you can find Nepos's journal where he pours out his remorse for his actions. You can also try to pickpocket Nepos's journal to gather the evidence secretly and avoid the fight. Lingering too long after the theft here will result in everyone becoming hostile. An Illusion skill book, Mystery of Talara, Part 4, is in Nepos's bedroom. Do the Time Without Doing the Crime[edit] It's off to Cidhna Mine for you. Return to the shrine of Talos to report back your findings. However, when you arrive Eltrys has been slain by a group of guards, who are now lying in wait for you. ""We warned you, but you just had to go and cause trouble. Now we have to pin all these recent murders on you. Silence witnesses. Work. Work. Work."" Player: ""What did you do to Eltrys?"" Guard: ""Same thing we do with all the other natives who want to change things around here. We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you and Eltrys started snooping around. Well, you wanted to find the man responsible for those killings? You'll have plenty of time with the King in Rags when you're in Cidhna mine [sic]."" Player: ""You're corrupt. Thonar is paying you."" Guard: ""We have a nice arrangement in this city, and we're not letting you get in the way. You have a problem with that? Take it up with Madanach. I'm sure the King in rags and his Forsworn would love to meet you. Now you're coming with us. It's a life sentence in Cidhna Mine for you."" Player: ""Madanach is behind these killings!"" Guard: ""You think you're the only one who knows that? We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you showed up. You'll have plenty of time to take it up with the King in Rags while you're serving a life sentence in Cidhna Mine."" The guards there will now attempt to arrest you. You can try to resist arrest or talk your way out of it; however, you must submit to being jailed in order to advance the quest to No One Escapes Cidhna Mine.  Otherwise... Another route: if you are already a thane before starting this quest, and you pickpocketed Nepos's journal to avoid conflict; you may be able to avoid arrest and/or infamy related to finishing the quest by the following: Go back to the shrine of Talos to meet Eltrys. Allow the main guard there to initiate the dialogue: Guard: ""We warned you... ...Work. Work. Work."" Exit the chat before responding [press B etc]. The guard will immediately re-engage you. Guard: ""You have committed crimes against the Jarl... how do you respond?"" (Or similar dialogue depending on version). Player: ""I am the thane. I demand you release me at once"", to which the guard will apologize, and give the standard response to using thaneship to avoid crimes.  You must then immediately exit the shrine of Talos. If you do not immediately exit the shrine the guard (Presumably realizing his error) tries to re-engage you once again, back down the quest related options of dialogue: jail or resist only, and will immediately attack if you try to exit the dialogue any further. Once exiting, the main guard will follow outside, but will have apparently forgotten about the whole thing once leaving the shrine; as will all of the guards around who will treat you as before the quest started /no bounty or arrest warrant. You can also re-enter the shrine of Talos with this method to loot Eltrys's body after, which will remain in place alongside the other two guards (who will have normal dialogue with you instead of trying to arrest or attack). This route will complete The Forsworn Conspiracy quest without starting No One Escapes Cidhna Mine while keeping you free from the repercussions of finishing The Forsworn Conspiracy quest line. Using this method you will not be able to start the No One Escapes Cidhna Mine quest line. Resisting Arrest[edit] If you resist arrest, several waves of guards will attack you within the shrine.  If you end this combat (either by killing all guards or otherwise), any Markarth City Guard who sees you afterward will attempt to arrest you on sight for ""murder and conspiracy against the city of Markarth"".  When you are arrested with this dialogue, you may be presented with several normally-available choices for escaping arrest (i.e. Thane status, Thieves Guild, bribery), but any choice other than going to jail or resisting arrest is rendered useless. The guards will reject any and all attempts to exonerate the Dragonborn whatever the player tells them. They will then attempt to apprehend the Dragonborn on sight. This is a gameplay script exclusive to this mission. Going to jail will still begin No One Escapes Cidhna Mine.  This arrest-on-sight status will persist permanently in Markarth until you submit to going to jail."

This will make the bodyguard sick. Pickpocket the mark, and steal the family Seal (ring). Impersonate a courier. Defeat the bodyguard. Follow the mark to the treasure hiding place. Defeat the mark.","The Cup of Fortune[edit] Go to sleep After filling the cup labeled ""Fortune"", you will need to find a bed and sleep. There is a convenient bedroll nearby with a quest marker. Go to sleep and after awakening, you will get an update of new items in your inventory. Read the letter called Rogue's Job Offer. In this letter you will learn of a High Elf named Cuinanthil who is a rich mark begging to be robbed. Cuinanthil has just arrived in Markarth with his ever-present Dark Elf bodyguard Inimoro. The rogue lets you know the treasure is being hidden somewhere in the Reach and lays out a plan to get to it. You find out the bodyguard has a weakness for Sujamma, a drink from his homeland. (Optional) The first thing you need to do is create a Spiked Sujamma drink to poison the bodyguard. One of the items left in your inventory is a vial of spiked poison. Sujamma is not sold by any of the traders in Skyrim so you may have to go to Solstheim to get some. After acquiring the Sujamma, go to a cookpot and mix the spiked vial with the Sujamma.  Silver Blood Inn[edit] Cuinanthil and his bodyguard Once you have the spiked drink head to Markarth and talk to the owner of the Silver-Blood Inn and convince him to sell your Sujamma. Your dialogue choices will include several price options to persuade him to buy your drink, or you can just give to him at no cost. He won't refuse free Sujamma so you will always have that option if your Speech skills are not high enough. Cuinanthil and his bodyguard will roam around the inn. The bodyguard will stay close to Cuinanthil at all times. At some point he will take a break and drink the Spiked Sujamma and begin to get violently sick. He will remain this way for a long period of time. While the bodyguard is down, find and pickpocket the ring seal from Cuinanthil. Depending on how long it takes you to pickpocket Cuinanthil, the bodyguard will soon recover after you have successfully stolen the ring seal. Head out of the inn and follow the quest marker to the Warrens and enter the door.  I've been looking for you...[edit] The dead courier Follow the quest marker into the Warrens until you come to the body of a dead courier. Read the note of instructions nearby. They tell you to seal the letter with the ring, dress as the courier, and deliver the fake letter back to Cuinanthil. Be sure to remove all your armor and disguise yourself as the courier. Seal the fake letter and head back to the inn. When you return to Cuinanthil, you must select the dialogue options that all couriers say in order to fool Cuinanthil. Bodyguard in trouble Say, ""I've been looking for you..."" and then, ""Got something I'm supposed to deliver - your hands only."" Cuinanthil will accept your ruse and read the letter. Then he accuses his bodyguard of wrongdoing. The bodyguard will start to fight city guards and civilians trying to escape his fate. You will get a quest update to help the guards kill the bodyguard. Once the bodyguard is dead, Cuinanthil will run out of the inn to check on his treasure. You are to follow him.  Hidden in plain sight[edit] The vault Cuinanthil has taken you back to the Warrens, to a hidden vault deep in the squalor of the derelict district. Follow him into the vault area. While inside you will get a quest update to confront Cuinanthil. At this point the mysterious rogue will enter the vault with you and confront Cuinanthil too. They will fight until Cuinanthil is dead. You will realize after reading Cuinanthil's journal that the two are brothers fighting over a large family fortune. Speak to Ernanthil and, as a reward, you will get a small amount of gold. You can barter and try to get more out of the deal at this point. Killing Ernanthil is allowed after finishing the dialogue. You can steal all the loot at this point."

Talvas is attempting to summon an ash guardian, but is having no luck. Enter the main tower of Tel Mithryn, go up to the main floor, then go back outside. As soon as you leave, you'll see Talvas' summoning has finally worked. He'll run to you in a panic: the ash guardian he got is hostile! You'll have several reply options. However, even if you tell him to clean up his own mess it's no use: the quest will start and the enemy nearby will disable fast travel.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Frostflow_Abyss","Enter the Frostflow Lighthouse. Investigate the lighthouse living areas and read the family's journals. Retrieve the cellar key from the burial urn on the mantle. Search for the remaining family members in Frostflow Abyss. Kill the family's attackers. Take Habd's remains to the lighthouse brazier.","Frostflow Lighthouse[edit] We finally did it. We bought the lighthouse. I thought Habd was just making idle promises all these years, what husband doesn't want to promise their wife the two moons from the sky, but I didn't think we'd actually manage to get it! Now if I could only find where we put everything. When you least expect it On the snowy tundra between Winterhold and Dawnstar stands Frostflow Lighthouse, a remote building overlooking the Sea of Ghosts. It has been abandoned until recently, when a Redguard couple, Habd and Ramati, finally managed to realize their dream of purchasing it, planning to spend their silver years in the lighthouse. The couple brought their two grown children, Sudi and Mani, hoping that eventually they'd decide to stay with their parents. Both children hated the place, but the parents kept hoping they would just stay in the lighthouse for a few years before venturing out into the world on their own. As you approach the lighthouse, a dead horse will block your path, hinting that something went terribly wrong inside. As you enter you will be met with the sight of a dead body lying in the center of the main chamber. A broken table and the bloodstained remains of a chaurus, primitively killed with a woodcutter's axe, are near the fireplace. The quest will immediately initiate and some strange scratching noises will appear from somewhere below. The dead body turns out to be the mother of the family, Ramati, impaled by a Falmer war axe. She carries her husband's journal; read through it and you will discover what happened to Ramati and how Habd managed to kill the chaurus before venturing into the cellar for his children. The Scratching Sounds[edit] Oh gods poor Ramati. It must have come out of the cellar. I'm going down there and locking the door behind me to make sure they don't escape. I don't know if I'll make it out, but I have to save my family! The mantle From Habd's journal, it is clear that the intruders are located downstairs, but the cellar door is locked, so ignore the scratching sounds and investigate a bit further. Start in the northeastern bedroom where Habd and Ramati's double bed is positioned in the center of the room. On the end table sits Ramati's journal so read through it for some more observations and a few clues. Head into the neighboring room to the northwest, belonging to Mani and Sudi, and follow the trail of blood to Mani's bed. Underneath the bed is a knapsack with a letter where he claims not to be responsible for the odd noises coming from the basement, and how he will leave the lighthouse as soon as Habd returns from his venture into town. On a table in the same room is Sudi's journal. Read through the last section of the journal and compare it to the last section of Ramati's journal, and you will know where the cellar key is hidden. Head to the fireplace and investigate the burial urn sitting on the mantle. It contains the cellar key so grab it and loot the lighthouse for valuables, including a copy of the Restoration skill book Mystery of Talara, v2 in the parents' bedroom. Finally approach the cellar door and prepare for a very long trek into the depths beneath the lighthouse, where you will find out what happened to the other family members, Sudi, Mani, and Habd. Head down the stairs and avoid the bear traps laid out by Habd in an attempt to stop the supposed skeevers. Follow the trail of blood down to a snowy chamber where two chaurus will attack, effectively solving the mystery of the scratching sounds. Dispose of them both and keep an eye on the blood in the snow. Halfway through the room, the trail stops, and in front of you is a knocked-over set of shelves. Where the shelves used to stand is a huge hole in the stone wall. Proceed into the tunnel behind the wall and enter Frostflow Abyss. The Blind Dead[edit] I don't know how long we've been down here. Father came down to find us, but those things captured him as well. I asked him if he'd seen Mother or Mani, but I don't know if he could even hear me. One of those big bugs bit him when he tried to get free and now he's feverish. Mani Sudi Head down the slope and discover the recognizable tents usually inhabited by the Falmer. Before long, a Falmer will attack, along with another chaurus. The trail of blood starts again here, leading towards a plateau between the tents. Here, you can find the remains of Mani, skewered by a Falmer sword and roasting on two fires, obviously on his way to become the meal for the inhabitants of the crypt. Locate the gate to the southeast and head up the slope for another battle against a Falmer and a chaurus. Take the narrow tunnel to the southeast and beware the tripwire triggering the slicer in the ceiling. Before long you will land in a nest filled with cobwebs and inhabited by a Falmer and two frostbite spiders. Kill them all and proceed through the southwestern tunnel until you reach another chamber, divided into two levels, with a patrolling Falmer on the ledge above, and another on the ground. Fight them both and investigate the cage along the western wall. In there, you will find Sudi lying dead in a pool of her own blood. A scrawled page is nearby, detailing how far her father managed to get into the cave before he was finally overpowered by the poisonous inhabitants. Sadly, a bloodstained note in her hand explains how she was able to commit suicide before she suffered the same fate as her father, explaining the blood and the iron dagger sticking out of her wrist.  Entering the Nest[edit] They took Father. There had been some others they brought down but they led them off and all we heard were the screams and now Father is gone too. I don't know where he was hiding it, but I think I know why he left me this dagger. The blind dead The Reaper Locate the slope to the southeast and proceed to the area above and fight any remaining Falmer. The only available path is located to the west and marks a point of no return, as you will be unable to get back up. When you drop down, kill the chaurus and examine the Falmer tent for a couple of useful healing potions. Then head forward through the tunnel until you reach yet another point of no return, a large chamber filled with several chaurus enemies, spitting poison at you while you slowly climb down to the bottom using the stones sticking out of the wall. The room is flooded with water and all of the walls are covered in egg sacks filled with chaurus eggs. A total of four chaurus will attack. Kill them and proceed through the tunnel to the northwest until you find yourself in another huge chamber filled with eggs and more chaurus.  With the Dawnguard DLC there are four chaurus cocoons, the third from the left will contain a chaurus hunter fledgling. Locate another slope and another narrow tunnel in the northeastern corner, leading to even more egg sacks, more chaurus, two more chaurus cocoons (with one releasing another chaurus hunter fledgling as you approach) and more fights. As the amount of egg sacks slowly increases and covers the surroundings, prepare for the final battle in the northeastern chamber where a huge chaurus reaper resides, sitting on an island surrounded by egg sacks. Pick the fight with the giant chaurus and keep an eye on your health at all times, as several smaller chaurus will join their leader. Once the reaper is dead, the quest will end, although you still haven't found the head of the family, Habd. Open up the chaurus reaper and you will find Habd's remains inside, along with his lighthouse key. Claim the key and the remains, head up the slope and loot the boss-leveled Falmer chest, then head through the narrow northeastern tunnel until you fall down in the very first chamber of the crypt. Last Wishes[edit] I know they think their father will live forever, but I see his age creeping into his eyes. He made me promise again that when he died I would put his bones in the lighthouse fire so he could look out over the ocean forever. Forever at peace Head northwest and you will be back in Frostflow Lighthouse, with only one thing to do for the family of Redguards, namely to follow Habd's last wishes, as written in his wife's journal. Unlock the wooden door adjacent to the cellar door and travel all the way up to a ladder that leads to the very top of the lighthouse, with the impressive view described by Sudi in her journal. Habd's key will unlock the chest up there, so claim another reward and then head up the wooden ladder to the lighthouse brazier and activate it. Habd's remains will then be placed in the brazier, fulfilling his last wishes, to look out over the ocean forever. This gesture earns you the Sailor's Repose, a permanent effect causing all healing spells to cure 10% more."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Gardener_of_Men","Read the Black Book Epistolary Acumen. Explore the book and learn the second word of the Bend Will shout. Defeat Krosulhah. Talk to Storn in Skaal Village. Learn the final word of Bend Will.","Chapter I[edit] The path opens By reading the Black Book Epistolary Acumen, you are transported to the realm of Hermaeus Mora, Apocrypha. If this is your first trip (not counting the one where you first meet Miraak), Hermaeus Mora will appear, floating above the platform as a tentacled eyeball. He will speak to you of Apocrypha's seductive wealth of knowledge. Chapter I opens on a small platform. As is common in Apocrypha, if you approach the edges, tentacles may reach out of the water and whip you. Activate the scrye at the platform's center to lower a bridge to a moving corridor. Jump onto the moving passage, taking care not to fall into the dark water. The parts of the bridge that bend actually have porous walls; if you do not actively move with the bridge's flexing, you'll pass through these walls and drop into the poisonous water. Hop off at the platform on the far right, then activate a second scrye and lower a second bridge. Jump back into the moving passage and ride it back to that bridge. Read the book on the pedestal here to access Chapter II. Chapter II[edit] Travel down the narrow pathway and activate another scrye. The corridor will unfurl to become the floor of a room, where you battle a lurker and a couple of seekers. Once they are dealt with, activate a scrye on the eastern side of the room in order to open up the large gate to the west. To the southeast is a pod you can loot. Through the gate, to your right is another pod, and right in front of you is Chapter III. Chapter III[edit] The start of Chapter III Follow the pathway around and up several sets of stairs, eliminating the seekers as you go. To the left of your entry point, there is a font of magicka surrounded by a pool of poisonous water that will restore your magicka reserves. There is another one located at the top of the stairs, where you will also encounter a moving tunnel similar to the one encountered in Chapter I. If you choose to get off at the closest platform, you will be greeted by a lurker, and two seekers will fire at you from a platform below. Drop down the far side of the lurker's platform to kill them, then activate a scrye around a corner to the southwest in order to return to the starting platform. The last and farthest platform contains two seekers and a pod full of loot, with a font of magicka hanging on either side. You will find there three skill books: Death Blow of Abernanit, Fire and Darkness, and Orsinium and the Orcs; as well as a Conjure Seeker spell tome. Chapter III & IV To reach Chapter IV, do not jump on the platforms. Instead, activate the scrye at the end of the moving passage to open the gate, and defeat any seekers that appear as you move forward. As soon as you reach the end of the next passage, it will move to the left and a bridge will lower, leading to a lurker. At the end of the path, there will be another move to the left, and you will approach the gates you activated before, but this time from the left side. Activate the scrye to open them again and continue on, avoiding the tentacles that reach out at you from the water. Eliminate the seekers as you walk down the path to Chapter IV. Chapter IV[edit] A Daedric Prince wants to make a deal Be prepared to move quickly; you may spawn in this level standing in a pool of the poison fluid. You may recognize the location below the platform as the setting of Chapter III. Loot the vessel to the left and activate the scrye. The large capsule containing the Black Book: Epistolary Acumen will open. Walk up to the Book and read it to summon Hermaeus Mora. The following dialogue is dependent on the status of the quest Discerning the Transmundane. If the quest has been completed, Hermaeus Mora greets you in one of two ways: If you respected Mora before: ""Well done, my champion. Your journey towards enlightenment has finally led you here, to my realm, as I knew it would."" If you disrespected Mora before: ""You thought to reject me, and yet here you are. Your journey towards enlightenment has finally led you here, to my realm, as I knew it would."" This presents two possible replies: What do you want of me this time?: ""You have entered my realm. You have sought out the forbidden knowledge that only one other has obtained. You are Dragonborn, like Miraak before you. A seeker of knowledge and power."" What do you want of me, my lord?: ""Your progress since obtaining my Oghma Infinium has been rapid. And now, I find you here, following in my servant Miraak's footsteps. You also are Dragonborn. You also seek to learn how to bend the world to your will."" Alternatively, if Discerning the Transmundane has not yet been completed, he will simply greet you with: ""All seekers of knowledge come to my realm, sooner or later."" Either way, the following set of dialogue choices becomes available, where he reveals that you cannot hope to surpass Miraak without the last word of power: Yes, I came here to learn Miraak's secrets: ""All that he knows he learned from me."" I won't serve you, monster. I just want to defeat Miraak: ""You will serve me, willing or not. All who seek after the secrets of the world are my servants."" I don't need your help. I'll learn Miraak's secrets on my own: ""No, look around. You have done nothing here on your own. You could spend a hundred lifetimes searching my library, and you will never find what you seek."" Tell me what you want my lord, and I will bring it to you: ""You please me champion. Your loyalty will be richly rewarded. The Skaal have withheld their secrets from me for many long years. The time has come for this knowledge to be added to my library."" Regardless of what option is chosen, Hermaeus Mora ends with: ""I know what you want: to use your power as Dragonborn to bend the world to your will. Here then is the knowledge you need, although you did not know you needed it. The second Word of Power. Use it to bend the wills of mortals to your purpose. But this is not enough. Miraak knows the final Word of Power. Without that, you cannot hope to surpass him. Miraak served me well, and he was rewarded. I can grant you the same power as he wields, but all knowledge has its price."" Next, he reveals his price for the Word of Power, knowledge for knowledge: Tell me what you want my lord, and I will bring it to you: ""You please me champion. Your loyalty will be richly rewarded. The Skaal have withheld their secrets from me for many long years. The time has come for this knowledge to be added to my library."" So what's your price for the final Word of Power?: ""Knowledge for knowledge. The Skaal have withheld their secrets from me for many long years. The time has come for this knowledge to be added to my library."" Why do I need this Word of Power to defeat Miraak?: ""Even dragons submit to Miraak's Voice. Without that power, you cannot face him. So say I, Hermaeus Mora, master of the Tides of fate."" Isn't Miraak your ally? Why help me defeat him?: ""He has served me long and well. But he grows restless under my guidance. His desire to return to your world will spread my influence more widely. But it will also set him free from my direct control. It may be time to replace him with a more loyal servant. One who still appreciates the gifts I have to offer."" After this section, the conversation ends with the following set of options: I will talk to the Skaal and bring you their secrets: ""I know you will. And then I will give you the knowledge that you seek."" I will do as you command, my lord: ""Yes, I know. And then Miraak's power will be yours as well."" What if the Skaal refuse to give up their secrets?: ""My servant Miraak would have found a way to bring me what I want. So will you if you wish to surpass him."" How do I know I can trust you, demon?: ""My word is as true as fate, as inevitable as destiny. Bring me what I want, and I will give you what you seek."" Regardless of what option is chosen, Hermaeus Mora parts with: ""Send the Skaal shaman to me. He holds the secrets that will be mine."", referring to Storn Crag-Strider. Just before Hermaeus Mora fades away, he teaches you the second word to Bend Will. After this, you may choose from one of three powers emanating from the Black Book: Dragonborn Flame — When your Fire Breath shout kills an enemy, a Fire Wyrm emerges from the corpse to fight for you for 60 seconds. Dragonborn Force — Your Unrelenting Force shout does more damage and may disintegrate enemies. Dragonborn Frost — Your Frost Breath shout encases foes in ice. Only one ability from the book may be accepted at a time. To return to Solstheim, use the Black Book in front of you or access it from your inventory. Return to Solstheim[edit] ""What happened? What did you see?"" Krosulhah attacking upon your exit After reading the book, you are returned to Nchardak, where Neloth will approach and ask: ""What happened? What did you see? Different people have very different experiences when reading these books."" You can give him two possible answers: I talked to Hermaeus Mora: ""You're still acting surprisingly sane, too. What did he have to say? He must have wanted something from you."" I learned the second Word of the Bend Will shout: ""No wonder the Dwemer were so interested in that book. It was indeed one that Miraak used to advance his power as Dragonborn. But I assume there's some bad news? It would be unlike Hermaeus Mora to allow anyone to gain such knowledge without exacting a price."" If you explain to Neloth that Hermaeus Mora wants the ""secrets of the Skaal"" in exchange for the third word, Neloth replies: ""Hmph. What secrets could they have worth keeping from old Mora? Sounds like a bargain to me. Hermaeus Mora learns some fascinating new ways to skin a horker and you become the second most powerful Dragonborn that ever lived. Well, that gives me a lot to think about. I need to get back to Tel Mithryn. I have some ideas about how to locate more of these Black Books..."" Alternatively, should you die within Apocrypha before speaking to Hermaeus Mora, a different option is presented: I found myself in another place: ""That's a fairly common experience, at least for those who remain coherent enough to report what they've seen. You were in Apocrypha. Or at least your consciousness was - your body remained here of course. You should read the book again until you reach what appears to be the ""end"" - then you will have fully understood the knowledge it contains."" After this, if you return to Apocrypha and come back, Neloth will ask with skepticism: ""Did you actually learn what you needed to know by reading that black book?"" Regardless, when Neloth leaves, you can go back downstairs for the five cubes, which have a base value of 50 gold; they are just minor loot at this point. After exiting Nchardak, it is revealed that Miraak has sent a dragon named Krosulhah to ambush you. He hovers above the ruins and bellows: ""Miraak has commanded your death. So it shall be."" before attacking. Fight and defeat him, and once he is dead, travel to the Skaal Village and talk to Storn, who can be found meditating outside his hut. The Secrets of the Skaal[edit] ""So it falls to me to be the one to give up the secrets to our ancient enemy."" If you have yet to cleanse the All-Maker Stones, Storn will say that he is too weak to face Hermaeus Mora, as the Oneness of the land is disrupted. You will need to complete the related quest to restore the shaman's connection to the All-Maker before he will agree to help you. Once the Sacred Stones have been cleansed, return to Storn and ask him about the secrets of the Skaal, to which he replies: ""Hermaeus Mora... old Herma-Mora himself. So he is the source of Miraak's power. Of course. We have many tales of Herma-Mora trying to trick us into giving up our secrets to him. And now he comes again for what we have long kept from him."" Next, three optional questions become available, each of which give additional insight into the relationship between the Skaal and Hermaeus Mora: What are the ""secrets of the Skaal""?: ""Ancient lore, handed down from shaman to shaman since the All-Maker first gave Solstheim to the Skaal. How to talk to the wind, how to listen to the earth - these are our secrets. Nothing of power or mastery."" Why would Hermaeus Mora want your secrets?: ""We know him as Herma-Mora, the Demon of Knowledge. It is in his nature to hoard secrets to himself. Their value to him is of no consequence. The very fact that the Skaal have kept knowledge from him has merely increased his desire to have it."" Herma-Mora? Why do you call him that?: ""That is our name for him - the Demon of knowledge. He has always been our enemy."" Back to the matter at hand, the following set of options are presented: He said it's the only way he'll teach me the final Word of Miraak's Shout: Storn's Reply  Condition   ""So it falls to me to be the one to give up the secrets to our ancient enemy. I do not know if I have the strength to face him. The Tree Stone is still corrupted... the land is still out of balance. But with the other five restored... it may be enough. It will have to do.""  Cleansing the Stones is complete   ""So it falls to me to be the one to give up the secrets to our ancient enemy. I do not know if I have the strength to face him. With Miraak's corruption of the Stones... the Oneness of the land is disrupted, and our connection to the All-Maker is broken.""  Cleansing the Stones is incomplete You mean you'll give him what he wants?: ""Yes. The Skaal also tell of the day when we must finally give up our secrets. When Herma-Mora finally wins. As shaman, it is my duty to guard these secrets, but also to decide when it is necessary to give them up. I believe that time is now. If I am wrong, may my ancestors forgive me. Give me the book. I will read it, and speak to old Herma-Mora myself. I will make sure he lives up to his part of the bargain."" I hope you know what you're doing. (Give book): ""That is my hope as well. I am trusting you will make this sacrifice worthwhile."" ""Father, you must not do this. That book is... wrong. Evil."" When you hand him the book he will walk into the center of the village, while Frea will shout: Frea: ""Father, you must not do this. That book is... wrong. Evil. Against everything that you have taught me my whole life.""   Storn: ""I must, Frea. It is the only way to free Solstheim forever from Miraak's shadow. There comes a time when everything must change. Nothing that lives remains the same forever. Do not fear for me, my daughter. This is the destiny that the All-Maker has laid out for me.""   Frea: ""I stand beside you, father, as always.""   Storn: ""I am ready for whatever the foul master of this book has in store for me."" ""You... liar... gah! ... I won't... not... for you..."" While seemingly unconvinced about Hermaeus Mora's intentions and promises, Storn then opens the book. Seconds after, several tentacles shoot out from its pages and grab him, one of them piercing into his brain, while Mora gloats:  ""At last, the Skaal yield up their secrets to me."" While the secrets of the Skaal are drained out of him, all Storn can utter is: ""You... liar... gah! ... I won't... not... for you..."" Hermaeus Mora will then speak to you: ""Dragonborn, you have delivered me the gift I requested. In return, I keep my promise, as befits a Prince of Oblivion: I give you the Word of Power that you need to challenge Miraak. You will be either a worthy opponent or his successor, as the tides of fate decree."" When you finally receive your gift, Mora will let go of Storn who will shout: ""Nooo!"" and fall to the ground, dead. Frea will rush to her father's lifeless body and cry out: ""Father! What have you done!"" She will then look directly at you: ""Go. My father sacrificed himself so that you could destroy Miraak and lift his master's shadow from the land. Go, then. Kill Miraak. Do not fail."" At this point it would be wise to take Epistolary Acumen from Storn Crag-Strider's body before entering Apocrypha to confront Miraak. If you fail to do this and exit the area with only Waking Dreams in you inventory, his body will not be there when you return, the book will not be there, and you will not be able to change the Dragonborn power you selected again. She will then stay by her father, while all the citizens of Skaal Village pay their final respect to their old shaman: ""We won't forget what you did for us, Storn Crag-Strider."" Fanari Strong-Voice: ""Goodbye, old friend. We will miss you, but do not worry. Frea will guide us well, thanks to you."" Edla: ""We won't forget what you did for us, Storn Crag-Strider. Walk with the All-Maker."" Deor Woodcutter: ""Frea... I'm sorry."" Aeta: ""It can't be... please, All-Maker, send him back to us..."" Baldor Iron-Shaper: ""I... uh... you'll be missed, old man."" Finna: ""May the All-Maker guide your soul to the next life."" Nikulas: ""Frea... what happened? What was that thing? I thought the village was safe now."" Wulf Wild-Blood: ""Return to the All-Maker, old one. The Skaal will never forget your sacrifice."" Morwen: ""I don't really understand what you did, but I trust you did it for the good of the village. So... thank you."" Tharstan: ""By the gods... I've never seen anything like it... I, uh... I don't think this will go in my book."" This ends the quest, and starts At the Summit of Apocrypha."

A siege seemed impossible, as Hjalti could expect no reinforcements from Falkreath."" Tiber Septim's Bed[edit] Old Hroldan Inn, the remote inn along the shores of Karth River in the Reach, holds an important place in history, at least according to innkeeper, Eydis. As soon as you enter the taproom she will claim, ""Old Hroldan is the stone that the Empire's history is built on"" and will then ask if you want to rent Tiber Septim's bed. When asked to elaborate Eydis will provide a lengthy description on the historical importance of Old Hroldan. She will explain the location marks Tiber Septim's first victorious battle when he liberated the area from barbarians during the Second Era. According to history, the victorious general then spent the night at the inn and his bed is still there, as good as new. Eydis charges a meager ten gold for renting out the venerable bed, so accept the offer and follow her to the room. Note the skill book The Battle of Sancre Tor on the nightstand, then go to bed. Ghost of Old Hroldan[edit] ""You promised me, Hjalti."" When you wake up, you will hear Eydis scream in terror as the inn has received an unexpected visitor, namely the Ghost of Old Hroldan. An alarmed Eydis will tell tales about Old Hroldan being haunted, but will not have definitive answers about the ghost or his purpose. Instead, go talk to the ghost who will confuse you with someone else: ""Hjalti? Is that you? I've been waiting."" ""I fought by your side. To take back the Reach from the savages."" ""Do you remember me now, Hjalti?"" When asked about why he is referring to you as 'Hjalti' he will remind you that the two of you fought together to free Hroldan, and that you promised to be his sworn brother. He then explains that he has waited an eternity for the sword that will fulfill the promise, but will not reveal anything else. Hjalti's Sword[edit] Ask Eydis about the sword, and once again, she knows her history. She will recall a legend about Tiber Septim attacking a camp right before heading to Hroldan. Her guess is that the sword will be at the camp. She will then mark a random location on your map, choosing from the following list: Possible Locations: Broken Tower Redoubt • Bruca's Leap Redoubt • Deepwood Redoubt • Dragon Bridge Overlook • Druadach Redoubt • Hag Rock Redoubt • Red Eagle Redoubt • Serpent's Bluff Redoubt If asked further, Eydis will speculate on the name 'Hjalti' and guess that it was one of the many names of Tiber Septim. She suggests that the ghost is one of Tiber Septim's dead soldiers. Sworn Brothers[edit] Luckily, Eydis' map marker will show you all the way to the boss-leveled chest in the depths of the random location. Once you have Hjalti's Sword return to Old Hroldan Inn and present the sword to the ghost. He will be most honored to become your 'sworn brother' after hundreds of years and reward you with a few lessons from the sword masters of Alcaire: a one-point bonus to your One-handed and Block skills.

Travel to Ashfall's Tear. (?)","Fahlbtharz Forge and the heretic The ALMSIVI puzzle To begin this quest, read the Heretic Dossier: Blacksmith's Confessional at the Temple in Raven Rock. It can be found on a table in the first room on the right on the lower floors of the temple. You will then have to travel to Fahlbtharz and enter the Forge. Inside you will find Hand Kenro Hlan, he will be hostile and you will have to kill him. Once he is dealt with, search his body to find a note, Unenchanted Weapon, Kenro's Helmet and Kenro's Robes. Picking up these items will also start Trueflame (quest). You will then need to head to Ashfall's Tear, once inside you will find a ALMSIVI puzzle. The correct order for the stone pillars is ASV. If you decide to wear Kenro's helmet and robes and infiltrate the temple ranks, the ordinators at the door will not be hostile, however, if you are not wearing these, they will attack on sight. Joining the Heretics[edit] If you disguise yourself, you can peacefully talk to Matriarch Drevlan and either persuade or prove yourself by fighting Almalexia's Hands: I'm actually not one of your followers. But I'd still like to join your ranks. ""You expect me to believe that?"" I could prove my loyalty by praying to the Goddess. (Persuade). ""Okay, okay, you've talked me into it."" If I bested your warriors in combat, it would show the Goddess favors me. ""How can I argue with that?"" If you manage to persuade her you will have to pray at the nearby Shrine of Almalexia next to the large statue at the temple entrance. Doing so acts as praying at any other shrine, curing diseases and replacing any active blessing with Almalexia's Blessing. This blessing grants +10 to the Heavy Armor skill and +10% damage with One-Handed weapons for 8 hours. Once you've prayed at the shrine, you've joined the heretics and can continue on to the next stage of the quest. If you want to prove yourself through combat, you will have to fight Hand Kydren Indobar until he submits, then Hand Ethra Mavandas, Watchman Sindras and finally Vesparth the Toe. After this you will need to speak to Drevlan again: I've won the combat trial. I trust this means I have her favor? ""The deed is done. We need speak of it no longer."" After this point, you are now accepted. You are free to switch back to your other apparel if you want. Speak to Drevlan again to continue. I await the Goddess' command. Her word is our law. ""You speak the truth."" Does the Goddess have a task for me? ""Of course. It's all in this note."" She will then hand you a note detailing your task and the location of the other masks. Reading the note will begin three quests: Her Word Against TheirsCC: Spread the word of the Goddess Almalexia. Buyer BewareCC: Ambush a meeting to retrieve the Mask of Vivec. Careless CurationCC: Find the missing Curate to retrieve the Mask of Sotha Sil. Ash zombies Once you return to the temple you will have to clear out the ash zombies that are attacking the temple, once they are dealt with you will need to speak to the Matriarch: (?) She will reward you with the Tribunal Armory Key.  Destroying the Heretics[edit] If you decide to destroy the heretics, you can disguise yourself still in order to speak to Matriarch Drevlan, or you can just deal with them the traditional way. If you choose the traditional way, you will have to first fight the two ordinators that guard the first door into the temple. You will then have to fight everyone gathered in the ritual room past the statue.  There is a narrow straight tunnel before the room.  It is possible to fight everyone in the room one on one at this choke point. You will still be able to complete the other Ghost of the Tribunal Quests by looting the bodies for notes.  There is no key to the armory however and this prevents you from obtaining Skullcrusher.  The other cases are unlocked however. You will still have to fight the Ash Zombies and if you return to Ashfall Tear after that, you will find the Reclamation Priest with three Redoran Guards investigating the scene while sadly saying ""Almsivi"" to themselves.  They will ask what you want but no dialogue will be available. You will have all four masks, not replicas, but they have no associated magical qualities."

The Letter to General Tullius can be found on the ground floor of Castle Dour in the room to the north of General Tullius's map room. You are only required to read the letter to start the quest; taking it counts as theft, so be sure that you are not seen if you decide to take it with you. The letter reveals that the Lord's Mail, a legendary Imperial Legion artifact, has been stolen by a band of Alik'r mercenaries who were last seen south of Fort Greymoor in Whiterun Hold. The Alik'r camp is actually located southeast of Fort Greymoor, and is home to two generic Alik'r mercenaries led by Majid the Mad. Taking on all three at once can be a tough fight, so prepare accordingly. Once the mercenaries lie dead, recover the Key to Alik'r Mercenary Chest from Majid's body and use it to open the nearby chest.

Blessing of Kynareth[edit] In order to remove the curse from the Lord's Mail, you will need to seek the blessing of its mythic creator, Kynareth. This will necessitate a return to Solitude to visit the Shrine of Kynareth in the Temple of the Divines. Upon activating the shrine, you will be informed that ""The Lord's Mail has been cleansed"". This concludes the quest and rewards you with a set of heavy ebony armor with poison resistance, magic resistance, as well as a unique area effect that inflicts 5 points of health absorbance per second on nearby opponents.

Release Kodlak.","The Funeral[edit]  After the events of Purity of Revenge, Vilkas will run towards the Skyforge to participate in the late Harbinger Kodlak Whitemane's funeral. The ceremony is to be held near Eorlund Gray-Mane's smithy. All of the Companions will be present, along with the Jarl, steward and the local priestess of Kynareth. Kodlak is placed above the forge, and the ceremony ends with Aela the Huntress lighting the fire, symbolizing a final goodbye: Eorlund: ""Who will start?"" Aela: ""I'll do it. Before the ancient flame..."" Everyone: ""We grieve."" Eorlund: ""At this loss..."" Everyone: ""We weep."" Vilkas: ""For the fallen..."" Everyone: ""We shout."" Farkas: ""And for ourselves..."" Everyone: ""We take our leave."" After the ritual, Eorlund will seek you out, asking for the fragments of Wuuthrad and Kodlak's secret fragment from his chambers. Retrieve the fragment from the end table in his room. Kodlak's Journal, also in the end table, offers some insights on him and his visions. Return to Eorlund with the fragment. When he accepts it, he will inform you that your Shield-Siblings have gone to the Underforge for a gathering and suggests you join them: ""Thank you. Your Shield-Siblings have withdrawn to the Underforge. I think they're waiting for you.""  Wuuthrad Finally Returned![edit] ""Just because something is, doesn't mean it must be."" In the Underforge you will find the three members of the Circle, Farkas, Vilkas and Aela, talking around the blood fountain, all of them frustrated and discouraged. They all know that Kodlak died without being granted his only wish, namely to be freed of his lycanthropy so he could spend his afterlife in Sovngarde. While they know of a way to cleanse his soul, it requires them to enter the Ysgramor's Tomb and perform a ceremony: Vilkas: ""The old man had one wish before he died. And he didn't get it. It's as simple as that."" Aela: ""Being moon-born is not so much of a curse as you might think, Vilkas."" Vilkas: ""That's fine for you. But he wanted to be clean. He wanted to meet Ysgramor and know the glories of Sovngarde. But all that was taken from him."" Aela: ""And you avenged him."" Farkas: ""Kodlak did not care for vengeance."" Vilkas: ""No, Farkas, he didn't. And that's not what this is about. We should be honoring Kodlak, no matter our own thoughts on the blood."" Aela: ""You're right. It's what he wanted, and he deserved to have it."" Vilkas: ""Kodlak used to speak of a way to cleanse his soul, even in death. You know the legends of the Tomb of Ysgramor."" Aela: ""There the souls of the Harbingers will heed the call of northern steel. We can't even enter the tomb without Wuuthrad, and it's in pieces, like it has been for a thousand years."" At this point, Eorlund Gray-Mane enters with the repaired Wuuthrad on his back: Eorlund: ""And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim. Just because something is, doesn't mean it must be. The blade is a weapon. A tool. Tools are meant to be broken. And repaired."" Vilkas: ""Is that? Did you repair the blade?"" Eorlund: ""This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Brother/Shield-Sister here. ""The flames of a hero can reforge the shattered."" The flames of Kodlak shall fuel the rebirth of Wuuthrad. And now it will take you to meet him once more."" He will then address you personally: ""As the one who bore the fragments, I think you should be the one to carry Wuuthrad into battle."" He will then hand you the weapon and speak to the other members: ""The rest of you, prepare to journey to the Tomb of Ysgramor. For Kodlak."" Your allies will then take off towards the legendary Ysgramor's Tomb. Ghosts of the Companions[edit] The Ysgramor statue A final request from Kodlak Sovngarde awaits. As soon as you enter the tomb, Vilkas will approach and warn you about the dangers that lie ahead. He also says he will take no part in the task, as he has too much grief in his heart. Activate the Ysgramor statue, which will take Wuuthrad from your inventory, and place it on the statue to lower the wall. You may reclaim Wuuthrad by activating the statue again, and the wall will remain open. Followed by Aela the Huntress and Farkas, two skeevers greet you as you head north into the tomb. Continue down, and follow the path around until you are heading west into the next chamber with several Companion ghosts who taunt and warn of your impending death. They attack with Ancient Nord Bows, Swords, and Battle Axes, but their loot will disappear quickly if not searched immediately. Now head south until you enter a large room, with more tombs encircling a pond. Here one or two more ghostly apparitions test your courage before moving deeper into the tomb. Going west up the small stairs past the tombs, you encounter a spider web to the south that must be broken through to continue. It is here that Farkas reveals that, ""Ever since Dustman's Cairn, the big crawly ones are my weakness"". Consequently, he will proceed no further and instead runs back to join Vilkas at the statue. With Aela the Huntress as your only ally now, hack your way through the spider webs and face a Giant Frostbite spider, and many poison-spitting frostbite spiders. Follow the stairs down past the white caps into the next area. Two more companion ghosts await you, and after finishing them off, search the draugr laid out on the tables for valuables, and a potion of stamina beside the wrapped body. Be sure to search the draugr skeletons in their tombs for leveled weapons and armor. Heading east up the small stairs, open the next iron door and you'll enter an area with draugr tombs to your right, but a closed gate to your left. Activating the pedestal will open the closed gate. Enter this chamber heading north, where four more ghosts await shooting arrows, and wielding both one and two-handed weapons. Dispose of them, and find the Two-handed skill book The Legendary Sancre Tor in the center of the room next to the burial urns. Up the stone stairs and through this final iron door. The Trip to Sovngarde[edit] You will find the ghost of Kodlak Whitemane warming his hands near the Flame of the Harbinger. After explaining that the room is, in fact, swarming with the ghosts of his predecessors, whom you can't see, he will ask you if you still own the  Glenmoril Witch heads. He will then ask you to toss one into the Flame, in an attempt to cure him of his werewolf curse. After doing so, Kodlak's wolf spirit will be released and immediately attack. After the battle, Kodlak will thank you and name you the new leader of the Companions. He will then travel to Sovngarde and finally find his peace, completing the quest. Harbinger of the Companions[edit] You can now speak to Aela, who will recognize your new position and tell you she is going to stay in the tomb for a while longer, for further studies. If you linger there, Vilkas and Farkas will arrive and also say they want to stay. All three will then become available as followers. You can cure yourself of lycanthropy before you leave the tomb if you wish. If you don't, you will be required to cure two other Companions of their lycanthropy before you will again have the option to do so. Consider that choosing to remain a werewolf is the only way to access the quest Totems of Hircine, which grants unique abilities you may use while in beast form. You may come back to cure your lycanthropy later. To cure yourself now, throw another Glenmoril Witch head into the fire. Your wolf spirit will emerge. Kill it to rid yourself of being a werewolf permanently. If Aela, Vilkas or Farkas are around, they will aid in the fight. After you've finished, continue up the spiral wooden stairs and locate the chest on the northeastern ledge to claim the Shield of Ysgramor, along with some other valuable loot, then exit through the nearby door by activating a chain. Go up the stairs, and through another short hallway before arriving at another wall with a chain. Pulling the chain opens the wall to the first chamber in the tomb as well as the wall on the opposite side. Before leaving the tomb, you can take Wuuthrad from Ysgramor's statue if you didn't earlier. Exit the tomb through the Western (W) passageway, which was previously inaccessible. Follow the set of stairs outside up the mountain to discover a word wall which teaches part of the Animal Allegiance shout. Directly north (to the right) of the word wall is a gold ore vein.

Note: The events of this quest are closely related to those in the quest Bleak Falls Barrow, at times taking over important objectives. It can be triggered right after entering Riverwood, but it is recommended to follow the intended path and initiate the Bleak Falls Barrow quest in Whiterun. Otherwise, you may miss a few story-related events and details. See this section for details.","A Stolen Heirloom[edit] In Riverwood, you may hear concerned townsfolk talk about a recent robbery at Riverwood Trader. When you pay a visit to the store you will find proprietor Lucan Valerius and his sister Camilla in the middle of a hefty argument, both of them frustrated with recent events. Talking to Camilla will not help much, while Lucan will be more informative, although puzzled: ""Yes, we did have a bit of a... break-in. But we still have plenty to sell. Robbers were only after one thing. An ornament, solid gold. In the shape of a dragon's claw."" If you offer to help him get the claw back, he will offer a gold reward and will then continue debating with Camilla. She will argue that you may need a pointer in the right direction and will then get up and leave. Follow her outside and she will point out Bleak Falls Barrow, barely visible in the distance behind Alvor and Sigrid's House, and lead you to the bridge northeast of town. She will provide some sparse directions, but follow her advice and pick the northwestern trail up the mountain. At this point, make sure you have the concurrent quest in your journal. If not, you can go to Whiterun and activate it. If you don't want to go through the introduction at Riverwood Trader, go straight to Bleak Falls Barrow and you will receive the quest when you overhear two bandits in the first room. Retrieving the Claw[edit] ""Cut me down before that thing gets us!"" When you arrive at Bleak Falls Temple, you may overhear two bandits talking about a Dark Elf that's gone on ahead. If you did not speak to Valerius in Riverwood, this moment serves as the start of the quest. After killing these two bandits and progressing further into the barrow, you will see another bandit approaching a gate. Upon activating the lever for the gate, the bandit is killed by poisonous darts and the gate remains closed, blocking your progress. Notice the broken piece of rock next to the lever. It has the image of a snake. Notice the spinning symbols behind you to the left. These rocks must be rotated to the correct position to activate the lever. Look up to see the carvings on the wall that denote the correct sequence: Snake, Snake, Whale. (The middle rock has fallen off the wall and onto the ground, hence the snake being the right solution.) Continue through the gate and descend the wooden spiral staircase to your left. Three skeevers will emerge and attack, but they shouldn't pose a problem. As you progress further, you will hear Arvel the Swift calling out for help. Some webs block your path; cut through them to proceed. When you find the thief, Arvel the Swift, he will be trapped in a spider web by a Wounded Frostbite Spider. Kill the spider and talk to Arvel. Arvel claims that he will give you the claw if you free him from the web. Once you free him, Arvel will flee, forcing you to pursue him deeper into the dungeon. Alternatively, if the spider is too strong for you, you can just free him from the web and pursue the fleeing Arvel. You can also retreat out of the room to recover, as the spider is too big to leave. If you overtake Arvel quickly, you can kill him yourself; otherwise, he will soon run into a group of draugr, who will likely eliminate him easily. If you protect him from the draugr, he may be killed by the spike trap up ahead. The spike trap will reset after use, and can be activated again to help deal with the draugr. You can loot the claw and a journal from Arvel's body. The journal hints that the claw is actually a key of some sort. Find the Secret of Bleak Falls Barrow[edit] The palm of your hand Although you have found the golden claw, you cannot return it to Lucan until you find the secret of Bleak Falls Barrow, so continue through the chambers. After a while you will find yourself in what appears to be a burial tomb and you will have to fight your way through a group of draugr. If you have not killed Arvel by the time he reaches this room, the draugr will likely kill him. Continue on until you find a puzzle door with three animal seals on it. The claw is the key, however it will not open the door like a regular key would. Instead, examine the claw in your inventory and you will see several symbols engraved in it, palm side up. Set each ring to the correct seal and open the door. From the outermost to the innermost ring, the solution is Bear—Moth—Owl. When you enter the door, follow the tunnel until you find yourself in a large, open room with waterfalls. You will see a Word Wall. When you approach it, one word will stand out, and your character will learn a Word of Power, Fus. A level-dependent creature (at low levels a Draugr Overlord and at higher levels a Dragon Priest) will then rise out of a coffin and you will have to kill it. Leave the dungeon and return to the village. To leave the dungeon, climb to the top of the stairs and activate the lever on the pedestal. There are three chests in this room where you obtain the Word of Power; one centered by the sleeping draugr is quite well seen and unlocked. The second is behind the waterfall on the left. The third has a novice lock and is located to your right behind the waterfall. To find it, go across the bridge but not up the steps leading to the wall, go right along the river path to the bigger waterfall, you will have to jump around on the large stones to the right of the waterfall to gain access to the chest. You will see the chest nesting among the rocks behind the waterfall when in third person view. Return the Claw[edit] If you return the Golden Claw, Lucan or Camilla will give you a leveled amount of gold, increase their disposition toward you to ""friend"" (assuming you previously were not), and return the item to its home on the counter. Levels Reward   1–9 400   10–19 600   20–29 800   30–39 1,000   40+ 1,200"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Good_Intentions","Speak with Tolfdir. Listen to Tolfdir. Follow Ancano. Speak with Quaranir. Find the Augur of Dunlain. Report to Savos Aren.","An Orb Worth Noting[edit] Quaranir freezing time to speak with you After your conversation with Urag gro-Shub about the newly recovered books, the librarian suggests you speak with Tolfdir about the findings. Tolfdir can be found in the Hall of the Elements, in deep rumination about the orb from Saarthal, or the Eye of Magnus. Let him know about your findings and he will begin to discuss the Eye with you. He will explain how the markings seem to be unique, as they do not appear to be Elven, Daedric, or Ayleid. Ancano will interrupt Tolfdir's musings and demand that you follow him to meet a mysterious visitor who has asked to speak with you. A Moment in Time[edit] Follow Ancano to the Arch-Mage's quarters and you will meet Quaranir, another representative from the Psijic Order. Quaranir will freeze time in order to speak privately with you. He will explain that you must prevent anyone from using the Eye of Magnus, as he fears the consequences its misuse will bring. He will suggest that you seek out the Augur of Dunlain within the College, who may be able to give you better guidance. Quaranir will then unfreeze time and leave, confusing Savos and angering Ancano. Speaking to the various mages about the Augur will lead you to either Tolfdir or Mirabelle Ervine for more information. Tolfdir will tell you about the Augur immediately, but you must pass an easy-level Speech check to convince Mirabelle. Either way, you will learn that the Augur is a former student at the College, but something befell him as a result of his own ambitions. He can now be found in The Midden in his altered state. The Augur of Dunlain The Unearthing[edit] You can access the Midden from a trap door in the northern corner of the courtyard or by the stairwell in the Hall of Countenance. Making your way to the Augur of Dunlain is relatively easy; you will likely encounter a few ice wraiths and frostbite spiders, along with a small number of draugr and skeletons. Proceed into The Midden Dark and continue until you reach a locked door. When you approach it, the Augur will warn you from the other side that your efforts will only end in disappointment. The door will then open. The Augur[edit] The Augur will inform you that others (including Ancano) have previously sought information about the Eye of Magnus without realizing the dangers it poses.  While the Augur speaks only of disaster for the Thalmor, he seems encouraged by your path and offers to help you further. He will then inform you that you will need the Staff of Magnus to avert the disaster the Psijics warned you about, and urges you to share this information with Savos Aren. More than a Mere Apprentice[edit] Speak to Savos and inform him of the Augur's message. It takes a bit of convincing to get Savos motivated and interested in this turn of events. Eventually, he will direct you to Mirabelle Ervine for more information on the Staff and then give you the Mage's Circlet, impressed with your performance thus far."

Obtain the deed from Erikur's House and find the barrel behind The Winking Skeever. Locate the key in Silverdrift Lair and retrieve the Ancestral Sword of Clan Ice-Blade. Bring the deed and the sword back to the Riften graveyard for your reward.","The Gray Cowl[edit] To begin this quest, you must make your way to the Riften graveyard and defend yourself from a confused thief who will attack you on sight (or, if the guards see him before you do, they may kill him and you will get the quest notification to loot his body before you ever found him). He has apparently come to the graveyard following rumors that the Gray Fox, the legendary leader of the Thieves Guild, is buried there together with the Gray Cowl, a Daedric artifact stolen from Nocturnal herself. Kill the thief and read the note on his body to learn that he was an acquaintance of the previous Gray Fox, who had died and therefore passed on his Cowl. It seems this thief had the same idea as you and sought to check the grave. The note also mentions a code phrase to use on the town beggars: ""Shadow hide you."" Track down either Edda or Snilf and say the phrase to be passed a note from a Stranger. This individual is offering you a job, provided you can break into the strongbox upstairs in Bolli's House for further instructions. You can try to Persuade or Intimidate his wife Nivenor into giving you the key by telling her a thief planted something inside, or you can just pick the lock yourself. Within, you will find a forged deed, Nivenor's Journal, and Stranger's Instructions. You can also find a note labeled Requested Report on an end table in his house for more insight to what is happening. You will need to read the instructions to begin the next stage of the job. The Solitude Job[edit] You are instructed to take the forged deed to Solitude and break into Erikur's House, where you will steal the real land title and deed and replace it with the fake one. However, with a little snooping around the house, you will be pointed towards a Letter to Gisli, which reveals that Gisli and her associates used a young boy as a political puppet in Jehanna to approve land transfers as the most senior member of the Ice-Blade clan, before shipping him off to Riften. If you confront Gisli with this information, you can offer to buy the deed off her for 8,000 gold, or you can attempt to Persuade her with high Speech skill, without ever needing the forged document. You can also simply pickpocket her. A stranger in the flesh Once you have the original deed in hand, head to a barrel behind The Winking Skeever for your next set of instructions. Stranger's Final Instructions promises to introduce you to the Gray Fox if you enter Silverdrift Lair and recover the Ancestral Sword of Clan Ice-Blade. The sword can be found in a locked chest deep inside the dungeon. Though you can just pick open the lock, you can find the key in the next room to the north on the body of a dead draugr. This corpse is distinguished by a lit lantern placed behind it, as well as two ""Loot"" shadowmarks above it. The chest also contains a document describing the sword, as well as boss-level loot. Meeting with a Stranger[edit] After you have exited the dungeon with the Ancestral Sword, you will need to return to the Riften graveyard and locate the Gray Fox's tombstone. There, you will find the Stranger's Journal, revealing that the current Gray Fox is in fact the true heir of the Ice-Blade clan. After Gisli's associates poisoned his sister and endangered her orphan son, he knew he had to pass on the Cowl to someone else and return to his old life. The journal ends there, but after reading it you will be immediately confronted by none other than the Gray Fox himself. He will take the sword and the deed from your possession, granting you the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal in return. Having passed on the mantle, the Stranger's true identity is revealed to be Pjofr Ice-Blade, accompanied by his now-rescued nephew Smaref Ice-Blade. On the promise that you not breathe a word of these events to anyone, Pjofr and his charge depart for Jehanna, leaving you with a powerful enchanted light helmet. Just be sure not to equip the Cowl in the middle of town, as it will turn all guards hostile if they see you wearing it."

When asked if she works her forge all day, Adrianne will admit that she does, and that she recently forged a greatsword for Jarl Balgruuf the Greater in an attempt to impress him. However, she can't seem to find an opportunity to deliver it. She would like for the sword to be delivered to her father, Proventus Avenicci, the steward of Dragonsreach in Whiterun. Delivering the Sword[edit] Proventus is generally found in the main chamber of Dragonsreach, beside the throne. Deliver the sword to him, telling him that it is from his daughter. He will remark, ""From Adrianne? Ah, this must be that weapon for the Jarl. Poor girl, so eager to prove herself. I'll present it to Balgruuf when his mood is... agreeable.""

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Grimsever%27s_Return","Speak to Mjoll the Lioness in Riften. Find Grimsever in the Dwemer ruins of Mzinchaleft. Return to Mjoll.","Mjoll the Lioness[edit] Mjoll the Lioness lives in Riften where she spends her time speaking out against the Thieves Guild and talking to her faithful follower Aerin about the evils in the world. Acting on her convictions, she has taken on the responsibility of patrolling the town, which she does every day; from 9am she can be found in the Market, at noon she will be inside The Bee and Barb, and from 6pm she patrols the streets of Riften until midnight. Once you reach level 14, however, Mjoll will have more on her mind than just the Thieves Guild. In her younger days, she traveled and adventured all over Tamriel but lost her favorite blade Grimsever when she ventured into the ancient Dwemer ruin of Mzinchaleft. The dangers of the ruin nearly took her life as well, so she retired from adventuring and settled down in Riften. She admits that she feels defenseless without her blade and has a hard time finding a replacement. You can then offer to help her and, while she will refer to it as a 'fool's errand', she will also let you undertake the task, adding a map marker for Mzinchaleft. Mzinchaleft[edit] Mzinchaleft Mzinchaleft is a large Dwemer ruin located in the snowy tundra east of Morthal, northwest of the Hall of the Vigilant. Bandits now inhabit the first zones of the ruin and you will encounter up to six of them guarding the entrance. Fight them, locate the door and prepare for a very long dungeon crawl. Once inside, head down the first two slopes and fight the two bandits residing near the campfire. Proceed through the tunnels until you reach a room with two bandits and a cauldron. Dispose of them and claim some minor loot from the chest. At the intersection, kill the bandit and claim Maluril's Room Key from his body, then use it to unlock the gate. During the Dark Brotherhood quest Kill Maluril, the quarters behind the door will be occupied by Maluril but, during this quest you will find them empty. Read through the Speech skill book A Dance in Fire, v7 then backtrack to the intersection and proceed in a southern direction. In the next chamber you will witness two Dwarven spheres dispose of some bandits before coming after you. Fight them all and keep heading south, following the path as it twists and turns, and disposing of the various automatons along the way. Before long, you will reach an area with a handle and two gates, and several more handles behind the gates. Pull the only available handle and the gate to the east will open. Pull the new handle and the gate to the south will open. Pull the new handle and backtrack to the previous handle and pull it again. Go into a newly opened chamber to the south and pull the handle. Head south yet again and pull the handle, then backtrack to the previous handle and pull it again. Return to the very first handle and pull it. This opens the two gates to the southeast, giving you access to a valve. You'll find an unlocked chest and a master-locked chest in the room with the valve. Activate the valve and the path will now be clear and provide access to the next zone, Mzinchaleft Depths. The Depths[edit] When the elevator brings you down into the Mzinchaleft Depths, the first thing you will notice is a dead Falmer and the recognizable sound of a chaurus on the other side of the locked door. The door hides a very large multi-leveled chamber filled with Falmer enemies and plenty of secret areas, so make sure to raid every corner before leaving through the door to the east. Two Falmer enemies wait in the next chamber, so dispose of them and proceed forward, into a tunnel-like system with more Falmer. Watch out for a tripwire triggering a claw trap as you enter the next room and fight even more Falmer and a chaurus. The tents contain minor loot and a dead bandit. Find the tunnel to the north and open a gate to another huge chamber with a fountain in the middle. Fight the inevitable Falmer enemies and head up the bridge to the north. At the top, fight another Falmer and locate the button and activate it. This will open the path in the southwestern part of the chamber. More Falmer wait on the other side, including a boss, so finish them off and head up the stairs to the north and the entrance to the third and final zone, Mzinchaleft Gatehouse. Grimsever[edit] In the Gatehouse, you will only have to go around the corner before you will encounter the Dwarven Centurion that nearly killed Mjoll the Lioness back in the day. It will attack right away and will be accompanied by a Dwarven Sphere. After the battle, locate Grimsever, which is lying on a table. Find the boss-leveled chest behind bars to the north and pull the nearby handle to gain access. Lastly, if you have the attunement sphere, you can gain access to Blackreach from here. When all is said and done, open the western door and activate the handle to be brought back outside, emerging from an alternate entrance west of the main entrance. Back in Riften you will find Mjoll patrolling as usual. When you hand her the blade, she will be overly impressed: ""Astonishing. To think you actually were able to reach it and yet return to tell the tale. Rarely in my travels have I encountered those who possess skills equal to your own. I see I still have much to learn. If you'd permit me, I'd be honored to accompany you in your travels for a time."" Alternatively, if you told her of your hopes to join the Thieves Guild, she will instead say: ""When you told me of your intent to join the Thieves Guild, I honestly didn't think we'd have much to speak about ever again. Yet here you are with my weapon that you could have easily sold or kept for yourself. Forgive me for my hasty opinion of you, I see that I was wrong and that there's much I can learn from you. If you'd permit me, I'd be honored to accompany you in your travels for a time."" Either way, she will then be available as a follower and a potential candidate for marriage."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Grin_and_Bear_It","Talk to Temba Wide-Arm. Acquire ten bear pelts. Return to Temba Wide-Arm.","Damn Bears[edit] Temba Wide-Arm really does not like bears. She is a Nord woman who has sunk all of her money into a mill in Ivarstead. Even in passing you will hear her complaining to anyone within earshot how the bears are running her business into the ground. If you stop to chat she will explain that bears are ruining the trees by scratching up the trunks, rendering them useless as lumber. She is sorely in need of help with the bear problem and offers payment if you bring her ten bear pelts, thus thinning out the bear population. Filling the Order[edit] Temba will accept any combination of bear pelts, cave bear pelts, or snow bear pelts; it doesn't matter to her as long as they are ursidae. There are two bear dens in the vicinity of Ivarstead: Honeystrand Cave to the south past the river, and Pinepeak Cavern to the north near the steps leading up to High Hrothgar. There are also a number of bear pelts in Broken Oar Grotto, a cave north of Solitude. Giants frequently carry bear pelts, and you can also buy bear pelts from general goods merchants, Khajiit caravans, and hunters in the wild. Once you bring the ten pelts to her she will be surprised that you came through for her and will reward you with a random leveled enchanted war axe."

Speak to the survivor to receive leveled gold and the key to your new home.","Player as a Non-Vampire[edit] The guests await When you arrive at the manor, a number of guests are milling around the front door listening to a bard. Just inside, another reveler is drinking and dancing. Proceed down the hallway to the waiter. No matter what you say, the outcome will be the same; with him handing you a dinner menu (Version 1) and directing you and the other guests to your seats. Sit down at the table, in a place of honor across from the door. Once you sit down, read the note on your plate named Please Read Aloud to gain some insight into this mysterious dinner party and proceed with the quest. After you read the last page of the letter, the waiter will approach Galtius across from you and bite him from behind, killing him. As the other guests rise from their seats in a panic, the bard in the room, the waiter, and two gargoyles will attack. Deal with them, and be careful of the waiter: his lightning attacks are strong enough to one-shot lower-level players. Resist magic gear and followers might help. Once all the vampires and their stone minions are dead, speak with the ""survivor."" Some of the other guests may have survived your battle but the one to speak with is the Orc Durian, who is revealed to be a member of the Dawnguard: The vampires are all dead. And the will says the house belongs to me. ""Very good. But you've created a debt between us. Here. Take this. We are even now."" He will then hand you a leveled amount of gold and a key, and you will become the official owner of the manor. This completes the quest. The doors along the entry hallway will open and you can begin using your new base. If there are any surviving guests besides Durian, they will return to sit at the dinner table amidst the carnage. Once you leave and reenter the cave, all of the bodies and debris will be cleaned up (including the vampiric bard near the entrance, which was presumably dispatched by Durian on your way into dinner), any surviving guests will have left, and the dinner table will be cleared out of the trophy room to allow your unimpeded access. Player as a Vampire[edit] If the player is a vampire, things play out a little differently. When you arrive at the manor, pass through the guests and speak to the waiter at the end of the hall. After choosing one of four options, the waiter will give a generic response and hand you the dinner menu (Version 2). He will then turn and lead you to the banquet table. Once there, sit and read through the feast note Please Read Aloud. After doing so you are instructed to begin the feast, by drinking the blood of the already enthralled Parven. At that point, the waiter will approach Galtius and bite him from behind, killing him. After Galtius's death Parven will also terminate and the Dawnguard will enter the building, initiating battle. After disposing of the Dawnguard and the remaining guests, speak to the waiter once more. The Dawnguard and the nobles are dead. It would seem so. The note seemed to imply the last survivor would get the house. I'm so glad you succeeded. Here. Please take this for your trouble. At this point the waiter will give you the key to the manor and some leveled gold, completing the quest. Three more dialogue options are given; all will end the conversation. The doors along the entry hallway are now open for use, and when you leave and reenter the cavern all of the destruction from your fight will be cleared away."

Travel to Volunruud to collect your reward. Return to Nazir at the Dawnstar Sanctuary.","Time to Settle the Score[edit] Despite the devastation wrought on the Dark Brotherhood, the Night Mother wants you to finish your contract and kill the Emperor, Titus Mede II. The real Emperor's whereabouts are unknown, so travel to Whiterun and find Amaund Motierre in his room at The Bannered Mare. Amaund will reveal that the true Emperor is on board his ship, The Katariah, near Solitude's docks. Amaund will also inform you that Commander Maro is outside the East Empire Company Warehouse at the docks, should you wish to exact revenge. Go to the East Empire Company Warehouse, near Solitude. Commander Maro will be standing on the dock. If you approach him, he will be startled by your appearance and proceed to attack. This will allow you to kill him without incurring a bounty, and the nearby guards may even assist you if you allow Maro to make the first strike. Alternatively, kill Maro from a distance or sneak up to him and kill him stealthily. It's worth noting that Maro has his own faction, so any bounty you incur when attacking him will be lost on his death. You can, if you wish, ignore Maro completely and move on to the next objective. Bringing Down an Empire[edit] The Katariah The next target is the true Emperor, aboard his ship The Katariah, moored out to the north of the city in a channel called the Solitude Inlet. Security has been relaxed somewhat, as the Penitus Oculatus believes that the Dark Brotherhood has been completely eradicated. Nonetheless, many bodyguards are still present on the ship. Access the ship underwater by using the anchor to climb aboard. On board the ship are sailors and Penitus Oculatus Agents, both of which are relatively weak and easy to defeat. You can fight your way through the ship or simply sneak through, as few guards will be patrolling the hallways and can all be picked off quite easily, though some will attack with both sword and shock spells. You will not earn a bounty for killing or being seen by anyone on board. You can also traverse the upper deck, which contains many guards. A unique sword, Windshear, can be found at the very end of the bowsprit - the slanted mast at the ship's bow. King, a Two-handed skill book, can be found next to the throne, on the highest part of the ship's deck. Captain Avidius and Lieutenant Salvarus are also present on the ship, both in their individual private quarters, and are somewhat tougher than the other guards. They both carry a Katariah Master Key, which will open all doors on the ship, including the Emperor's Quarters. There is another master key on a hook in the captain's quarters, just to the side of the door. An Honorable Man[edit] Enter the Emperor's Quarters. Whether you came in sneaking or not, the Emperor will greet you straight away, as he has been expecting you. He will acknowledge that it is his destiny to die by your hand, and will not fight you. He asks, however, for you to listen for a moment before killing him. You can, if you want, kill the Emperor instantly, or hear what he has to say. The Emperor simply asks that you consider killing the person who masterminded his assassination, as he feels that his intentions could be malevolent. After slaying the Emperor and finally completing this arduous contract, take a look around his quarters. There are some rare books lying about and some very expensive gems and jewelry behind a locked door, which can be opened with the key the Emperor holds. The unique Gilded Wristguards and an extra set of the Emperor's Robes are also to be found. There is even a book on the third era, which tells about Empress Katariah, after whom the ship was named. A Hard-Earned Reward[edit] Use the Emperor's key to exit the ship and return to Whiterun to speak to Amaund. He will reveal that the money for the contract is in a dead drop inside the cavern where you first met, in Volunruud. After informing Amaund of the Emperor's death, you may speak to him again to say that you have unfinished business with him, but he does not comprehend what you mean by your cryptic words and will not attack you. You may kill him if you wish to fulfill the Emperor's last wish. If you do, a surprised Amaund's last words will be, ""But... we had a deal..."" Amaund's corpse can be looted for a significant amount of gems. However, if you do not wish to kill Amaund, the gems may be easily pickpocketed from him. Go to Volunruud and the chamber where you first met Amaund. Inside, you will find a normal chest and an urn containing 20,000 gold. Return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary and speak to Nazir about the gold, and he will ask how much money you received. You can choose to lie to him, but you keep the entire reward regardless of the option you choose. Nazir will point out that Delvin Mallory of the Thieves Guild could assist in using the gold to restore the sanctuary. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked at the end of this quest: Hail Sithis! (30 points/Silver)"

Give the items to Halbarn and collect your reward.","After the Attack[edit] Once the quest Retaking Thirsk has been completed, the Nord warriors of Thirsk move back into Thirsk Mead Hall. However, during their lengthy exile in Bujold's Retreat, the invading Rieklings turned the hall upside down, with much cleanup to be done. The blacksmith of the hall, Halbarn Iron-Fur, found his forge filled with slop and had to request assistance from Elmus to clean it up. Despite the terrible smell coming from the flames, he is still able to do some work, although he has more problems: ""Cleaning out the forge was the easy part. But those blasted rieklings made off with most of my materials. And I can't forge air. You tend to wander around, don't you? If you come across any stalhrim or ebony in your travels, bring them back to old Halbarn. Help each other out."" This starts the quest and adds an objective to your journal. You will have to gather ten samples of stalhrim and fifteen ebony ingots for Halbarn. Note that you will have to keep count yourself, as the quest will not update. Stalhrim[edit] The Stalhrim Source Stalhrim can only be found on Solstheim, in stalhrim deposits. They can only be mined using an ancient Nordic pickaxe, the reward for completing the quest An Axe To Find. Alternatively, you can buy one from Baldor Iron-Shaper in Skaal Village. Baldor is also the only merchant that will sell you stalhrim, although he never sells more than four (75% chance each), so you will need to find some stalhrim deposits as well. The very best source for collecting stalhrim is the Stalhrim Source, a landmark in northwestern Solstheim. If you have completed the quest A New Source of Stalhrim, the deposit will be marked on your map. It is located south of Northshore Landing and east of Bristleback Cave and Broken Tusk Mine. With the ancient Nordic pickaxe in hand, take the trip to the Stalhrim Source, and start mining. You can gather thirty pieces of stalhrim there. For other sources, see this article. Ebony Ingots[edit] Raven Rock Mine With only seven fixed ebony ingots in the entire game, you will be forced to do some mining and smelting to retrieve the requested amount. Two ebony ores are used to smelt one ebony ingot, meaning you will need at least thirty ebony ores. If you are level 27 or above, there is a chance that blacksmiths and general goods merchants will sell you ores and/or ingots, and an additional chance of looting ores from ash spawn, but mining is probably the easiest method to achieve your goal. There are two options available. You can travel back to Skyrim and find the biggest source of ebony ore in the game, namely Gloombound Mine in the Orc stronghold of Narzulbur. With sixteen ore veins, the mine will net you 48 ebony ores, for a total of 24 ingots, which is more than enough to satisfy Halbarn. However, it is also possible to avoid the trip to Skyrim and stay on Solstheim. If you have completed the quest The Final Descent, thus helping the townsfolk of Raven Rock, the local Raven Rock Mine will be reopened and new ore veins discovered. This makes the mine the second best source for ebony ore in the game, with a total of nine ore veins, and after some smelting, thirteen ebony ingots. You can also travel to Northshore Landing and find the ebony ore vein a few feet south of the abandoned shack where Old Salty resides, and travel to the landmark Horker Island where the named horker, Lord Tusk, lives. Head to the northeastern shore of the island, where a boat has sunken completely, head west up the beach until you reach the ebony vein next to the cliff wall. Mine your ore and smelt it until you have the fifteen ebony ingots for Halbarn. The Reward[edit] When you have gathered all the items, return to Thirsk Mead Hall and Halbarn. Hand him the materials and he will hand you a medium amount of leveled gold and be quite happy: ""Just in time, too. Kuvar was starting to give me some grief about his new armor. This will do the trick nicely. You come back if you ever want some fancier armor yourself, now."""
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hard_Answers","Speak to Enthir at The Frozen Hearth or Hall of Attainment. Speak to Calcelmo in Understone Keep. Enter the Dwemer Museum. Copy the Falmer Translation Guide. Bring the copy of the Guide to Enthir. Speak to Karliah in The Frozen Hearth.","First go speak with Enthir at The Frozen Hearth in Winterhold. After speaking with Enthir, you'll be directed to the wizard Calcelmo at Understone Keep in Markarth. Note: There is a bug that prevents you from talking to Enthir if you have started but not completed the quests The Staff of Magnus or The Eye of Magnus, as Enthir believes Winterhold to be in danger and will continually repeat ""This is going to be terrible for business."" Calcelmo, the Wizard[edit] You can find Calcelmo overseeing the excavation site in Understone Keep. He's not happy to be disturbed and no matter what you choose to do, will not be interested in helping you translate the journal—at best, he will grant you access to his museum. You have several options on how to proceed: You can go straight to the museum and pick the lock. Using this method causes the guards in the museum to be hostile, and as they are city guards you will incur a bounty if you kill them. You can simply steal his key, which should be right next to him on the table. This option will cause the guards to be hostile, unless you are successfully hidden. If you ask to visit the archaeological site, you will be asked to kill Nimhe (a giant frostbite spider). After you have done this task you will be given the key to the museum, and can walk past the city guards without sneaking. Solving Calcelmo's love problems during The Book of Love will add additional dialogue where he will hand over the key to the museum, and allow you passage (the guard at the door will still tell you you can't enter, but the guards in the museum won't bother you). If you can pass a hard Speech check, you can persuade him to give you the key to the museum. Option  Dialogue  Reaction   Even after slaying your troublesome spider? I've already provided you a key to the museum. You should consider it an honor. Few are allowed to browse my collection. I'm sorry, but that's as far as my generosity extends. No progress   Even after everything I did for you and Faleen? Well, I'm not blind to the fact that you've been instrumental in improving my affairs of the heart. If you wish, you may enter my tower to view the museum section, but I'm afraid the laboratories are still off limits. That's the best I can offer. No progress   But I'm a great admirer of your work. (Persuade) Passed: What kind of a mentor would I be if I denied a potential student a glimpse at his master's ingenuity! Here, this key will provide access to my museum. Feel free to browse for as long as you wish. However, I must insist that my laboratory remains strictly off limits.Failed: While I appreciate the sentiment, I still have to decline. Being an admirer, I'm sure you can appreciate the need to keep my research a secret. Passed: Get the keyFailed: Nothing   What will it cost to change your mind? (Bribe) Failed: I'm not certain how many scholars you're accustomed to dealing with, but I can assure you that personal wealth is our lowest priority. Failed: Nothing   Grant me access or you'll regret it. (Intimidate) Failed: Do you realize that at a snap of my fingers I can bring the entire Markarth city guard to my defense? You best rethink this course of action or you may find yourself on the executioner's block. Failed: Nothing   Forget it. Maybe I'll come back later. Very well. Perhaps when my research is complete, I'll feel more comfortable discussing my findings with you. Nothing Enter the Museum[edit] Whatever you chose to do, it's clear you're going to have to break into Calcelmo's laboratory in order to retrieve the Falmer Translation Guide, so head for the Dwemer Museum. There are a lot of random Dwemer artifacts and books in the museum, but most notably, there is a gate on the south side protecting a room containing an Unusual Gem—the gem is located on a table to your right as you enter the first room on the left. Make your way to the far end of the museum to find the entrance to Calcelmo's Laboratory. As you enter the lab, you can find the Spider Control Rod in the room to the left, which you can use to help clear out the guards ahead (note that the rod only works in the lab). There are two types of guards in the museum and laboratory: Markarth City guards and Calcelmo's personal guards. The city guards here will not be hostile (provided you didn't pick the Museum lock), but Calcelmo's personal guards in the lab will confront you if they spot you, no matter what (though they will not give you a bounty if they are harmed). It's possible to sneak past all the guards in the lab without any combat, but you can also employ the various traps around the lab to dispatch them quickly. Whatever you choose, make your way to the end of the laboratory. As you make your way through, beware the hall with the poison gas; your health will drain rapidly until you reach the other side, and it is not possible to prevent the damage with poison resistances, even with items such as Hevnoraak. Putting 40 pounds of weight (either the body of a dead guard or a heavy item such as Dwarven armor) on the pressure plate at either end of the hall will depress the plate and stop the gas from spreading, allowing you to comfortably loot the corpses. You can also Become Ethereal and not suffer the poison for the duration of the shout (though be warned, this may alert nearby guards). The poison gas hall can be avoided entirely by taking a different higher route eastwards. At the end of the lab, you'll find Aicantar's study, where Calcelmo's nephew is busy with his research. Activating the trap here will send Aicantar into a panic and he and his guards will make a run for it (or you can just sneak past him). Near the exit, you can find the Dwemer Puzzle Cube for The Litany of Larceny quest. Exit out onto the Wizard's Balcony and head up the stairs to the right into Calcelmo's Tower. In the tower, follow the hall to the left to find a room with a desk. Beyond the room is the Falmer Translation Guide, which turns out to be a massive stone tablet. There's no way you're taking the whole thing back to Enthir, so grab a piece of charcoal and paper from the previous room and use them to create a rubbing of the tablet. Return to Enthir[edit] After you copy the text, two Wizards' Guards, Captain Aquilius, and Aicantar will enter the tower to hunt you down. You may fight them if you wish, but you can also simply sneak past them after they split up. Distracting the remaining guard with an arrow is a good way to aid a stealthy approach. For the quickest escape, look towards the exit from the tablet and you'll notice a small ledge on either side of the wall over the door. Move from behind the tablet onto the platform to your left, then jump onto the little ""chimney"" at the end of the platform. From there, you can jump onto the small ledge and proceed directly to the door. Once outside, a waypoint will indicate your exit route: simply hug the right wall of the balcony to find a gap leading to a small cliffside path, terminating at a waterfall. Carefully jump into the pool at the base of the waterfall to complete your escape. It's also possible to ""climb"" down from the balcony by looking left and down when you reach the waterfall—there will be a path of sorts where you can make very small drops to multiple rocks (you can use Become Ethereal to avoid damage with either method). Alternatively, you can retrace your steps back through the museum and exit the keep the same way you came in. Once you've escaped, return to Winterhold, where Karliah and Enthir are waiting in the cellar of the Frozen Hearth. Enthir will use the rubbing of Calcelmo's tablet to translate Gallus's journal, confirming that Mercer used the Guild's funds and desecrated the Twilight Sepulcher, the secret shrine to Nocturnal that the Nightingales are sworn to protect. Karliah will also give you the Nightingale Blade as a token of appreciation, and ask that you meet her at the Ragged Flagon. After talking with Enthir and Karliah, the quest ends and The Pursuit begins. Note: Completing this quest will lock the back door from Riften's graveyard to The Ragged Flagon - Cistern until later in the next quest."

Return to Elynea and plant the taproots in the tower of Tel Mithryn. Receive your reward from Elynea.","Elynea Mothren[edit] The founder of Tel Mithryn, the eccentric and bossy Neloth is rumored to be a nightmare to work for. When you visit the apothecary you will find an unhappy proprietor, Elynea Mothren, wandering around badmouthing Neloth: ""That ash eating wizard is always on me about his tower. It's not my damn fault the thing withered overnight."" She then explains the problem. Apparently, something went wrong inside the tower and Neloth wants it fixed right away and will have no qualms firing Elenya if that can speed things up. When asked what she needs she will say: ""Three taproots soaked in the headwaters of the Harstrad river. I'm an old woman. I can't possibly make that trip. It's way too dangerous. If you get some taproots, I'll pay you to dip them in the headwaters and bring them to me."" Hunting for Taproot[edit] A map marker for the Headwaters of Harstrad will be added once you talk to Elynea, but two taproots can be acquired there, so you only need one. On Solstheim, taproots can be found in the following locations: Elynea herself may have some (15% chance). Two samples are found near the Alchemy Lab inside Severin Manor in Raven Rock. There are three samples inside Ienth Farm in Raven Rock. On an unmarked island north of Frossel you will find three spriggans, all of them carrying taproot. Once you have at least one taproot, travel to the headwaters, which are hidden between Benkongerike and the Wind Stone. Note: A bug fix in the Unofficial Skyrim Patch allows spriggans to have either taproots or spriggan sap, so neither the headwaters nor the unmarked island are guaranteed locations of taproot. Headwaters of Harstrad[edit] A Spriggan Matron in Harstrad Cave The Headwaters of Harstrad is a small landmark and consists of a waterfall that empties into a small lake. There will be a spriggan of some type here, either alive and on the shore near the lake, or dead and floating around in the lake. Kill the spriggan if needed, claim the taproot from the body, then dive headfirst into the waterfall and enter the hidden cave Harstrad Cave. Once inside, you will immediately be attacked by another spriggan, so dispose of it and claim the taproot if you need it. After the battle, the Headwaters will activate so follow the map marker and soak three taproots in the water. Before you leave, make sure to search the boss-leveled chest for some extra goodies, then return to Tel Mithryn. Healing a House[edit] The new room in Tel Mithryn Back in the apothecary, Elynea Mothren will be quite happy when you tell her the mission is accomplished. Hand her the three soaked taproots and she will, surprisingly, keep two samples for herself, saying: ""I'll just keep two of them for myself. No need for Neloth to know. Take that last taproot and plant it into the wall of the withered house."" Head over to the tower where Neloth will wander around and complain as always. Find the withered area in the northwestern part of the laboratory and plant the taproot in it. Return to Elynea Mothren for a reaction and a small reward: ""Good. Now maybe Neloth will get off my back about it. I suppose you think you should get paid for helping an old woman. Here. Take these. I'll sell you more if you come back later."" She will then hand you two leveled potions of well-being. You are also free to take most of the ingredients displayed in her shop for free. Lastly, pay a visit to the tower where Neloth has built an entire new room, a testing area for spriggans, complete with two trapped spriggans in cages. Back in the apothecary, Elynea will also have a new job for you.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Heart_of_Crimson","Wait for a courier to deliver the Letter from Tyra Blood-Fire. Speak with the beggar at Windhelm docks. Confront Tyra at the shrine of Talos southwest of Windhelm.","Once you've reached level 32, head to a settlement and a courier will deliver the Letter from Tyra Blood-Fire. It is addressed to you personally, from a notorious leader of a bandit gang named Tyra Blood-Fire. Her gang has disbanded, and she now seeks the judgment of the Divines to atone for her past crimes. She believes that facing you in combat is the only way to receive this divine judgment, but first you must prove your character to her. The letter instructs you to go to the docks in Windhelm and give alms to a local beggar. He sits on a mat down the end of the docks, near the East Empire Company offices. You will have the option to give him 1 gold, 100 gold, some wine, some bread, or to give him nothing and pray for his prosperity. Your choice is irrelevant, as you will be given the opportunity to face Tyra no matter which option you choose. With this done, you will be directed to a shrine of Talos southwest of Windhelm, at the top of a small mountain overlooking the bridge next to the stables (map). Tyra is praying there, and as promised she will be hostile upon your approach. She is a dangerous enemy, as she possesses a full set of Ebony Plate Armor bearing powerful enchantments and dual wields two ebony swords in combat. Defeat her and loot her corpse for the valuable enchanted set of armor; with this quest completed, you will begin to find Ebony Plate items as random loot throughout Skyrim. You can also loot her for a single ruby, a copy of The Crimson Dirks, v1 explaining her origins, and a letter titled To (Player). The contents of this final letter is dependent on the choice you made when speaking with the beggar.  The letter received has 5 different middle parts. Prayer for the Beggar - ""You chose to pray for the beggar, putting your faith in the Divines. After all, maybe it isn't food or water people need, but hope in something greater than themselves. But the world is not a place where hope alone will save you. My advice to you is to seize your destiny. Don't wait for an idle god. Then you'll be a worthy judge and executioner for your enemies, just as you were for me."" Give 1 gold - ""You gave the beggar a single septim. I like the amount. you did what you could without placing a burden on yourself. and yet, on its own a single piece does nothing for him. It's only when the entire town does their part, each one placing a septim, that the beggar has enough to eat. So my advice to you is to remember the value of company. Whether you're a bandit or a hero, no one can do it alone. You have to work together, one gold piece at a time, to do what needs to be done."" Give 100 Gold - ""You gave the beggar a full purse of gold. You're someone who goes above and beyond, putting the lives of others above your own. But not even a thousand septims can save the life of every man, woman, and child. So my advice to you is to not fall victim to your kindness. There are people like me who will take advantage of it. And there are times when you'll have to make a hard decision for the greater again. Save who you can, but do what you must."" Give Bread - ""You gave the beggar bread, a choice I agree with. Gold can be wasted. Wine can be a poison. But a meal can never be squandered. Perhaps if I had been given a similar gift, my life would have been different. As such, I deem you a worthy judge. Hopefully you will be a swift executioner. Either way, I thank you."" Give Wine - ""You gave the beggar wine. It'll help him forget his troubles; give him a reprieve. But such gifts can quickly sour. Come morning, the beggar may regret your choice, or worse yet, he might repeat it. So my advice to you is to view every action in its entirety. Only then can you make your choices with clear eyes."""

Help the priestesses of Dibella find a new Sybil. Travel to Karthwasten and learn the location of Fjotra. (Optional) Escort Enmon to Broken Tower Redoubt. Rescue Fjotra from the Forsworn. Escort Fjotra back to the Temple of Dibella.","The Temple of Dibella[edit] The temple located in Markarth is dedicated to Dibella, the goddess of love, beauty, and artistry. It is maintained by several priestesses and Hamal. Upon entering the temple, you will find the priestess Senna, who will inform you that: ""The sisters are communing with Dibella. They can't be disturbed. You'll have to come back another time."" In order to access the Inner Sanctum, you can either try to pick the expert-lock, or steal the key from Senna. Note that if you choose to pick the lock and do not accept the deal from the Priestess, you'll have to do it twice—once to get into the Sanctum, and once to get out. Communing with DibellaExalted Protocol of the Dibellan SybilIf you are caught by one of the priestesses, they will exclaim: ""What are you doing in here? Stay where you are. The mother will deal with you."" If you ask who their ""mother"" is, they will direct you to speak with Hamal. She will then initiate conversation by saying: ""And just what do you think you're doing?"" If you tell her that you were curious about the temple, she will tell you: ""Unfortunately for you, we don't allow men/the uninitiated into the inner sanctum."" Hamal will then continue: ""You have committed a breach, and must pay the penalty."" Asking what the penalty is, she will elaborate: ""Normally, a quick death/period of servitude. Luckily for you, there are more pressing matters. We could make an example of you, but perhaps you could be put to better use."" Also asking what use that would be, she will explain: ""The ceremony you so rudely interrupted was the Exalted Protocol of the Dibellan Sybil. I don't expect you to know what that means. Suffice to say that our Sybil was recently lost to us.	Through the Protocol, we have seen the home of the next Sybil, to the north, in a small village pressed against the stone. If you can travel there, and retrieve our young Sybil, your transgression will be forgiven.""    The Statue of DibellaStealing the Statue of DibellaIf you chose to try to steal the statue for Degaine, and get caught by one of the priestesses, she will inform Hamal. At this point, if you threaten them, the priestess will say: ""If that's how you choose to end your life, so be it."" If you allow yourself to speak with Hamal, you can tell her that you only came here for the statue. She will then reply with: ""So be it. We gave you a choice."" Both responses result in the priestesses becoming hostile and attacking you. Since none of them are essential (with the exception of Senna), they can die as a result, causing you to be unable to complete The Heart of Dibella quest. Once you have retrieved the statue, you can turn it over to Degaine who will hastily say: ""Give it to me quickly, before they see us together. You've riled up the priestesses, and the guards don't take kindly to that. Here's your share. Nicely done."" He then gives you 150 gold in exchange for the statue. However, if you managed to steal the statue unnoticed, you may return to the temple and purposely get noticed in order to start the quest The Heart of Dibella. Karthwasten[edit] A distraught Enmon working at the smelter If you choose to help the priestesses find the new Sybil, you are directed to visit Karthwasten and locate the young girl's father, Enmon, who may be found working in the mine or at the smelter. If you speak to any of the local residents, they will all direct you to speak to him as well. If you tell him that you are looking for his daughter, he will retort: ""Damn it, man/woman, are you trying to taunt us?"" Asking him what he meant, he will explain: ""Our daughter, Fjotra, was taken from here. The Forsworn descended and... they didn't touch anything else. Just our little girl."" Also asking where they took her, he will continue: ""It was the Forsworn from Broken Tower. Never been much trouble before. What's it to you?"" You can now respond to him in two different ways: If you tell Enmon that you just want his daughter to be safe, he will remark: ""That's... that's good of you. If you were to save her, I would be very grateful. I don't think there's anything I could give you, though..."" However, if you tell Enmon that Fjotra is the new Sybil of Dibella, he will say: ""She... really? That's... I wouldn't have dreamed. Of course, we need her in Markarth, then. I'll come with you."" If you agree that he should travel with you, he will thank you and accompany you to Broken Tower Redoubt. Note that if you take him along with you, he is a non-essential NPC, and can die. You can also tell him that he should stay, and he will reply with urgency: ""You're... probably right. Just hurry, please. Who knows what those things are doing to her."" You are now directed to travel to the Broken Tower Redoubt and rescue Fjotra from the Forsworn holding her captive. Touched by the Gods[edit] A Forsworn Briarheart guarding Fjotra's cell Making your way through the Broken Tower Redoubt, you can find Fjotra in her cell, guarded by a Forsworn Briarheart. After you have defeated the Briarheart and freed her, she will ask: ""Are you one of them? Please don't hurt me."" When you tell her that you are to bring her to the Temple in Markarth, she will exclaim: ""Then it is true what they said? I am touched by the gods?"" Her suspicions confirmed, Fjotra will then accept her title as the new Sybil of Dibella: ""I've heard stories about the wonders of the great Temple in Markarth. But I never dreamed that I would even get to see it. I am honored to be called for this duty. Please, lead on."" A final farewell You must now return Fjotra to the Temple to become the new Sybil of Dibella, but you also can take a detour to Karthwasten, so Fjotra can say goodbye to her parents, Enmon and Mena, who will give her a very heart-warming farewell: Enmon: ""Fjotra!"" Fjotra: ""Father!"" Enmon: ""Fjotra, dear. Did they hurt you?"" Fjotra: ""Of course not. My spirit remains strong."" Enmon: ""My little girl. Always strong. Do you know where you have to go?"" Fjotra: ""I'm to go to the temple in Markarth. I... I'll have to leave you and mother."" Enmon: ""It's our honor to have you there. This man/woman is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?"" Fjotra: ""Of course."" Afterwards, Enmon will approach and thank you: ""Thank you for getting her back from the Forsworn. Dibella was smart to have sent you."" You can now return to Hamal in the Temple of Dibella in Markarth to complete the quest. A New Sybil[edit] A new Sybil in the Temple of Dibella Upon arriving back at the temple, Hamal will be grateful for the safe return of Fjotra: ""You... you found her? I can't believe it. Let the girl come with me and we can begin her preparation. I will send word to her family that she is in good hands. You've truly earned the Blessing of Dibella, child. Prostrate yourself before her altar, and she will bestow her gift."" You are now directed to kneel before and then drink the blessed water, which will bestow the Agent of Dibella passive ability. This grants an additional 10% physical damage against enemies of the opposite sex, and the quest will now be marked as complete."

The hall is just north of Bilegulch Mine and southwest of Fort Sungard. The climb is quite steep if approaching directly from the north, so it's advisable to approach from the Sungard side (climb the slope to the east, passing the Bilegulch Dragon Mound as you go, and circle around from the rear of the house to reach the front). Once you arrive at the property, you will meet a rather unassuming Nord woman called Eydvina Shield-Hearth sweeping the stables. She is responsible for the challenge you have received, and will gear up for battle after a brief conversation. Kill her to claim the key to the property. On her corpse you will also find a note explaining her motivation for seeking a warrior's death in order to enter Sovngarde. Head inside the house to complete the quest and investigate your new player home."

Speak with Aphia Velothi and give her two hours to translate the letter. Convince four people in Raven Rock to take a copy of the letter or show it to the Reclamation Priest in the Temple.","A Task for the Goddess[edit] This quest is offered as part of the Ghosts of the Tribunal quest if you choose to disguise yourself as Hand Kenro Hlan before entering Ashfall's Tear. Doing so will allow you to speak with the normally hostile Matriarch Drevlan. Offer to serve the Goddess Almalexia, and Drevlan will give you this quest along with Buyer Beware and Careless Curation. These quests are all optional and can be completed in any order, although you must do them if you intend to remain aligned with the Tribunal Temple. For this quest, you will be instructed to speak with Priest Drureth. He can be found in one of the side rooms within the temple in Ashfall's Tear. He will hand you a transcribed Propaganda Letter which will need to be translated from the original Daedric text before it can be distributed. Information Campaign[edit] The Raven Rock Temple would be very interested in knowing about this letter Return to Raven Rock with the untranslated letter and speak with Aphia Velothi. She is a former Temple priestess and will agree to secretly translate the text of the letter. If you have not yet encountered Aphia, she can initially be found just inside the entrance to Raven Rock Mine. It will take her two hours to translate the document. With the translated letters in hand, you will be presented with two options on how to progress the quest: Distribute four copies to the general public. Individuals who will agree to take one include: Cindiri Arano, Glover Mallory, Milore Ienth, Fethis Alor, Crescius Caerellius, Geldis Sadri, Niyya (inside The Retching Netch if she survived Old Friends), Drovas Relvi, Talvas Fathryon, Revus Sarvani, Bujold the Unworthy, Kuvar, Hilund, Elmus and Halbarn Iron-Fur. You will need to persuade, intimidate or bribe them to read the letter or to show the letter to their patrons. Give the letters to the Reclamation Priest within the Raven Rock Temple. He will reward you with a leveled amount of gold. Completing either of these options will complete the quest and will progress your list of tasks for Matriarch Drevlan. When all three tasks are completed, she will give you the quest Ashen Heart. Reward[edit] The outcome of this quest depends on whether you chose to distribute the propaganda or alert the New Temple authorities. If you chose to distribute the material, you will return to Ashfall's Tear to find a number of new occupants. These new converts will have cleaned the temple's living areas, replacing the destroyed furnishings previously found there. In addition to this beautification, the main benefit will be the new blacksmith vendor, who will appear along with a now-functioning forge. If you spoke to the Reclamation Priest instead, the interior of the temple will remain largely abandoned and you will not be able to use the forge. If you chose this option, the priest will appear at Ashfall's Tear in the company of three members of the Redoran Guard at the end of the quest line.[verification needed — when?] They will attempt to kill the heretics within, and you are free to join in if you so choose. The Reclamation Priest will show up at Ashfall's Tear upon return either right after handing him the translated propaganda letters or after heading to Stony Creek Cave to either kill or rescue Curate Melita. If returning after the Careless Curation quest the Reclamation Priest may be found dead in the passage between the Alchemy lab and the Blacksmith chamber. In any case if he's killed the Priest Robes can be looted from his corpse."

Your target would be a Traveling Bard, Traveling Pilgrim, or Visiting Advisor (see Bugs) at a radiant city or town. This can include Raven Rock if Dragonborn is installed. However, as the law is unaware of the danger, you will be treated as a criminal if you're caught. Travel to your destination and identify your target. If you talk to him and expose him as a vampire, he will initially deny it. ""I beg your pardon, sir/ma'am. I don't know what you're getting at, but whatever it is, it's not appreciated.""

Return to Farkas.","Note: it is best to complete this quest as soon as possible after receiving it, because many of the quest targets can possibly die (either through random or scripted events), at which point it becomes impossible to ever complete the quest or take any other jobs for the Companions. Farkas will send you to rough up one of over 400 different NPCs, encompassing nearly every citizen in Skyrim.  The NPC will be located in a hold that you have previously visited, so early in the game you may only be given NPCs living in Whiterun Hold, but later in the game there are many more possible options.  The NPC may live in a city, town, or a remote settlement. Once you have traveled to the target's location, talk to them and select the dialogue option to brawl with them.  It is best to start the brawl in an area with as few other NPCs as possible.  In particular, it is best to have any follower wait in a different room.  You may not use any weapons, magic, or shouts during a brawl (but using spells such as Fear or Oakflesh before the fight is permissible).  If anyone else becomes hostile as a result of your brawling, you should be able to run to a guard and yield, clearing any hostility. If you kill the target, you will still complete the quest.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hitting_the_Books","Speak with Urag gro-Shub. Make your way through Fellglow Keep. (Optional): Free Orthorn. Find the three stolen books. Return the books to the College.","The Arcanaeum[edit] After the discovery of the mysterious Orb in the depths of Saarthal, a puzzled Tolfdir decides to send you back alone to alert Arch-Mage Savos Aren. Aren turns out to be quite uninterested in the whole affair. You will then be given the quest and prompted to go speak to Mirabelle Ervine, who then sends you along to librarian Urag gro-Shub to research the subject. Locate Urag, who can usually be found behind his desk inside the Arcanaeum where he functions as the librarian and keeps a close eye on the College's huge collection of ancient tomes. After warning you about touching any of the books in the library, the old Orc will mention that there may be relevant information in one of three tomes which are no longer in his possession. They were 'borrowed' by an Apprentice named Orthorn who recently, due to a dispute with the College, joined a group of renegade mages in Fellglow Keep. Urag can do nothing for you without the books, and says you'll have to find Orthorn to retrieve the books so the research of the Orb can begin. On your way out the door you may be approached by Faralda who tells you that the Thalmor visitor, Ancano, wants a word with you. If you do not see Faralda, Ancano will actively seek you out and ask you questions about what was found in Saarthal. During this discussion you can choose to provoke him or not, but he will always get the answer he seeks. Proceed out the door and prepare for Fellglow Keep. The Dungeons[edit] Fellglow Keep is a large fort located between Whiterun and Windhelm. When you arrive it becomes clear that the residing mages are far from friendly as you will be attacked by two elemental mages and a flame atronach. Dispose of them and locate the entrance to Fellglow Keep Dungeons. Upon entering, head down the stairs and follow the path as it twists and turns. The second flooded room is guarded by another hostile mage who has been experimenting with frostbite spiders and will send them after you with the words: ""Ah, a test subject! Go, my pets! Attack!"" Fight the spiders and the mage, then proceed southeast and beware of the pressure plate triggering a dart trap along the way. Before long, you will arrive in a room filled with cages containing some very unusual prisoners, specifically leveled vampires. You can use the four handles to release them, or pick their cell locks, and they will cause havoc in the next room before leaving the dungeon peacefully. The next room reveals that several experiments were conducted on vampires as bodies are everywhere. Locate the northeastern tunnel and listen to the sound of wolves howling. In the next room are more cages and another hostile mage, seemingly another experiment chamber. Dispose of the mage and inspect the cages. Apart from the wolves, you will also find the renegade mage Orthorn, seemingly imprisoned by the mages he thought of as friends. Orthorn[edit] Orthorn in action As it turns out, Orthorn was imprisoned as yet another test subject by the mages, despite the fact that he came to Fellglow Keep to help them. You can choose to comfort him by saying Savos Aren sent you to rescue him, or you can simply be honest and say you are there solely for the books. In both cases, Orthorn will offer to help clear out the dungeon and find the missing books, so decide if you want him to tag along. Pull the lever in the middle and he will be released from the cage. He will proceed to explain that the books were taken by someone known as The Caller. If you accept his help you will have to put up with his comments for the rest of a very long trip, although he is a powerful conjurer and wields a lightning bolt spell. If you decline, he will head out of the dungeon peacefully. Regardless of your choice, he is disabled later on and disappears from the game. Unfortunately, the nearby door leading to Fellglow Keep is locked (key required), so you will have to take the long path. Go through the wooden door and make your way through the trashed tunnels. The next chamber has three fire mages training destruction spells on a living vampire in a cage, so be on your guard when they notice you. You can find a copy of The Legend of Red Eagle on the table in the middle of the room. Take the northern path and you will reach the undercroft, which is guarded by necromancers. There is a pedestal with a copy of Spell Tome: Raise Zombie just before the stairs leading to the next zone, Fellglow Keep. Fellglow Keep[edit] There is a small table at the end of the hallway before the stairs that has a coin purse and an easily missed Black Soul Gem behind a book. The first chamber of Fellglow Keep is guarded by a conjurer and an ice mage and has the Conjuration skill book The Doors of Oblivion on a pedestal. Open the eastern door and fight the patrolling necromancer, then proceed through the chambers and fight all the enemies in the room with multiple paths. A locked door (key required) leads outside while the eastern door leads to the sleeping quarters and more enemies. Check all the shelves for rare books, then head up the stairs. The room to the west holds an Unusual Gem so make sure to pick it up. Take the adjacent path and head upstairs to a room filled with shelves and the Destruction skill book A Hypothetical Treachery on a table. Proceed forward and make sure to check behind the closed doors for some extra loot. One of the doors is locked but pick the lock and find a shrine to Julianos and a wealth of ingredients. Open the wooden door to the north and start climbing the tower. Before long you will reach the Fellglow Ritual Chamber and an encounter with the Caller. The Caller[edit] The Caller waiting in the ritual chamber You arrive in the ritual chamber right away and the Caller awaits you, right in the center. She will, however, remain calm and greet you: ""So, you're the one who barged into my home and laid waste to my projects. How nice to meet you."" You will have two dialogue options to choose from; either ask her who she is or ask for the three books. The first option will make her respond, ""Names no longer matter. You may refer to me as The Caller. Now, do you have a reason for making such a mess?"" When you ask her for the books she will be disappointed: ""So you're just one of Aren's lackeys? That's disappointing. You show real promise. You come here, kill my assistants, disrupt my work... You've annoyed me, so I don't think I'll be giving you anything."" At this point it is actually possible to persuade her to let you have the books. Alternatively, if you brought Orthorn along with you, you can negotiate with her for the books. She will then say, ""An arrangement? After you've destroyed so much? Fine. Leave me the elf. You may go with your books."" You have to walk up to the Caller and start a conversation. Agree to her conditions, then pick up the book. If you simply pick up a book without doing this she will attack you. If you didn't bring Orthorn, she will say, ""I'm afraid you don't have anything worth trading."" Dispose of her and claim the three books (two of the books are behind the Caller on pedestals; lifting either will spawn a Flame or Frost Atronach, depending on your level). If Orthorn is still there, you can have a brief conversation with him which he ends with: ""You'll be going back to the College, then? I, uhh... I think perhaps I'll wait a bit before venturing there myself. Let this whole thing blow over, you know. Give certain parties a chance to forget what I may have done. Still, you've gotten me out of that cage, and I won't forget it. Thank you again, and good luck to you."" Find the exit and leave Fellglow Keep. You may still need to kill the Caller to obtain the key to the exit. Night of Tears[edit] When you arrive back at the College, you will find that Tolfdir has returned from Saarthal and placed the Orb in the Hall of the Elements. Head into the Arcanaeum and locate Urag gro-Shub. Out of the three books, Night of Tears, The Last King of the Ayleids, and Fragment: On Artaeum, he will be particularly interested in the first one, as it has some interesting implications. The quest ends with him handing you a bunch of books as reward (see this section) and asks you to speak to Tolfdir. The next quest, Good Intentions, will then start."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Horn_of_Jurgen_Windcaller","Attempt to retrieve the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller from Ustengrav. Meet with whoever took the Horn in Riverwood. Return the Horn to Arngeir. Learn the Word of Power from Wulfgar. Receive the Greybeards' formal recognition.","Ustengrav[edit] After completing The Way of the Voice, Arngeir will assign you one last task to prove you are Dragonborn: retrieve the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, so named after the founder of the Greybeards. The Horn is located in the ruin of Ustengrav, which Arngeir marks on your map. The simplest way to reach Ustengrav is to take a carriage to the town of Morthal, then travel the marshes on foot. The ruins are due northeast of the town. If you wish to walk, the fastest route from the Throat of the World is to pass through the fields around Whiterun and follow the route northwest directly through Labyrinthian. However, this route will require you to deal with the multiple frost trolls that roam the exterior of Labyrinthian. When you arrive at Ustengrav, you'll encounter some bandits who have been enthralled by a necromancer. You may also encounter a mudcrab. Once the danger has passed, travel into the ruin. The first level of the ruin is fairly straightforward, with a few bandits, warlocks, and draugr to deal with, or let them kill each other. The groups here are often small enough to be handled alone. They are also hostile to each other, so sneaking and following the mages deeper into the ruin will allow for the groups to thin each other. Deal with any remaining draugr and descend into the second zone of the ruin.  Note: More detailed information about Ustengrav can be found on this page.  Into the Depths[edit] Skeletons dwell in the depths. Upon entering Ustengrav Depths, you will see a sparsely forested chasm with a waterfall and a bridge far below. To descend, navigate the winding path through the rest of the ruin. You will encounter several draugr and a fire trap along the way. The outdoor area itself hosts several skeleton archers, both on the ground by the bridge and in the somewhat higher level with the wooden barricade. These can be easily defeated with ranged attacks. In the room with the tall pillars, a skeleton seated on a throne will come to life at your approach. If you jump to the rocks on the left at the top of the ramp leading down into the room, then jump and use Whirlwind Sprint between the circular platforms on the pillars, you will reach a secret room with a soul gem and a chest. Near the bottom of the waterfall is a word wall with a word for the Become Ethereal shout. It can be seen from the bridge, and is reachable by a small path carved from the side of the cave wall. Behind the waterfall is a hidden area containing a draugr and small amounts of loot. The Horn, however, lies on the other side of the bridge. After gaining the word, return up the path and cross the bridge. On the way back up, on the right side, there is a ramp leading up to a ledge with a chest; a corundum and a silver vein can be found nearby. Red glowing runes Across the bridge, a lone skeleton can be found. It can easily be dispatched. The main feature, of the area, are the three outcrops of rock carved with runes. There is also a tunnel with all of its gates down. Each of the rocks glows red at your approach and lifts one of the gates barring passage through the tunnel. However, the gates will often shut soon upon opening. The easiest solution is to use the Whirlwind Sprint shout, using it to sprint through the stones opens the gates long enough to walk through them all. Once you are clear, the gates will remain fully open, allowing any followers to catch up. With only one word of the shout learned, getting all three gates to stay open long enough is trickier. The gate can be opened by starting at the rock closest to the bridge, sprint by each of them until you get close to the tunnel entrance, and from there use Whirlwind Sprint to clear all the gates at once. It is also possible to stand in front of the first rock, use Whirlwind Sprint, and then run through the rest of the tunnel. It is also possible to stand between the first two rocks to open the first two gates, use Whirlwind Sprint and then run; the third gate should stay open by then. If you become trapped between gates inside the tunnel, you will find pull chains that will allow you to return to the rocks and try again. The floors of the next few chambers are covered with fire traps. There are two frostbite spiders on the cobwebbed arch. The pair of spiders can be lured onto the traps. It's possible to avoid the traps by staying close to the walls. The traps have a slightly delayed reaction to your passing over them, so if you're on your own, you can get away by using the Whirlwind Sprint shout, or the Become Ethereal shout, or just sprinting forward and you won't be badly burned. The sides also contain some areas of trap free space (The lighter tiles are safe to step on, while the darker ones will trigger flame traps). The Sneak perk, Light Foot, will also work for bypassing the trap. Another solution is to shoot the tiles with a spell such as Firebolt or Ice Spike. Flames/Sparks, etc. do not work. The impact of a bolt or spike is enough to set off the trap if it is not a safe tile. Any follower brought here may be in danger as long as you are in the trapped area. They will continuously take damage from the traps. After walking through here, you will find a large room. This room contains a more powerful giant spider hiding in the ceiling, as well as smaller spiders. The giant spider will attempt to ambush you when you get close. Using resist poison and resist frost potions may help you survive this encounter. After dispatching the spiders, cut or burn through the two sets of cobwebs covering the tunnel. If you are collecting alchemical ingredients, you will find three spider eggs in the egg sacs in the spiders' nest. Otherwise, go right ahead and enter the final chamber.  Note for the Dragonborn[edit] A mysterious note? As you make your way through the final room, four Nordic dragon carvings rise out of pools of water. On the pedestal where the Horn should be resting, you will instead find  a mysterious note addressed to ""the Dragonborn"". It states that the Horn has been removed, and requests that you meet the note's anonymous author by renting an attic room at the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood. The anonymous ""friend"" has politely left the treasure room undisturbed. Having failed the task, do as the note says and go to Riverwood. When you speak to Delphine about renting the appropriate room, she will tell you that there is no attic room, but that you can take the one on the left. Delphine follows you, reveals that she was the one who took the Horn, and gives the Horn to you. She asks to speak privately, and she will lead you to the room across from yours. Delphine opens the wardrobe door, revealing a secret room beneath the inn. In this room, she tells you that her organization has been looking for someone like you, and that she took the Horn in order to get your attention. This exchange with her begins the quest A Blade in the Dark. After speaking with her, you are free to return the Horn to High Hrothgar and complete the quest.  Return to High Hrothgar[edit] Return to High Hrothgar with the Horn and present it to Arngeir, completing the task he originally gave you. Arngeir will go to the main hall, where the other Greybeards are assembled, and Wulfgar will teach you the final word of the Unrelenting Force shout. There the Greybeards will speak to you at once in the dragon language, formally recognizing you as Dragonborn. (You are not harmed by this exchange.)

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Horse_Whisperer","Travel to a stables. Purchase a map and book for 250 gold. (Optional) Track down and tame all seven wild horses.","Horse Tamer[edit] Upon reading Soran's Journal located on Urag gro-Shub's desk in the Arcanaeum, this quest will automatically begin and will direct you to the nearest stables.[verification needed — how is this selected?] You will need to speak with the hostler, i.e. the NPC who sells horses. (NOTE: I received the opportunity at the Whiterun Stables in a new game to buy the map without performing any of the actions previously outlined.) You will be presented with the option to purchase a wild horse map for 250 gold. You will receive both a Map of Wild Horses and a book called Wild Horse Notes. In conjunction with reading the book, the map can be examined in your inventory in order to locate seven wild horses. Upon making this purchase, this quest will conclude. However, you will then receive seven miscellaneous objectives tasking you with locating and taming every wild horse. The objectives themselves are rather useless as they do not provide a map marker for the individual horses. Instead, you will need to use the map and book to travel to the approximate location and search for the horse. The book itself advises that Detect Life will be useful in carrying out this task. Note that wild horses will flee if you get too close, so it may help to sneak up on them. To tame a wild horse, you must remain mounted on the horse while it bucks. It has a chance to ragdoll you when bucking, which will force you to chase down the fleeing horse once you get back on your feet. Sneaking can help prevent the horse from fleeing too far. Once mounted for a sufficient length of time, the horse becomes an owned mount. If you switch to a different mount, it will slowly make its way back to the location you originally found it. Find and tame the Black Horse[edit] This horse can be found northwest of Falkreath, just south of the map marker for Evergreen Grove. The book refers to nearby ruins, the ruins in question being Cracked Tusk Keep. This location is close to a necromancer's ritual site, and the resident necromancer might interrupt the taming process if you get too close. Find and tame the Chestnut Horse[edit] This horse can be found east of Helgen, along the path leading towards Falkreath Stormcloak Camp. It's off of the north side of the road, just under halfway from Helgen to the Falkreath Stormcloak Camp. Find and tame the Dapple Brown Horse[edit] This horse can be found in the forest south of Solitude Sawmill, across the river but before you reach the dragon mound. This can obviously be a dangerous place to tame a horse if the dragon is still nearby. Find and tame the Grey Spotted Horse[edit] This horse can be found up the hill to the north of Salvius Farm. Beware the nearby sabre cats who will attack you and the horse if you get too close. Find and tame the Pale Mare[edit] This horse can be found among a group of snowy pines just south of Yngol Barrow. Find and tame the Red Horse[edit] This horse can be found on the plains of Whiterun Hold, northwest of Whiterun Stables. It is a very easy mount to locate and tame, particularly at the start of the game. Find and tame the White Spotted Horse[edit] This horse can be found directly west of Stony Creek Cave, west of the road, on a green cliff overlooking the volcanic tundra below."

Make Logrolf bow to Molag Bal, then kill him. Receive the Mace of Molag Bal.","The Witchhunter[edit] Tyranus interrogates... In Markarth, the innkeeper at the Silver-Blood Inn may tell you that a witchhunter from the Priesthood of Stendarr recently showed up in town, asking all sorts of questions about the old abandoned house up the street from the main gate. Whether or not you've heard this rumor, you will find Vigilant Tyranus wandering around outside the house, at times bothering the townsfolk with his questions. When he sees you he will actively seek you out and ask if you know anything about the house. Unless you totally reject his questions, he will introduce himself, obviously hoping for a helping hand, and proceed to explain that he believes the house is home to Daedric activities. Agree to help him and he will invite you to come along for the investigation and unlock the door. The Abandoned House[edit] Upon entering the house, everything appears normal, and a puzzled Tyranus comments that it shows no sign of old age as there is fresh food on the table and no wood-rot on the furniture. Immediately after he stops talking, a loud noise comes from downstairs. Tyranus then takes off running towards the noise, only to be stopped by a locked door. He then asks you to open it. The door is locked, and triggers a voice inside your head: ""Weak. He's weak. You're strong. Crush him."" At the same time, the furniture and items in the house will start floating in mid-air, causing Tyranus to panic and run upstairs, yelling, ""Stendarr's Mercy! This isn't an ordinary Daedra. We have to get help."" He will then run all the way upstairs, only to be impeded by the front door, which is now locked tight. He asks you to leave first and when you touch the door, the malevolent voice will once again resonate, not only in your head, but in that of Tyranus as well: ""No. Kill him. Crush his bones. Tear at his flesh. You will kill. You will kill, or you will die!"" ""Stendarr's Mercy! This isn't an ordinary Daedra."" Tyranus will slowly start to panic and forget his righteousness, shouting to the unknown entity inside his mind. When he eventually realizes that there is only one way out, he will draw his mace and proceed to attack you, succumbing to the orders of the mysterious Daedra in the hopes of preserving his own life. He will use several spells, including sparks, lesser ward, healing and oakflesh, determined not to die in the haunted house. Unfortunately, you are in the same situation and will have no choice but to defend yourself, with an inevitable outcome. This seems to amuse the voice: ""Yes. Your reward is waiting for you, mortal. Further down."" The previously locked door is now open, and leads further into the house. Past this door, the voice leads you through a food storage larder, where a hole in the wall reveals a subterranean tunnel, which leads to an altar where your reward, a rusty mace, awaits. Molag Bal, Lord of Domination[edit] When you try to grab your reward, a set of spikes will immediately shoot up from the floor and trap you in place. You can do nothing but face the altar as it now speaks directly to you: ""Fool! Did you think Molag Bal, the Lord of Domination, would so easily reward you? What do you see from that little cage? Speak."" The voice belongs to the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, whose main ambition and desire is to harvest the souls of mortals and bring them to his own Plane of Oblivion, Coldharbour. You now have three dialogue options. You can tell him you see a rusted mace, and he will say: ""Rusted. Dry. There was a time when this mace dripped with the blood of the feeble and the worthless. But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate it. Left it here to decay. Until you came."" If you instead tell him it's an altar, he will reply: ""Yes. It's an altar. Men would come and sacrifice the wretched in my name. The weak would be punished by the strong. But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate the altar. Until you came."" You can also tell him you only see the spikes of his trap, to which he will respond: ""Sharp, aren't they? This was the last thing many saw before they were sacrificed in my name. But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate it. So long since it's tasted blood. Until you came."" Depending on your response, he will then say either: ""Revenge? No. I want submission. I want the priest who did this to bend his knee and give me his soul. He comes by to perform Boethiah's insulting rites at my altar, but he's been missing. Captured and bound. Left to rot. Save him. Let him perform his rite one more time. And when he does, we will be waiting for him."" or ""Fine. I offered you a reward. You'll get the freedom your kind enjoys so much. But Boethiah's priest is imprisoned as well. But not by me. He is hurt. Suffering. Save him. Let him perform his rites one more time. And when he does, I will be waiting for him."" The altar will then be quiet and inactive, patiently waiting for you to ""rescue"" the unfortunate priest and bring him back to the altar, so that Molag Bal can bring yet another soul to his realm. Your quest journal will update and point you towards one out of six possible locations, all located in the Reach and inhabited by Forsworn, who are the ones responsible for imprisoning the priest of Boethiah. Leave the house and altar behind and travel to the specified location. Possible locations: Broken Tower Redoubt • Bruca's Leap Redoubt • Deepwood Redoubt • Druadach Redoubt • Hag Rock Redoubt • Red Eagle Redoubt Logrolf the Willful The Pious Priest of Boethiah[edit] When you find the dungeon, make sure to clear the place entirely of Forsworn, as the captive priest will attempt to make his own way out of his prison. When you finally locate the captured worshipper of Boethiah, he turns out to be an elderly, grumpy priest named Logrolf the Willful. He will be tied and kneeling and will, despite his precarious situation, have quite a bit of a high and mighty attitude, referring to himself as 'the mighty Logrolf'. When you tell him you are there to rescue him he will immediately become suspicious: ""Rescue? No one knew where I was, when I was taken. Who sent you?"" You can now choose to persuade, bribe or intimidate him. Note that you need a Speech skill of 50 to successfully persuade Logrolf:  Option  Dialogue  Reaction   Boethiah has sent me. (Persuade) Passed: The Dark Mistress? She sent you? Wait. Molag Bal's altar. Of course. I have to get to Markarth at once. Cut me loose.Failed: The Dark Mistress? Sent you? Ha. Now tell me the one about the Troll who gives gifts to good little boys and girls. Passed: Return to Molag BalFailed: Nothing   Does it matter? Here. (Bribe) Passed: Fine. I won't ask questions. Cut me loose.Failed: You think it's money I need? I'm a prisoner, not a beggar. Passed: Return to Molag BalFailed: Nothing   Molag Bal. (Intimidate) Passed: So. The King of Corruption sends his messenger to challenge me. Very well. I will meet with Molag Bal, and I will venerate his altar in Boethiah's name, as I did before. Cut me loose, minion of the Hated One. I need to get to Markarth.Failed: You? A servant of the King of Corruption? Has the beast's standards fallen so far? Tell me another one. Passed: Return to Molag BalFailed: Nothing   Never mind. Stay here. I have a choice? Nothing After you have untied his binds, he will take off running towards Markarth, determined to single-handedly save humanity once again in the name of his beloved Boethiah. Make sure he gets out safely, then travel to Markarth and re-enter the abandoned house. You can also choose to kill him at this point. Doing so will fail this quest. Make Him Bend to Me[edit] Inside the house, the oh-so righteous priest will head right into the basement, without thinking twice. When he reaches the foot of the altar, Molag Bal will trap him right away and a conversation will take place: Logrolf: ""Molag Bal. You think you can best Boethiah's faithful? I have won this contest before!"" Molag Bal: ""Ah. But I have my own champion this time, Logrolf.""  Logrolf: ""What? You!"" Molag Bal: ""Mortal. I give you my mace, in all its rusted spitefulness. Crush the spirit from Logrolf's bones. Make him bend to me."" The rusty mace will then be equipped and you will have no other choice than to help Molag Bal humiliate the elderly man. You will have to repeatedly beat the defenseless priest as he quivers, and ultimately kill him. Once he is dead, Molag Bal will revive him, ready for yet another beating. When Logrolf's spirit is finally broken, he will bend before Molag Bal as requested: ""You're mine now, Logrolf."" Molag Bal: ""You bend to me?""  Logrolf: ""Yes!"" Molag Bal: ""You pledge your soul to me?""  Logrolf: ""Yes!"" Molag Bal: ""You forsake the weak and pitiful Boethiah?""  Logrolf: ""Yes!"" Molag Bal: ""You're mine now, Logrolf."" With the victory, Molag Bal will lose interest in the torture session and will, mercifully, ask you to put Logrolf out of his misery. The frail old man is already weakened considerably and will not be able to defend himself, so kill him right there in the cage. Lastly, a triumphant Molag Bal will turn the rusty mace into the Mace of Molag Bal, finishing the quest with the words: ""The Mace of Molag Bal! I give you its true power, mortal. When your enemies lie broken and bloody before you, know that I will be watching. Now, I have a soul in Oblivion that needs claiming. Take care of the house while I'm gone. Ha ha ha!"""
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hrodulf%27s_Madness","Note: This quest does not appear in your journal (see this section for details). Investigate Hrodulf's House. Fight the reavers in the cellar. Uncover the secret behind the bookshelf. Find out what happened to Hrodulf and Bjornolfr.","Hrodulf's House[edit] On the hill between Fort Frostmoth and the Wreck of the Strident Squall lies the charred remains of a shack called Hrodulf's House. Not much is left of the original interior and the house is seemingly uninhabited and partly covered in ash. When you approach the premises, two ash spawn will rise from the ashes and attack. Dispose of them and look around for some minor loot in a chest, an East Empire Company strongbox holding a pendant for the quest Pain in the Necklace, and finally, a trap door leading to a secret underground basement. The Reavers[edit] ""Listen to this one!"" Downstairs, you will find a much more comfortable room, complete with a table, bookshelves, and food, but also some unwanted visitors, specifically two reavers hiding from the ash spawn you just confronted upstairs. You will land in a safe spot behind a corner, so you can overhear the conversation: Reaver #1: ""Listen to this one! 'My nights have been impossible to bear without you. I beg of you: Please depart that blasted isle and return to Solitude at once!'"" Reaver #2: ""Ha ha ha! No more! What a fool."" Reaver #1: ""Do you think he's the one we left in the tunnel?"" Reaver #2: ""Who cares? Nords all look the same to me."" Reaver #1: ""Ha! Wait... Did you hear that? Sounds like those Ash Spawn are back."" Reaver #2: ""Well, at least if the other Nord returns, they'll take care of him."" After the conversation, the reavers will start walking towards you and the trapdoor, so expose yourself and battle them both. Once they are dead, investigate the table and read the letter that amused them so much. Follow the Clues[edit] The letter is from a Solitude citizen named Bjornolfr and is addressed to his lover, Hrodulf. In the letter Bjornolfr shows great concern about the welfare of Hrodulf, and encourages him to leave Solstheim and return to Solitude. Look around the room and locate Hrodulf's journal on the crate to the north. Read through it and learn about the growing madness of newcomer Hrodulf who moved into the house, only to be obsessed with a strange rumbling from the basement, in his own words, ""a calling from the depths"". As his madness escalated, Hrodulf went to town and bought various tools for digging, and apparently broke down a wall behind one of the bookshelves, obsessed with solving the mystery about the voices from beyond. Before the journal turns into the ramblings of a madman, Hrodulf shows concern about Bjornolfr and the possibility that he would travel to Solstheim and seek out Hrodulf in his house. Hrodulf, however, is nowhere to be found in the basement and you will have no choice but to investigate the bookshelves and find the one you can push aside. Fire From the Deep[edit] What lies beneath Behind the bookshelf is the tunnel created by Hrodulf in his desperate attempt to uncover the secret in his basement. The noises from below can be heard clearly, and as you delve underground, a small chamber reveals several Dwemer machines, all of them still functioning and pumping. Lying on the ground is Bjornolfr, who obviously found the journal and went down there looking for his lover, but found the two reavers instead. On his body you will find a bloodstained letter, Hrodulf's cryptic plea to Bjornolfr to stay away from the house. The chamber itself contains various dwemer artifacts, three dwarven metal ingots, two dwemer chests, one of them boss-leveled, and some gold coins scattered around. Hrodulf, however, is still missing and nothing will point you to his location. On the coast south of Hrodulf's house, you will find a canoe and a burnt spriggan standing over the corpse of Hrodulf, and some rare scrap metal (a Broken Iron War Axe Head and Handle). He seemingly realized his madness and tried to escape Solstheim in the canoe, but his life instead ended at the hands of a wilderness creature, having caused the death of his lover through his obsession with the strange voices."

Accept Hircine's challenge. Face Sinding inside Bloated Man's Grotto and make a choice. Speak with Hircine.","Falkreath[edit] The burial of Lavinia A plethora of battles have taken place in Falkreath Hold throughout the eras, and the bloodshed has taken its toll on the small hold capital of Falkreath. The town has the questionable honor of hosting the largest graveyard in all of Skyrim, and the few resident merchants and innkeepers have named their shops or taverns in honor of the numerous deceased warriors. But while the ongoing civil war keeps its distance for the time being, Falkreath still experiences its share of death, as evidenced by a visit to the graveyard. On your first visit (between 6 in the morning and 10 in the evening), the town priest, Runil, is busy saying the last rites for little Lavinia, the only daughter of local farmers Mathies and Indara Caerellia: ""The god Arkay was once like us, bound to winding mortality. But he willingly gave up this existence that we might better understand the vagaries of life and death. It is through the ebb and flow of this cosmic tide that we find renewal and, in the end, peace. May the spirit of Lavinia and all those who have left this world and its suffering know the beloved serenity of Aetherius... and may we one day rejoin them in eternity."" After the sad ceremony, the three will go their separate ways. Sinding[edit] Locate the grieving father, Mathies, who can usually be found working his crops behind Corpselight Farm. When asked about his tragedy he will tell you that his nine-year-old, Lavinia, was ripped apart by a laborer named Sinding, now rotting in jail for his deed. The quest will begin and Mathies' last words will be: ""What could drive a man to do something like this?"" In Falkreath, the jail is built in the basement of Falkreath Barracks. Sinding, the alleged killer, sits in the northeastern cell waiting for his death sentence. When you get close he will approach the bars and you can ask him directly if he killed the little girl: ""Believe me, it wasn't anything I ever intended to do. I just... lost control. I tried to tell them, but none of them believe me. It's all on account of this blasted ring."" The Ring of Hircine[edit] Sinding escapes Sinding will then show you the Ring of Hircine and reveal that he is secretly a werewolf who stole the ring from the Daedric Prince of the Hunt in an attempt to control his transformations. In retaliation, Hircine cursed the ring and Sinding's plan backfired; he transformed at the worst possible time, in front of the little girl who never stood a chance. However, Sinding has a plan: ""I've been looking for a way to appease Hircine. There is a certain beast in these lands. Large, majestic. It's said that Hircine will commune with whoever slays it. I tracked it into these woods, but then had my... accident with the child. I want to beg his forgiveness. Give him back the ring. But while I'm stuck in here, the beast wanders free."" You can now offer to bring the ring to Hircine, and Sinding will gladly accept: ""Oh my. You would do this for me? Here, take it. I don't want anything to do with this wretched thing anymore. Seek out the beast. He wanders these woods. Bring him down and... well, the Lord of the Hunt should smile on you. I wish you luck, but should leave here while I still have my skin. Should our paths cross again, I will remember your kindness. Farewell."" Without the Ring of Hircine, Sinding will then transform right in front of you and claw his way to the ceiling of the cell where he disappears. When you are ready to leave, the patrolling guard may approach you and notice: ""You... you were talking to that murderous savage. And then he escaped. What are you hiding?"" NOTE: If you are a lycanthrope, the ring will cause you to randomly transform into your beast form, which may cause a significant bounty if triggered at the wrong time. If you are not infected, the ring's only effect will be to take up your finger slot. Hunting the White Stag[edit] The White Stag The Aspect of Hircine appears The great beast turns out to be a unique deer named White Stag and can be found in an unmarked clearing east of Falkreath, usually drinking water from a small pond. If you are spotted, the stag will usually howl, then set off at a running pace up the mountain. Do your best to catch up with it, or make effective use of your long-range weapons to hit it. Once you've killed it, the Aspect of Hircine will emerge from the dead stag, talking to you: ""I am the spirit of the hunt, just one glimpse of the glorious stalker that your kind calls Hircine."" Naturally, as a Daedric Prince, Hircine will have a few extra tricks up his sleeve and will not simply take the ring you offer. Instead he will ask a favor: ""I may consider it. But you must first do a service for my glory. The one who stole it has fled to what he thinks is his sanctuary. Just as a bear climbs a tree to escape the hunt, but only ends up trapping himself. Seek out this rogue shifter. Tear the skin from his body, and make it an offering to me."" At this point, you can accept or decline, but it will make little difference; you are to travel to Bloated Man's Grotto, or someone else will do it for you. Bloated Man's Grotto[edit] Bloated Man's Grotto is a small cave between Falkreath and Whiterun, normally inhabited by bears and spriggans. When you arrive during the quest, however, you will find that the Great Hunt is underway and the Bloodmoon dominates the sky. You will encounter the remains of a small hunting party, with three of the members, Batum gra-Bar, Ma'tasarr and Hoddreid, already dead. A fourth member, J'Kier, is still alive, but fatally wounded. When you approach him, he will say: ""The prey is strong. Stronger than the hunters. But more will come. Bring him down, for the glories of Lord Hircine."" The wounded Khajiit will then drop dead. Loot the corpses and a locked chest behind the camp. There is also a chest in the small 'lake' where the waterfall is. After looting the chests, follow the northern path until Sinding appears on a rock above. He will be confused as to why you are there to hunt him down: ""I can't stop you if that's what you want to do. Hircine is too powerful. But if you spare me, I can be a powerful ally to you. And I would promise to never return to civilized life. I know now that I can't live among people."" He will then wait for your response, and your decision will not only affect the reward, it may also affect your achievements.  Hunted downHircine's WillIf you choose to follow Hircine's will, you will have no choice but to challenge Sinding, who will respect your decision: ""So be it."" After that, he will jump down from the ledge, and you must hunt him down. At this point, several hunters will spawn in the cave, all of them under oath to the Daedric Prince, and they will all go for Sinding. Make your way up the stairs to the northeast and pass through the small ruin. There is another locked chest shortly after the 'bone alarm' doorway, on the player's right. As you make your way down in a western direction, you will stumble upon the bodies of several dead hunters, all of them too weak to kill Sinding. When you reach a small streamlet, Sinding should be finished with the hunters and will come rushing towards you. You will have no choice but to pick the fight and slay him. Activate the dead body and claim his skin, and the Aspect of Hircine, a ghostly version of Sinding himself, will manifest before you, saying: ""You've done well, hunter."" When told that you did as commanded, he will respond: ""And found my favor. That skin will serve you well, child. Look more closely at it. My glories shall protect you from all this world's grievances. Good hunting."" He will then remove the cursed ring, and change Sinding's skin to the reward, the unique Savior's Hide. Savior's Hide is the only light cuirass in the game with a resist magic enchantment, and one of only two armors. (The other armor is the Lord's MailCC)    Hunter vs HunterHelp SindingIf you choose to go against Hircine's will and spare Sinding, he will gratefully thank you and encourage you to hunt with him. Find the northeastern stairway, and join Sinding on the cliff. As you move forward, not forgetting to loot the chest on your right, you will encounter the first two hunters, Rissing and Tsrasuna, both of them hostile. Defeat them and be careful not to hit Sinding, or he will turn hostile as well. Keep moving forward and face another wave of hunters, including Torkild the Fearsome, Yar gro-Gatuk and Eriana. Follow the path back to the campsite where three more hunters, Ra'kheran, Heratar and Ahjisi, will attack you and Sinding. When all the hunters are dead, approach Sinding: ""Thank you for your help. I will make my home here, away from anyone I might hurt."" This will end the quest, with no reward. However, when you exit the grotto, you will encounter the Aspect of Hircine once again, as you failed to follow his wishes. Two options are available, and will both lead to the same conclusion: ""By bringing down my other Hunters, you turned the chase inside out. And they were no base prey. You continue to amuse and impress. Go forth, with my blessing."" He will then remove the curse from the Ring of Hircine and let you keep it as a reward. The Ring of Hircine allows werewolves to transform an unlimited number of times per day.  Multiple Rewards[edit] NOTE: It is entirely possible to obtain both rewards, or both rings, although it could be considered cheating. Please click the show button for tips and tricks, and remember to save your game before attempting: Tips and Tricks → MULTIPLE REWARDS It is entirely possible to obtain both the Ring of Hircine as well as the Savior's Hide. In order to do so:  Talk to Sinding and tell him you will spare his life. Help Sinding eliminate the remaining hunters. Make sure to save your game at this point! Tell Sinding that the Hunters are dead, exit the cave and the Aspect of Hircine will appear again, granting you the Ring of Hircine. Go back into the cave, give both rings to your follower/place in chest, kill Sinding, take his hide and receive the Savior's Hide from Hircine. It has been reported that the above does not work in all cases. If you find yourself unable to skin Sinding after murdering him, reload the save from after killing the other hunters, then proceed to:  Tell Sinding that the Hunters are dead. Kill Sinding, take his hide and receive the Savior's Hide from Hircine. Exit the cave and the Aspect of Hircine will appear again, granting you the Ring of Hircine. BOTH RINGS It is possible to get the Savior's Hide and both Rings of Hircine, but you must have transformed to be able to do this, as you cannot unequip the ring otherwise.  Opt to kill the hunters rather than Sinding at the start of the quest. Talk to Sinding and place the Cursed Ring of Hircine in a chest in Bloated Man's Grotto or give it to a follower. Exit the Grotto, and receive the ring from the Aspect of Hircine. Go back, kill Sinding and take the skin from his body to receive the Savior's Hide. Retrieve your Cursed Ring of Hircine from the chest or follower. Note: If you attempt to heal Sinding he will turn hostile. ALTERNATE PROCEDURE  Help Sinding and kill the hunters. Place cursed ring in chest. Go outside. Hircine will talk to you. Don't respond. Exit the conversation and go back to the cave. Kill Sinding, skin, talk to Hircine (the one inside the Grotto) and get Savior's Hide. Place Savior's Hide in chest. Go outside. The other Hircine will still be there. Talk to him and get the good ring. Go back to the chest inside and get the cursed ring and Savior's Hide. ANOTHER ALTERNATE PROCEDURE  Help Sinding and kill the hunters. Kill Sinding and take the skin from his body. Hircine will talk to you. Don't respond. Exit the conversation and exit the cave. Outside the grotto receive the purified ring from the other Aspect of Hircine. Go back inside, turn in the skin from Sinding's body to receive the Savior's Hide."

Forge the prison registry. Tell Olfrid the job has been done.","A Special Job[edit] Once you have completed five Thieves Guild extra jobs in the city of Whiterun, Delvin at the Ragged Flagon will have a ""special job"" for you. Delvin explains that he has received word from Olfrid Battle-Born, a wealthy Nord living in Whiterun, with a unique request. Travel to Whiterun and speak to Olfrid, who explains that ""Arn"", one of his old war buddies wanted for murder in Solitude, has been arrested for drunkenness in Whiterun. In order to save his friend from the executioner's block, he wants to set Arn up with a new identity. To accomplish this he asks you to steal a letter warning of Arn's true crime and then change Arn's name on the Whiterun prison registry. With these done the guards will be permanently off the trail and Arn will be given a prompt release. Olfrid warns you the job will not be easy; both items are located in Dragonsreach: the letter is in the jarl's chambers and the registry is on the steward's desk. Rename the Prisoner[edit] The jarl's chambers are always accessible, but your status with the jarl determines whether you can simply walk off with the letter in his room or if you must steal it. If you do not have a standing relationship with the jarl, the guards will be on alert, so you will want to sneak through the rooms. Closing the chamber doors before taking the letter and altering the prison ledger minimizes your chances of being caught. The Payoff[edit] Olfrid is grateful that his friend will only have to spend a few days in jail for his drunkenness instead of facing an executioner's axe for murder, and gives you a random enchanted ring as a reward. Report back to Delvin for your pay. Delvin will inform you that Olfrid has ""pledged the full support of the Battle-Born clan to the Thieves Guild"", and that a new merchant has set up shop in the Flagon."

The bounty points you in the direction of west of Broken Fang Cave. After reading the bounty, speak to Viriya: I see. You hired someone to catch a juvenile mudcrab, but they never returned.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:In_My_Time_Of_Need","Get the quest from the Alik'r Warriors in Whiterun. Find Saadia at The Bannered Mare. Speak with her or report her to the Alik'r in Rorikstead. Kill Kematu or lure Saadia to the stables. Collect your reward from Kematu or Saadia.","A Wanted Woman[edit] Outside the Holds, you may come across Alik'r Warriors interrogating a Redguard woman in the Skyrim wilderness. After Irileth informs the jarl about the dragon attacking the Western Watchtower during Dragon Rising, you may return to Whiterun and observe an argument between Whiterun guards and Alik'r Warriors regarding their presence in the hold. Speak with the warriors to start the quest. Finding the Missing Woman[edit] Go to The Bannered Mare. The Redguard is a woman named Saadia. There will be a new dialogue option to tell her that some Alik'r warriors are looking for a Redguard woman. She will ask to speak to you privately. Follow her upstairs to her room, where she will draw her dagger on you, being suspicious of you - however, she quickly calms down. She explains that her real name is Iman, and that she is a noble of House Suda in Hammerfell. According to her, the Alik'r are assassins sent by the Aldmeri Dominion to deport her back to Hammerfell for an execution, as she spoke out against the Aldmeri Dominion. She asks you to help her get rid of the threat, and points you to the Dragonsreach Dungeon where one of the Alik'r warriors were captured. There is no hard evidence provided in game by Saadia or the Alik'r that definitively supports one side. Thus, it is up to you to pass judgment and choose who to help during the quest. At this point, you can make a choice: Speak to the Alik'r warriors in Rorikstead and tell them of Saadia's location. Follow Saadia's instructions in order to help her. There are other alternative routes (see below) that allow you to reap even greater rewards. Defend a Helpless Dissident...[edit] If you decide to help Saadia, go into the dungeon of Dragonsreach and speak with an Alik'r Warrior that was captured. Talking to him reveals that he was caught sneaking into Whiterun and was captured. As a result, the other Alik'r have abandoned him, and he agrees to tell you where Kematu and the other Alik'r are hiding on the condition that you pay his fine. Talking to him again before paying his fine will allow you to say the following - however this may cause a bug (see bugs): Let's talk about how we can help each other. ""You buy my way out of here, and I'll tell you what you want to know."" The same dialogue will occur after you pay his fine, but there will be an option to tell him you have paid his fine. However, talking to him a second time before paying his fine may cause a bug (see bugs). You will have to bribe the guard to set him free. Picking a guard's pocket (or murdering a guard in the jail) for the key to Whiterun's jail cells will unlock his cell - however, he will fail to register this, and insist that you bribe a guard. After paying 100 gold to a guard, the prisoner will tell you that the leader of the Alik'r is in a cave west of Whiterun called Swindler's Den. If you have already cleared out Swindler's Den, a new dialogue option will appear when speaking with Saadia, revealing to her that you already know where the Alik'r are and allowing you to skip this part of the quest. Swindler's Den[edit] Kematu, the Alik'r leader Upon reaching Swindler's Den, you will find that it's full of bandits. Make your way through the network of tunnels until you reach a passage flooded with water with a waterfall at the end. When you approach the waterfall, the Alik'r leader Kematu will say: ""Alik'r, hold! You've proven your strength, warrior. Let's avoid any more bloodshed. I think you and I have some things to talk about."" As soon as you walk through the waterfall, Kematu should initiate conversation. He explains that unlike what Saadia suggested, the Alik'r are not assassins. He claims that Saadia is wanted by the noble houses of Hammerfell for treason, for selling the city of Taneth out to the Aldmeri Dominion during the Great War. He asks you to help him bring her to justice, by leading her to the Whiterun Stables under the pretense that the Alik'r are coming for her, where he will be waiting to take her into custody. If you still wish to help Saadia, telling Kematu at any point during the dialogue that you still intend to kill him will cause him to become hostile after telling you that he had hoped you would see reason. Fighting the host of Alik'r warriors can be made easier by using the bear traps at the mouth of the winding path that leads into the cave where Kematu awaits. The warriors get hung up in the path, allowing the traps to be reset. Success is facilitated by focusing on your high-offense attack while retreating. Once your stamina or magic is depleted, turn and run for the traps, being careful to jump over them as you pass. It is also possible to simply exit the conversation with Kematu (or tell him that you will help lure Saadia away), sneak into the room just ahead, and snipe all the warriors with your bow. Once the Alik'r are dead, loot Kematu's corpse for bonus gold, then return to Saadia in the Bannered Mare for your reward. ...Or Bring a Traitor to Justice[edit] Saadia and Kematu at Whiterun Stables If you decide to help the Alik'r capture Saadia, Kematu or the Redguards with whom you spoke in Rorikstead will ask you to lure her to the stables outside of Whiterun. Go back and talk to Saadia in The Bannered Mare, where you can lie to her, telling her that the Alik'r are coming for her, and that a horse is waiting for her at the Whiterun Stables. Once Saadia gets to the stables, she and Kematu will have a brief exchange before Kematu will use a paralysis spell on her. Talk to him for your reward. Alternative Routes[edit] While Kematu and Saadia are talking at the stables, you can still kill Kematu before he casts the spell on Saadia. This will get you the reward from Saadia and the 100 gold that Kematu is carrying, without having to fight the rest of the Alik'r. Saadia will be annoyed that you didn't warn her of what you were going to do, but she will thank you nonetheless. Alternatively, allow Kematu to cast the spell on Saadia and collect the 500 gold reward, thus ending the quest, then kill Kematu to undo the spell on Saadia. At this point, Saadia will be hostile right away, so use a Calm spell on her, then talk to her, and she will give you the 500 gold reward for killing Kematu. You can then loot Kematu's body to get 100 gold, Hammerfell Garb and Redguard Boots, and two scimitars. Once the Calm spell ends, Saadia will become hostile again - this is a permanent state, so even if you leave the area, she will attack the next time you meet her. This is not a problem, as Saadia is not essential, and killing her will not give you a bounty. Looting her will give you gold and jewels. Both characters will be dead, but you will have gained 600 gold, including random jewels, scimitars, and their clothing."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:In_the_Shadows","Read the Steward's Note. Take the ledger copy at Arcadia's Cauldron. Read the Business Ledger Copy. Investigate the Hall of the Dead. Check the stables. Investigate the Silent Moons Camp. Find the Assassin on the upper floor of Dragonsreach when the Jarl is unoccupied. Retrieve the Bow of Shadows. Speak to the Jarl's Steward.","An Assassination Plot[edit] Talk to Proventus Avenicci (or Brill if Balgruuf has been exiled) and ask if he has anything for you. He will hand you a note, explaining that he is concerned of an assassination plot on Jarl Balgruuf the Greater from an anonymous informer. He dare not tell it to you out loud due to the Jarl already having plenty on his plate, as well as the fact that he is unsure of its credibility. Proventus would like you to visit Arcadia's Cauldron and look through their business ledger to spot any suspicious purchases; to this end he has asked Arcadia to leave you a copy to peruse. Suspicious Purchases[edit] Head to Arcadia's Cauldron and you will find the business ledger on the counter. Unlike the typical business ledgers, this one you can pick up; do so and look through it to find that two people - a Priest of Arkay and a Nord Stable Boy - have made purchases of poisons. Time to investigate and look at their motives for doing so. The Hall of the Dead[edit] Enter the Hall of the Dead and then the Whiterun Catacombs; note that if you have not entered this location before there will be hostile skeletons in this area - either kill or avoid them. Once you enter, descend down the flight of stairs to your left and you will find a dead skeever, a block of cheese, the poison in question and a note, explaining that the poison had been applied to the cheese in an attempt to rid the place of the skeever infestation. Whiterun Stables[edit] Exit Whiterun proper and down the path to the stables, where you will find a dead Nord behind a haystack of the leftmost stall. Beside him will be a lunar steel weapon. Loot the Nord and find upon him a note as well as a spell tome of Detect Life; like before, read the note and find that the Nord has been posing as a stable boy. The note also states that he was supposed to meet a Dark Elf at this location instead of at Silent Moons Camp and the spell tome was to help the Nord in locating him as the Dark Elf snuck up on him the last time, though he was apparently unable to get the spell working. Off to Silent Moons Camp[edit] Now that you have your next destination, make your way to Silent Moons Camp. Your objective is at the very back, so if you are so inclined you may opt to go around and hop over the wall, but whichever way you choose, a journal of an assassin will be lying on a table just outside the room containing the Lunar Forge. Again, pick it up and read it, finding largely ramblings but an important detail: the author of this book shall be waiting on the second floor of Dragonsreach, waiting for an opportune time to strike and kill the Jarl. Back Where We Started[edit] Return to Dragonsreach and head up the stairs on the right of the main hall to the second floor, then turn around and make your way out onto the balcony. The area looks clear, but once you reach the end you will find the Dark Elf assassin in question, who had been hiding under a cloak of invisibility; at this point he will become hostile and attack you. (You may also cast Detect Life to locate him if you have learned it from the spell tome you should have obtained earlier, however as he will cease to be invisible once you get close it is not necessary.) He is quite decently armed and can pose a fatal threat if you're of lower level, but luckily you have allies who will help if you lure him downstairs. Note: Rather uniquely, the assassin is marked as protected, which means you must land the killing blow. The assassin will not appear if the Jarl is occupied, and will not appear if you haven't started the quest Bleak Falls Barrow. The Jarl is considered occupied when the following quest stages are active: Bleak Falls Barrow - Stage 10: When Jarl Balgruuf is showing you to Farengar. Dragon Rising - Stages 10, 12, 13, 15, 20, 110, 120, 130, 150: During the scenes inside Dragonsreach at the beginning of the quest and after the Greybeards summon you to High Hrothgar. The Fallen - Stages 25, 27 - When persuading the Jarl about to trap Odahviing in Dragonsreach. At any point during Battle for Whiterun, Battle for Solitude, or Battle for Windhelm. Once the assassin is dead, loot his corpse and find the Bow of Shadows. Speak to Proventus (or Brill) again and gain a monetary reward.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Infiltration","Talk to Stalleo outside Treva's Watch. Enter Treva's Watch through the secret tunnel. Open the Treva's Watch main gate. Talk to Stalleo.","Stalleo[edit] You will find Stalleo next to a campfire along the narrow dirt road just outside of Treva's Watch. Mistaking you for a mercenary, he will tell you that invaders kidnapped his family and took possession of the fort while he and his bodyguards were away fighting in the war. He will tell you that his family is inside, and ask you to use a nearby secret tunnel (Treva's Watch Escape Tunnel; the ""back door"" in your journal) to access the fort, fight your way through, and then use a lever from inside to open the front gate for him. The Back Door/Secret Tunnel[edit] Enter the nearby tunnel indicated by your objective marker. Inside, and around the first corner, three bandits stand at the top of some steps. Shooting down the lamp above them will cause an explosion. A fourth bandit lurks in the adjoining room. You will also find some chests and soul gems there. There is a bear trap on the floor in the next hallway. Follow the hallway and ascend the stairs to find a bandit working at an anvil in the room straight ahead of you. He is facing away, facilitating a sneak attack. Through an open doorway is a small storage room containing the corpses of two Nords and an Imperial. It is possible that this is Stalleo's family, but they are not identified as such. Treva's Watch[edit] Enter through the door into Treva's Watch. Two bear traps lie on the floor just around the turn. Ahead, you will hear two bandits conversing at the top of a stairway. Dispatch them and climb the stairs to find a short ramp ahead leading up to a somewhat crooked hallway. There are two bandits in a bedroom fairly near and to the right. Use caution when engaging these bandits, as the noise from this battle can alert 1-4 other bandits in nearby rooms, including a Bandit Chief and a powerful spellcaster. One way to try to avoid this is to provoke the initial two bandits, then immediately run back in the direction that you came, letting them chase you to fight out of earshot of their allies. In the bedroom, you can find a few potions, including a Potion of Brief Invisibility. Directly across the hall from this, behind a locked door, is a small treasure room. At the end of the hallway, turn right. If you have not already killed the Bandit Chief, he or she will be sitting at a desk in the bedroom up ahead to the left. Again, a noisy battle here can attract the attention of a large nearby group of bandits. The chief will be facing away at a desk, so if you can make it into the room undetected, a sneak attack is possible. A Spell Tome: Bound Sword sits on the chief's desk. Proceeding further into the fort, you will next find yourself on the upper tier of a large dining hall where several bandits are seated. Be prepared for a tough fight, as they will swarm you once alerted and at least one of them will be a powerful mage. A fourth bandit will likely be drawn into the fray from the nearby kitchen area. Make your way through the kitchen and pantry then proceed through a wooden door. To the left is a pressure plate that activates a spike wall trap which can permanently pinch you against the stone wall. This is most likely to happen if a follower or enemy steps on the trap and you manage to get behind the spike wall after it is activated. Proceed around it with caution and make sure that a follower does not set it off. After passing through a medium-sized room containing more smithing materials, you will reach a spiral staircase leading upwards into the fort's tower. Climbing it, you will find two more bandits, including another Chief, and a boss chest. It is also possible to ignore the tower and continue on to complete the quest, but you will miss some treasure. The room at the top contains the enchanting skill book Twin Secrets, and a Spell Tome: Courage sits on a wooden table near the Arcane Enchanter. Up on the tower roof is another chest. You can save yourself some trouble later by standing at the east and south edges of the tower roof and killing with ranged attacks all of the bandits below you on the rooftop encampments and in the courtyard. If you took the stairway, return down and turn right into the hallway. Three leveled bandits await in a guards' room off the left of the hallway. This room contains two locked, empty jail cells. Past that room is a dart trap activated by a pressure plate. Beyond this trap, a door to the left exits into the fort's front courtyard. Continuing straight past this door leads to a pressure plate trap which will release a swinging mace down into the area in front of the chest you can see ahead. Standing on the plate and waiting for the mace to fall will let you avoid receiving any damage. The Courtyard[edit] Once you exit the door, you will find the lever immediately to your left. Unless you have killed all or some of them from the roof of the tower, there will be five or six bandits patrolling the courtyard, most of them guarding the front entrance from elevated platforms and rooftops. If you use the lever to open the entrance gate, Stalleo and his bodyguards will rush in from outside to help you fight them. Stalleo is a wizard and can help greatly in battle, but if you prefer, you can fight the bandits here on your own before opening the gate to let him in. When all the bandits are dead, letting Stalleo know that he's regained possession of his home will complete the quest. When he asks about his family, you only have the option to say that you did not find them. He will then reward you with the Spell Tome: Detect Life."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Innocence_Lost","Speak to Aventus Aretino inside the Aretino Residence in Windhelm. Kill Grelod the Kind in the Honorhall Orphanage in Riften. Return to Aventus for your reward.","The Aretino Residence in Windhelm Initiating the Quest[edit] It seems a strange boy named Aventus Aretino is all the talk in Windhelm. By asking around town you will likely hear that Aventus is attempting to perform the Black Sacrament, a ritual designed to summon a Dark Brotherhood assassin. Once this topic arises in a dialogue, the objective ""Talk to Aventus Aretino"" will appear in your journal as a miscellaneous quest. Speaking to the children at Honorhall Orphanage in Riften will also lead you to Aventus' door. Aventus Aretino[edit] Aventus's fury is revealed You will find Aventus in the Aretino Residence in Windhelm. If entering Windhelm through the main gate, immediately turn right and proceed up the stairs. Continue straight ahead, passing the house on your left, and turn left around its far corner. You should now be heading north, with the house on your left and a crumbling stone wall on your right. The Aretino Residence is a short distance ahead. If this is your first visit to the area, Idesa Sadri will be outside Aventus' house trying to dissuade Grimvar Cruel-Sea from playing with poor Aventus, warning him that, ""...Aventus Aretino walks a dark path"". If you have previously entered the house without the objective in your journal, it will be added at this point. To speak with Aventus, pick the lock on the door where you will discover Aventus performing the Black Sacrament, chanting over and over again. He is so engrossed in the ritual that he fails to notice you. When you speak to him, he will be overjoyed and mistake you for the assassin he was trying to summon, ""I did the Black Sacrament, over and over. With the body, and the... the things. And then you came! An assassin from the Dark Brotherhood!"" He will tell you about his mother's death and that afterward he was sent to Honorhall Orphanage in Riften, where he was subjected to the cruelties of its headmistress, Grelod the Kind. He escaped the orphanage and returned to his home where he set about performing the Sacrament to get his revenge and to ensure that neither he or his friends will have to suffer any more. He expects you to kill Grelod, further stating, ""She's a monster."" You can ask for further details, but whatever the course of your conversation with him, it will conclude with your journal advancing the Innocence Lost quest. He will also ask you not to harm Constance Michel, Grelod's servant, because she was kind to him and the other orphans. Grelod The Dead[edit] Grelod tells the orphans they aren't going anywhere Travel to Honorhall Orphanage in Riften. Here Grelod the Kind is a cruel tyrant, verbally abusing her charges, ""Nobody needs you, nobody wants you"", and that her nickname is a term of endearment that she has bestowed on herself and imposed on the children. Killing Grelod does not constitute a crime so you may kill her in whatever fashion you see fit, however attacking any of the children or Constance is a crime. Whatever manner you choose will be successful as she only has one point of health. While Constance runs about in a panic once Grelod dies, the orphans will come to gloat over the body, expressing reactions ranging from philosophical reflection, ""Kill one person, and you can solve so many problems. I wonder at the possibilities"", to simple joy, ""Hurrah! Hurrah!"" If spoken to, each of the children will share one or more thoughts and feelings about her death. Return to Windhelm and speak to Aventus. He will greet the news with happiness and show his gratitude by giving you a family heirloom, which is ""Supposed to be sort of valuable"", however the dinner plate is only worth 100 gold. This quest counts as a favor quest for Aventus, who is a citizen of Eastmarch. Alternate Path[edit] If you have killed Grelod prior to starting the quest, then when you speak with Aventus for the first time you can tell him that you killed her. He will state that ""I knew the Dark Brotherhood was good... just not that good! You killed the old hag before I even asked!"" There are no negative consequences to the quest and the reward is the same."

Alternatively, you can tell him: Actually, I don't have time to deal with this right now. He will then hand you instructions which explain that the Remnants have agents that have lived in Skyrim for over 20 years, that one lives in the Miner's Barracks in Karthwasten and the other should be waiting for you in front of Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead. Karthwasten[edit] Head to the Miner's Barracks in Karthwasten, where you will find Josla sitting behind the barracks. Speak to her: ""The ravens take flight once more."" ""Of course. Let's both get on with our lives now, hmm?"" She will then hand you a note which states that she overheard that a Hammerfell noble from Sentinel would be crossing the border in the next few days and paid a hefty coin purse to the Thalmor to ensure safe passage to Blacklight. She suspects that the noble is Ismal and that Rakeed would most likely be with him. Ivarstead[edit] Head to the Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead, where you will find Sirayar: ""The ravens take flight once more."" ""I understand. Anyway, it's done. Time to move on."" He will then hand you a note which states that the wagon will be passing by Sunderstone Gorge. Ambush the Thalmor[edit] The Remnants await you. Return to Fijeh at Purewater Run: Ismal has been traveling with a caravan of Thalmor to Morrowind. ""You've done well."" They will enter Skyrim from the southwest, passing by Sunderstone Gorge. ""It just so happens I've got some scouts along the road. Meet up with them, and together see if you can't overpower the caravan."" Sounds good. ""Here. This is for you."" I prefer to work alone. ""I understand. Go in quiet, break our man out, then get out of there. Don't risk combat if you can avoid it. If you can't, then give 'em hell. Here. This is for you."" I'll make sure your man gets out safely. ""Stay sharp out there."" I only want to kill Thalmor. I can't promise anything else. ""It can't be helped."" He will then hand you the key to the remnant supply chest that can be found near him. Unlock the chest and it contains: Remnant Agent Armor Remnant Agent Boots Remnant Agent Gloves Remnant Agent Hood Remnant Shield Remnant Scimitar of Fire x 2 Potion of Extended Invisibility x 2 The Ebon Arm Travel to Sunderstone Gorge where you can either attack the caravan on your own or meetup with the Remnants. Rakeed and the fight. Meet up with the three Remnants and they will charge to the caravan alongside you. You will have to fight four Thalmor soldiers and Ismal, who wields Boneshaver. Once the Thalmor and Ismal have been dispatched, rescue Rakeed: ""Please! Have mercy... I beg you..."" Wait Here. I'll be back. ""This doesn't look good."" (Cut Rakeed's Bonds) ""Thanks a lot."" When freed he will then turn himself invisible and disappear. Additionally before leaving the three remaining Remnant Agents can be pickpocketed from or killed with no consequence to gain even more enchanted Remnant sets of armor and weapons. Finally head back to Purewater Run where Rakeed and Fijeh are waiting: ""You made it! I'm impressed. It was a gamble, but turned out well."" Good luck out there. I hope we meet again someday. ""Thank you. Here, this is for you. May the gods keep you."" More than deserving of some payment, I'd say. ""Thank you. Here, this is for you. May the gods keep you."" You will receive the gold you and Fijeh agreed on, and both Rakeed and Fijeh will vanish with the casting of Invisibility spells. This ends the quest. In addition to the rewards from the chest, you will now be able to smith the Remnant Armor, Boots, Gloves, Hood, Shield and Scimitars. These are the unenchanted versions of the Remnant Agent armor pieces and scimitars that you picked from the chest (all of which are enchanted except for the shield): they are to be found in the Steel menu, but require the Advanced Armors perk (on the left side of the Smithing tree) to forge, or to temper properly."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:J%27zargo%27s_Experiment","Obtain the scrolls from J'zargo. Use the scrolls to kill at least three undead enemies. Return to J'zargo with your results.","A Simple Request[edit] If you attended Tolfdir's lecture when you joined the College of Winterhold you may have run into a conceited Khajiit named J'zargo. J'zargo is ambitious and after your adventures under Saarthal, he tries to ingratiate himself and ask for your assistance: ""J'zargo has seen that Tolfdir likes you. You must be very skilled with magic, yes? J'zargo is working hard, but cannot do it alone. Can you help with this?"" It seems he has developed a new Destruction scroll that is especially effective against the undead. J'zargo will give you ten scrolls and send you on your way with instructions to report back on their efficacy. The Scrolls vs. The Undead[edit] Candidates for J'zargo's scrolls are draugr, skeletons, ghosts and zombies, any of which can be encountered in Skyrim's numerous barrows, tombs or ruins. Undead may also be encountered in The Midden, allowing convenient completion of this quest without travel if the quest has been accepted before the first venture down there. Otherwise, the Halls of the Dead in Whiterun and Solitude are also home to a sufficient number of easily accessible, weak undead. Just be sure to order your followers to wait outside, as they may kill the undead before you, or be harmed by the scrolls. To complete the quest, you will need to destroy three undead enemies while employing the scrolls. A quest marker will appear with each undead killed while under the effects of J'zargo's Flame Cloak. Undead do not need to be killed by the scrolls' damage; dying of other weapon or spell damage while under the effects of the scroll will satisfy the quest conditions. However, undead that are killed indirectly by the explosions of other undead do not count. If you use up all ten scrolls without killing three undead enemies, the quest will fail. A Slight Oversight[edit] The scrolls inflict ten points of fire damage per second for thirty seconds. Enemies on fire take extra damage. However, to accomplish this, J'zargo's cloak causes a massive explosion making the scrolls as harmful to you and your allies as to the undead, so ask your follower to stay behind when you test the scrolls, as the damage may kill them or turn them hostile. The scrolls can kill instantly if you are weakened with low reserves or health. Also, be wary of using a scroll when dealing with multiple undead enemies, as the multiplied effects of the ensuing explosions can be extremely damaging. A Job ""Well Done""[edit] Return to J'zargo after you have killed three undead to report the unfortunate side-effect. Knowing J'zargo and his ambitious intentions, you can ask him about the dubious nature of this experiment and your involvement in it. He will assure you that he meant you no harm, and was quite unsure of the effects the scrolls would have on the wielder. Upon finishing the quest you may keep the remaining scrolls and he will be accessible as a follower."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Jagged_Crown_(Imperial)","After you join the Imperial Legion, talk to Legate Rikke. Journey to Korvanjund. Meet up with Rikke and enter the ruins. Find your way into the tomb. Retrieve the Jagged Crown. Return to General Tullius.","Stormcloak Presence[edit] Legate Rikke is waiting for you After taking the oath to join the Imperial Legion, General Tullius will offer you another mission. After talking to Legate Rikke, she will ask you to meet her just west of the ruins of Korvanjund. When you arrive, she will be discussing the upcoming battle with a small group of soldiers.  As you approach, Hadvar will talk to you, explaining he is glad to be fighting with you, but that the Stormcloaks are not his biggest concern, hinting that the ruins don't want them to be there. The conversation ends and Legate Rikke will prompt the start of the quest. Move with the other soldiers up the hill and down into Korvanjund. Fight your way through several Stormcloaks and proceed up the stairs for another brief conversation with Legate Rikke, then open the doors to the Korvanjund Ruins. Inside the Ruins[edit] Once inside the Ruins, wait for Legate Rikke's signal to charge the Stormcloak guards standing at the top of the stairs. There are only four and they go down relatively easily. Continue down the stairs through a hall and into another room where you will find two more Stormcloaks up the stairs to the right. Follow Legate Rikke back to the entrance to a tunnel to the left of the entrance to the room. She will instruct you to find another way to proceed in order to avoid an ambush. Go back up the stairs and follow the catwalk counterclockwise around the room. Find a doorway that leads to a sky bridge above a room containing two Stormcloaks. Once you start fighting them, the Imperial soldiers will come running in to aid you. On the eastern end of this room there are more stairs, at the top of which is a chest and the Light Armor skill book Jornibret's Last Dance. The Imperial soldiers will push through to a tunnel on the left side of the room on the backside of the landing. Make your way down the tunnel and fight a few more Stormcloaks in a small room filled with burial urns. Legate Rikke and the Imperial soldiers will stop over a draugr and converse before moving on through the tunnels. Open the doors to Korvanjund Hall, where you will find another dead draugr along with a dead Stormcloak on the stairs. Take the stairs up and dispose of the one living Stormcloak before proceeding along the walkway and into another tunnel to the left. Find another lone Stormcloak to kill before reaching a fork in the tunnel. The tunnel to the left contains a swinging blades trap. Follow Legate Rikke straight down the tunnel into the Hall of Stories, which shows the history of the ancients who built Korvanjund. At the end of the hall you will find several dead Stormcloaks in front of a door. Pick up the Ebony Claw from the floor directly in front of the door. Like all claws, examining the symbols in your inventory will reveal the combination necessary to open the door (top to bottom: Fox—Moth—Dragon). Insert the claw into the door and proceed. Pass through a small gold door into a large room. To open the metal gate blocking your path, find the hall on the right side of the room and take the stairs leading to a walkway around the upper level of the room. Take the bridge across the room to an alcove with a chest in it; the handle that opens the gate is on the left side of the wall near the end of the bridge. Activating the lever will also trigger several draugr to emerge. Kill them to proceed through the now open gate. Note that If you take the dagger off the pedestal on the level above the gate, a secret passage will open, revealing a tunnel to a room containing an adept-trapped large chest. The Crown[edit] Finding the crown Open the door to Korvanjund Crypt and take the tunnel into a large room. As the Imperial soldiers spread out, approach the leveled draugr sitting hunched over on the throne. Hadvar will note the crown on his head and two leveled draugr will emerge from either side of the throne. Complete the quest by killing all of them and retrieving the Crown from the draugr's body.  Legate Rikke will then send you to deliver the Crown to General Tullius. Behind the throne there is a chest, and at the back of the room there is a Word Wall for a word of the shout Slow Time. Once you have the word, turn around to find a staircase to a tunnel that leads to Korvanjund Temple. Lift the bar off the door and open it, then turn right and head for the exit. Head back to Solitude and give the Jagged Crown to Tullius. He will immediately give you the next quest, Message to Whiterun. Reward[edit] No reward is given on this quest only a, ""Good work, soldier"" from General Tullius."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Jagged_Crown_(Stormcloaks)","After you join the Stormcloak Rebellion, talk to Galmar Stone-Fist. Journey to Korvanjund. Meet up with Galmar and enter the ruins. Find your way into the tomb. Retrieve the Jagged Crown. Return to Ulfric Stormcloak.","Imperial Presence[edit] After taking the oath to join the Stormcloaks, Galmar will offer you another mission. Ask him about it and he will tell you that he knows where the Jagged Crown is, and will ask you to meet with him and his men outside the ruins of Korvanjund. Head there and talk to Ralof, who will be glad to see you again. Galmar will tell you that there are already some Imperials patrolling the exterior of the ruins and ask if you're ready to take them on. Once you reply affirmatively, he will give a quick speech and then lead you to flank them from behind in a stealthy attack. After the Imperials are dead, Galmar and the Stormcloaks will enter the ruins after another short speech. Inside the Ruins[edit] Once inside, the men will all crouch behind a pillar that has fallen down. Galmar will tell you to attack on his signal, at which point you will charge in and eliminate all the Imperials you see. Galmar and the Stormcloaks will start moving as soon as the fight is over, leaving two soldiers behind to guard the entrance. The next room is rather large and empty. In it, Galmar will stop at the entrance to a tunnel and mention that this would be a prime spot for an ambush. He will then tell you to find another way through the tunnel, promising to aid you once he hears fighting. This is one of the few times you need not worry about staying with the rest of the Stormcloaks, allowing you time to loot the ruins. Head up to the second floor and search for stairs. Head up the stairs and follow the path; try to stay out of sight for as long as you can. When you are detected and attacked, Galmar and the other Stormcloaks will rush in to help you. On the eastern end of this room there are more stairs, at the top of which is the Light Armor skill book Jornibret's Last Dance. Once the Imperials are dead, Galmar will move to the exit of that room and wait for you to catch up. By the edge of the wall by the cliff there is a lever; pull it and get ready for a battle. When you enter the next room, a few Imperials will attack you. Once they are dead, the men will gather around a dead draugr while Galmar explains what it is. Follow the next tunnel to the door that leads to Korvanjund Halls. What Was That?[edit] The last of the Imperials Once in Korvanjund Halls, you will find a dead Imperial lying next to a dead draugr and a few living Imperials. As you move through, you will notice a few more dead draugr. To your left, there will be a swinging blade trap with a chest behind it. Once you get past the blades, there is a lever on the floor to the left of them that lets you turn them off. Once you go down the stairs, Galmar and the men will remark on the room you find yourself in, calling it ""The Hall of Stories"" and giving you some background on it. Proceed to the end, where there are two dead Imperials and a puzzle door. Near one of the dead Imperial's hands is the Ebony Claw, which has the proper combination of seals engraved on it. You have to examine it in your inventory to find the proper combination: Fox—Moth—Dragon. Galmar will say that he will examine the walls to find the way through and tell you to look for a way as well. Pick up the claw, put the seals in the right combination, and then open the door. Galmar will congratulate you, then go through the door and follow the tunnel to the next room. This room has a locked gate blocking your way, and Galmar will ask you to look for some way to open it. Look for a doorway with some stairs in it. At the top of the stairs, you will see a table to your right; there is a dagger on it. Moving the dagger causes a secret entrance to appear on the wall. In the revealed cave, there is a trapped chest. Back in the room, follow the catwalks past a wood plank bridge; there is another chest at the end of this passage. Turning around from the chest, as you leave the little alcove the chest is in, you will see a burial urn to your right. Just to the left and above the urn, there is a small handle on the rocky wall. Pulling the handle will open the gate, but also cause draugr to rise from their coffins on the lower floor, where the rest of the Stormcloaks are. The Crown[edit] Galmar fights for the crown Once the draugr are dead, the men will go through the door to Korvanjund Crypt. Follow them through and follow the tunnel. You will arrive in a room with multiple bookcases. There are two coffins next to a seemingly dead boss-level draugr sitting on a throne. You can either run up and attack the draugr before he has a chance to attack you, which will let other draugr out of their tombs, or wait for a soldier to go up to the unmoving draugr and mention the crown it wears, at which point the coffins will burst open, revealing hostile draugr. After they are dead, take the crown from the corpse of the boss draugr. Galmar will tell you to take it straight to Ulfric. If you talk to him again, he will mention that he will stick around for a while to find anything useful. You are no longer required to follow the Stormcloaks. Behind the throne, there is a locked chest, a Potion of Magicka, and at the back of the room there is a Word Wall for a word of the shout Slow Time. Once you have the word, turn around to find a staircase to a tunnel that leads to Korvanjund Temple. Lift the bar off the door and open it, then turn right and head for the exit. Once outside, after descending the second set of stairs, turn around and face the campfire. Beyond the campfire there is a master-locked gate, which is securing a room containing two coin purses and a chest with some nice loot. Head back to Windhelm and head into the Palace of Kings to give the Jagged Crown to Ulfric. He will immediately start the next quest, Message to Whiterun. Alternatively, if you decide that you really want to join the Imperial Legion, you can take the crown to General Tullius in Castle Dour in Solitude and ask to join the Legion. After giving him the crown, he will let you join and you will start the next quest in the Imperial questline."

Alternatively, you can skip the evidence gathering stage and instead discreetly eliminate the Visiting Advisor through either stealth or using a Frenzy spell while hidden.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Joining_the_Legion","Go to Solitude. Speak to General Tullius. Speak to Legate Rikke. Clear out bandits from Fort Hraggstad. Return to Legate Rikke. Take the Imperial Legion oath.","Imperial Introductions[edit] ""I'm telling you, Ulfric's planning an attack on Whiterun."" Anytime after escaping Helgen during Unbound, anyone you meet with ties with the Imperial Legion (like Hadvar) will encourage you to travel to Solitude to enlist. This will start the miscellaneous quest Imperial Introductions. In particoular, some of them will specify to talk to Legate Rikke at Castle Dour.  When you enter, you will witness her trying to convince an ill-informed General Tullius that Nords will follow their traditions, even in a time when loyalty is tested. Apparently, rebel leader Ulfric Stormcloak is preparing to attack Whiterun so the two strategists have their hands full. After the scene, if you try to speak to Legate Rikke, General Tullius will approach you. He will recall you from Helgen and, by any of your dialogue options, point you towards Legate Rikke for putting someone as resourceful as you to good use. Rikke will commend you for surviving the destruction of Helgen and tell you that she has arranged a small test of your skills before you're allowed to join the Legion. When asked which test she will explain: ""The kind that evaluates your usefulness during... duress. I'm sending you to clear out Fort Hraagstad. If you survive, you'll pass. If you die, then I'll have no further use for your corpse."" She will then explain that the Legion will set up a garrison at Fort Hraggstad but that the place has been overrun with bandits and needs to be cleared. She will not take no for an answer and will just angrily say: ""What's the matter, soldier? I gave you an order. I want that fort, and I want it now. Move it!"". This will complete the miscellanous quest Imperial Introductions and start Joining the Legion. If you have already visited Fort Hraggstad and cleared it, she will be quite surprised: ""Is that so? I was right about you."". This will complete Imperial Introductions and start Joining the Legion with the first stages completed. Joining the Legion[edit] Prove Your Usefulness[edit] The fort is located near the Thalmor Embassy, west of Solitude in the snowy terrain past Wolfskull Cave. Once there, a number of bandits will attack you on sight. The fort has archers, atop towers, so approach with caution. Once the exterior area is clear, locate the entrance to the fort and enter. It consists of two interior zones: the main zone and the prison, both of them accessible from separate entrances in the courtyard. In the prison, two bandits await you in the first room, with another guarding the area downstairs. In the main zone, two bandits and their chief will ambush you upon entering. You can find a copy of the Archery skill book, The Gold Ribbon of Merit upstairs. When all is said and done return to Legate Rikke in Solitude. The Oath[edit] ""Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"" Upon your next enter in the castle, Legate Rikke and Tullius will once again be debating, this time about the Jagged Crown. Tullius will once again show a lack of respect for Nordic tradition. After the scene, Rikke will approach you and will be pleased to see your success, complimenting you on a job well done: ""Welcome back, soldier. I'm glad you made it in one piece. I'll send men to garrison the fort right away. You did well. I'm impressed. But before we go any further, it's time for you to officially join the Legion."". General Tullius will then approach you to take the oath binding you to the service of the emperor and the Legion. Repeat the oath after him: ""Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor, Titus Mede II..."" ""...and unwavering obedience to the officers of his great Empire."" ""May those above judge me, and those below take me, if I fail in my duty."" ""Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"" Tullius will then welcome you to the Legion and send you to the castle's blacksmith, Beirand, starting the miscellaneous quest Get Outfitted, who will provide you with a set of Imperial armor. You may choose heavy, medium, or light Imperial armor. Once Tullius has sent you towards Beirand the quest ends and the next one starts, your first assignment for the Empire as an Auxiliary of the Imperial Legion, The Jagged Crown.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Kagrumez_Gauntlet","Acquire two Kagrumez Resonance Gems. Go to Kagrumez. Kill the reavers inside. Loot the reaver leader and find the other two gems. Use gems in pedestal to create three different patterns. Defeat the waves of enemies.","Acquiring Resonance Gems[edit] A total of five Kagrumez's Resonance Gems can be found in various locations.  You only need four, and two of them are located within Kagrumez itself, carried by the leader of the reavers there.  One more can be found in a chamber in the upper northeast corner of Nchardak aqueduct (picture).  It is small and lying out in the open so beware of sending it flying when fighting the ballista guarding it. A second can be found near the Visage of Mzund in Fahlbtharz (pictured). A third is sold by Revus Sarvani, who is attending the silt strider just west of Tel Mithryn. If he dies, then it can be found on his body, unless his body has been removed; it may also be pickpocketed from him. Once you have found two of the three found outside of Kagrumez, you can go and get the remaining ones there. The First Pattern[edit] When you enter the main chamber, the first thing you'll probably see after dealing with the reavers there is a console with a strange pattern and nine holes, into which you can place the gems.  To your left as you face the console, there is a locked door with a similar pattern on it, and blue dots showing you where to place the gems.  Copy the pattern, and gates will trap you while the room around you undergoes some changes.  When they come back down, you'll be facing a number of Dwarven automatons.  Kill them all, and then proceed through the now-open gate.  Inside, you'll find a chamber with a lever in front of it.  Pulling the lever opens the chamber to reveal a friendly Steadfast Dwarven Spider.  If you talk to the spider, you can tell it to follow you and it will help you fight.  This follower acts as a pet, so you cannot have it along with a dog or other pet, and does not count as a summon, so you can still have one (or two with the Twin Souls perk) in addition to the spider. The Second Pattern[edit] In this room, you'll also see another door with a pattern on it, this one requiring three gems.  Go back to the main room and copy the pattern.  Again the gates will rise as the room reorganizes, and when they come back down, you'll be facing more automatons, as well as an assortment of fire-based traps filling the room.  Kill them all again, and the traps will deactivate, and you can then go through the second door.  This room contains a similar chamber, this one containing a Steadfast Dwarven Sphere.  Like the spider, it can be made into a follower, and also counts as a pet, so you can't have the spider and sphere at the same time, or either of them along with a dog or other pet. The Third Pattern[edit] Again, you'll find another door, this one with a pattern requiring four gems.  Return to the main chamber and copy the pattern, and this time when the room reorganizes itself, there will be shallow water over most of the room, with several raised platforms above the surface.  The water is electrified, and will deal Shock Damage if you step in it, so either jump to the platforms, use Whirlwind Sprint, or just run through very quickly to avoid taking too much damage.  When you've killed the last round of automatons, go back through the last door and you'll be in a room with an assortment of treasures, including the Dwarven Black Bow of Fate.  A passage leads from here to the balcony overlooking the main chamber, where you can drop down and proceed to the exit."

However if you have advanced far enough in the civil war quest line (beyond the Battle for Whiterun), it is garrisoned by soldiers of whichever faction controls Whiterun - your faction, that is, making the assassination much easier. Either way, Agnis is easily found inside the keep and, having only a dagger and some modest clothing for protection, is equally easy to kill.

During the day he works at his stall in the market, and at night he retires to The Drunken Huntsman, which is run by his brother, to sleep. Your best bet to take him out without a bounty is to either shoot him during the day from a remote spot such as Jorrvaskr, or to sneak into his bedroom at night and slit his throat. However, both are very difficult to do without incurring a bounty, so plan for this. As third option; when Anoriath is working his stall, go straight behind him and climb the rock until you reach the walls corner.

Lurbuk is not known to ever leave the Moorside Inn and can easily be picked off with an arrow when he isn't performing. The difficulty lies in the fact that whatever you tell him, he will never turn hostile and attack, which would potentially increase the chances of earning a bounty, no matter what you say to him. If you are having difficulty killing Lurbuk in the common room, you can wait until he either sits in the corner of his room or goes to sleep late at night. There should be no one else in the room, so a single sneak attack should be enough to eliminate him silently. It is also possible to wait until he's sitting in the common room, and then sneak into the room across from him, facing his back. From this position it can be safe to shoot him with an arrow, and as long as the arrow used can take him out with one blow, it will still be a stealthy kill. You can also rent a bed from the innkeeper. When she leaves to show you to your room, you can kill Lurbuk without her witnessing the kill. A creative, albeit risky, way to get the job done is to cast a Frenzy spell on him. Provided that you are not seen or heard, the effect will cause everyone in the inn to see Lurbuk as a hostile, attacking and killing him for you. Another way to kill him is similar to the bow and arrow method above. Sneak into the room across from him and wait until you are hidden. Once hidden, release an offensive Shout (fire breath, frost breath, etc.) towards Lurbuk. This should do the trick since one Shout should be sufficient in killing him. Note: invisibility helps with sneaking and hiding in the room across from Lurbuk. Like most assassination targets, you may choose to have a conversation with Lurbuk before killing him: Topic  Dialogue   ""Someone hired the Dark Brotherhood to kill you, Lurbuk."" ""Ha!

Report back to Nazir to collect your reward.","Get the Contract[edit] Right after your initiation into the Dark Brotherhood, guild leader Astrid will confess that no ""real"" jobs are available at the moment and that you should talk to Nazir for smaller contract work. Nazir will give three targets to you at the same time, so you are free to pick what order you do them in. On Narfi, he will comment that ""He's a hapless beggar living in some ruins just outside the village of Ivarstead. Easy even for you."" Kill a Beggar[edit] Make your way to Ivarstead, the small settlement at the foot of the Throat of the World, and locate Narfi. Due to the roaming creek separating Narfi's worn-out house from the rest of Ivarstead, there are no watchful eyes from the Ivarstead guards, and as such, you can kill him in any manner you want. The easiest method is to kill him in his sleep; he goes to bed at 4am, so take advantage of the darkness and sneak into the cabin right after that time and dispose of the beggar. Note that the sawmill across the lake gets busy right after 7am, so don't wait too long. If you speak to Narfi before you kill him, you are given three dialogue options; you may only pick one as the conversation ends and you can't speak to him again. Topic  Dialogue   (Remain silent) ""Do... do you want something? Look, if you ain't gonna talk, or spare no coin, just go away...""   ""Your pathetic existence has come to an end, Narfi."" ""Oh... Oh no... Please, please... I ain't never harmed no one... Old Narfi just wants to be left alone...""   ""Beg! Beg for your miserable life!"" ""No! Oh, by the gods, please no!"" Narfi won't defend himself as a result of any of these dialogue options, so if you are seen killing him, you cannot avoid a bounty. Reward[edit] Once Narfi is dead, travel back to the sanctuary and receive your reward of leveled gold from Nazir, who will also comment, ""Congratulations. You slaughtered an emaciated beggar in cold blood. You are truly an opponent to be feared."" Levels Reward   1–9 250   10–19 400   20–29 500   30–39 600   40+ 750"

Note that two of the Red Wave's crew members are considered essential and thus cannot be killed and will continue fighting a little after you ""defeat"" them, which also gives you bounty. Therefore, it is best to avoid any combat with the crew. You may have the following conversation with Safia: Topic  Dialogue   ""I represent the Dark..."" ""The Dark Brotherhood? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Kindred_Judgment","Speak to Serana. Confront Harkon with Auriel's Bow. Slay Harkon.","Vampire Side: After obtaining Auriel's Bow, Serana tells you that it is time to confront her father. Head back to Volkihar Keep. Once inside, it is not possible to initiate dialogue with any of the other vampires, who will instead direct you to Lord Harkon. He can be found upstairs in the Volkihar Cathedral, where he awaits you and Serana in his Vampire Lord form. When you confront Lord Harkon, he will begin by insulting you for your disloyalty towards him. When Serana tells him that she will not let herself be sacrificed and that you are on her side, Lord Harkon will give recognition to your persuasive abilities by saying that ""This dragon has fangs"". He makes a final insult to Valerica, and chides Serana for becoming more like her mother. At this point, Lord Harkon will demand that you give him Auriel's Bow. If you refuse to give it to him, he will attack you. Likewise, if you give him the bow, he will betray you and attack. Because both dialogue options end in him attacking you, it is not recommended to give him Auriel's Bow, as it can be very useful during the battle. Dawnguard Side: The Dawnguard side of this quest is much like the Vampire side, except that after acquiring the bow, Serana will tell you to head back to Isran. Once at Fort Dawnguard, talk to Isran, who will gather the rest of the Dawnguard. If you chose to become a vampire in order to gain access to the Soul Cairn, Isran will refuse to speak with you until you have been cured. After a short speech, everyone will head out to Castle Volkihar. Once you arrive there, the Dawnguard, including one armored troll, will start the attack on the castle, beginning with four vampires (Rargal Thrallmaster, Modhna, Namasur, and Stalf), , a few Gargoyles and one Death hound who defend the outdoor approach to the castle. When they have been defeated, you will then lead the charge into Castle Volkihar, fighting the remaining vampires (Hestla, Salonia Caelia, Fura Bloodmouth, Orthjolf, Vingalmo, Garan Marethi, Ronthil, and Feran Sadri) and Death Hound. After all the vampires have been killed, follow Isran to a gated off doorway with a pull chain to the right of it. Pull it to raise the portcullis, then head up the steps and through the doors into the Volkihar Cathedral, where you will find Lord Harkon. Alternatively, you can ignore the vampires inside the castle and go directly to the cathedral. The conversation with Lord Harkon on the Dawnguard side is somewhat different than the conversation on the Vampire side, mainly in the tone of the conversation and in Lord Harkon's dialogue with the player. Instead of insulting the player for their lack of loyalty, Lord Harkon will admit that it was only a matter of time before Serana would one day return with hatred in her heart. He then questions the player's allegiance to Serana by asking if she and Valerica are next after dealing with him. No matter what dialogue options you choose, Lord Harkon will eventually demand that you give him Auriel's Bow, where you are faced with the same choice. Giving him Auriel's Bow is not recommended for the same reasons listed above. It might be a good idea to time your assault against Castle Volkihar so that it occurs during the day so you can take advantage of Sunhallowed Arrows used on the sun to help take down the vampires who attack outside. To make sure the assault takes place during the day, you can travel to a nearby location (example: Icewater Jetty), wait until morning (if you arrive there at night), and continue to the castle from there. If you have the Clear Skies shout, you can use it to clear away the clouds and snow to make the vampires who attack outside easier to eliminate. Fighting Lord Harkon[edit] ""No... Serana... your own father...."" Fighting Lord Harkon is the same regardless of whether you are a vampire or a member of the Dawnguard. If you are not prepared, Lord Harkon can be a difficult opponent to defeat. If you gave him Auriel's Bow, then you will be at a slight disadvantage. As soon as he exits dialogue with you, Lord Harkon will immediately summon skeletons and gargoyles to kill you, and will continue to do so throughout the fight. However, Serana is quite capable of handling them on her own, which leaves you to focus solely on Lord Harkon. Lord Harkon will continuously move throughout the room, firing Vampiric Drain at you and will frequently turn into a swarm of bats. As you deplete his health, Lord Harkon will turn into a swarm of bats and will materialize at the altar. As he hovers over the altar, he will create an impregnable shield of Blood Magic until he regains his health. If you have Auriel's Bow, equip it and fire at the shield, which will destroy it. Try not to waste Sunhallowed arrows during this fight, as Lord Harkon will do this repeatedly, and any arrow fired from Auriel's Bow will penetrate the shield. When his health is low, he will begin to frequently turn into mist; simply follow him until he re-materializes. Once the killing blow is struck, Lord Harkon will turn into a swarm of bats and materialize by the altar one final time, where he makes a final cry to his daughter's betrayal, and then melts into a pile of red ash. Alternatively, at the beginning of the battle, you will be free to move around when Lord Harkon is speaking to Serana, and you can even slay him outright with high enough sneak-attack damage. Again, Lord Harkon will turn materialize by the altar one final time, where he makes a final cry to his daughter's betrayal, and then melts into a pile of red ash. After the battle is over, Garan Marethi (if you are a vampire) or Isran (if you are a member of the Dawnguard) will enter the room, and will commend you for defeating Lord Harkon. He will then explain that there will be a new beginning for the Volkihar vampires or the Dawnguard, thus completing the Dawnguard questline. Serana will tell you that she will stay at Castle Volkihar or Fort Dawnguard, but will accompany you on your travels should you ask her. Aftermath[edit] While you do not corrupt Auriel's Bow bringing it to its full potential, you can still use it to block out the sun once per day with Bloodcursed Elven Arrows. While the sun is blocked out, you will not suffer from any of the penalties of sun damage during the day. After one day, the sun will return and you will need to shoot it again. Bloodcursed arrows are necessary for this function. A dialogue option with Serana will open up that allows you to turn Elven arrows into Bloodcursed arrows. The blacksmith associated with your chosen faction will stock an additional 200 Elven arrows, which you can convert into Sunhallowed or Bloodcursed arrows. Certain Volkihar Clan or Dawnguard side quests will become available. If you sided with the vampires, Garan Marethi will ask you if you want him to restore the entrance to the courtyard the next time you talk to him. The repair is free, and will be complete the next time you enter the keep. On the Dawnguard side, you can ask Serana to transform you into a Vampire Lord or convince her to give up her vampirism. On Lord Harkon's body you will find one of the sets of Vampire Royal Armor and Harkon's Sword, a unique katana. If you gave him Auriel's Bow, you can retrieve it from there as well. If you return to the Soul Cairn, Valerica will be amazed at Harkon's defeat and return to Castle Volkihar. She will return to her lab, where she will restock it, and offer potions and ingredients for free. She will also give you advice on how to survive if you return the Soul Cairn. The garden in the courtyard will be upgraded as well. Unfortunately, she won't provide blood for Bloodcursed Elven Arrows. Random encounters with members from the opposing faction in hold capitals and the wilderness will be less frequent. Random vampire attacks on settlements will only occur during an eclipse. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: Kindred JudgementDG (40 points/Silver)"

Pavo and his fellow miner Gat gro-Shargakh are the only survivors of a Forsworn invasion of Kolskeggr Mine. Skaggi is visibly upset by this news; he gives the two survivors permission to stay at Left Hand Mine, and vows to send word to the Jarl. If you speak with Skaggi, he expresses his concern over the increasing Forsworn threat and the timeliness of a response from the Jarl. If you agree to clear out the mine, he will be grateful, but skeptical about your ability to survive. Speaking with Pavo will also initiate the quest and he will also offer the same sentiments about the Jarl's response and your success in the mine. The quest may not start and dialogue options may not be available if The Forsworn Conspiracy is not completed and your bounty in Markarth is high.

Visit the culprit's home and obtain evidence of a plot against the town. Report your findings to the jarl and be tasked with eliminating the threat. Lead a group of townspeople in the defense of Morthal.","This Fire Burns[edit] Just about everyone around town will be gossiping about Hroggar's house that recently burned down, with his wife and daughter inside. Since Hroggar shacked up with Alva the very next day, many townspeople suspect foul play. Once you've found the charred ruins of the house, next to Highmoon Hall, you can take your inquiry straight to the jarl, who will ask for your help in this matter: to sift through the ashes others are afraid to touch. Alternatively, after discovering the house, but before seeing the jarl, a guard will approach you, asking for help, and initiating the quest. Similarly, visiting Jonna at Moorside Inn before visiting the jarl will also set you on your way. In any case, another search of the burned house will rouse the ghost of Helgi, Hroggar's daughter. She describes dying in the fire. Even though she is a ghost, she is still a little girl. Agree to play hide-and-seek after dark with her, and in return she will reveal who set the fire. She also tells you that the game will begin at nighttime, so the other player in the game can join you. When you ask about this other player, Helgi becomes fearful, saying the other is close and may hear her. Then, she challenges you ""If you can find me first, I can tell you"", and promptly disappears. Hide and Seek with a Ghost[edit] At this point, though it is not indicated with a quest marker, you have the option of going to the jarl to tell her you saw the ghost of Helgi. If you tell Jonna first about the spirit, she will direct you to the jarl to tell your tale. Speaking to the jarl will give you some insight into the game and direct you to the grave where Helgi was buried. You can also tell Hroggar that you saw Helgi's ghost and he will respond with chilling indifference. You will receive a quest marker indicating where to ""find Helgi in the dark"". Wait until nightfall to find Helgi ""hiding"" in her grave in a small plot behind the house. It's a short distance away, up and to the right, marked with cairns. Someone else will also be there, prepared to fight once they see you. I've Been Expecting You...[edit] Laelette attacks When you arrive, Thonnir's missing wife Laelette is already there. Defeat Laelette and activate Helgi's spirit. She will be pleased that you won the game and found her before Laelette. She will then tell you the heart-wrenching story of how an unwilling Laelette was forced to burn the house. Laelette, in an effort to save the child, attempted to turn her into a vampire, but Helgi was too far gone from the fire and perished. She will then tell you that she is tired and wants to sleep. Meanwhile, Laelette's husband, Thonnir, arrives at Helgi's grave, distraught at finding Laelette dead. Speak to Thonnir and he will tell you that he thought Laelette had left him to join the resistance. Ask him if there was anything strange going on before she left and he tells you that his wife had begun spending a lot of time with Alva, and was supposed to have met her on the night she disappeared. Alva claimed that Laelette never showed up. Here you inform the grieving husband your deductions about what really went on that night the women were to have met. Thonnir is incensed at the idea that Alva may be a vampire; he refuses to believe you and reiterates that you have no proof of Alva's undead status. A new quest directive invites you to investigate Alva. The Detective[edit] Break into Alva's house across town, where Hroggar is now living as well. Hroggar will be immediately hostile if he is in the house when you arrive. If you break in during the day, Hroggar will not be there, though Alva will be—sleeping in her coffin. If you break in at night, Alva will most likely be outside of the house, and the coffin will be empty but for her journal. Whichever time of day you break in, make your way into the basement to discover Alva's coffin and her journal. If Alva is in her coffin when you visit, you will need to deal with her, but her demise is not necessary to advance the quest. Read the journal to discover how all the events unfolded, including how she was turned by the master vampire Movarth, the plot to enslave the townspeople of Morthal for their blood, and the beginnings of your investigation. Take Alva's journal back to Highmoon Hall and the jarl will reward you with a small sum of leveled gold. She then asks one more favor: travel to Movarth's Lair and eliminate the threat. She has gathered a small group of townspeople, led by Thonnir, to travel with you. To Movarth's Lair[edit] The agitated mob who, as it turns out, is not 100% prepared to fight a centuries-old master vampire Thonnir, enraged by the events that took his wife's life, leads the charge whether you're ready or not. Once the party arrives at the lair, however, everyone but Thonnir flees in terror. Thonnir offers you a choice of whether he accompanies you or not. He's essential, so he won't die, but he can't hold his own well, and you don't require his assistance to advance the quest. Whatever you choose, enter the one-zone lair and dispatch the vampire thralls and Movarth. Movarth is a vampire boss that can regenerate health, and is generally pretty tough. If you didn't take care of Alva in her own house, she will be in the lair, and possibly aid you in killing the other vampires. You can then kill her yourself if you'd like, though this may result in a bounty if Thonnir sees you do it (this sometimes can occur even if he's outside). Return to the Jarl of Morthal[edit] As you leave the lair, Helgi's ghost will appear and thank you for avenging her mother's death. Return to Morthal and the jarl will reward you with a leveled amount of gold and the jarl's increased disposition towards you. Reward[edit] First payout:    Levels Reward   1–9 250   10–19 400   20–29 500   30–39 600   40+ 750    Second payout:    Levels Reward   1–9 400   10–19 600   20–29 800   30–39 1,000   40+ 1,200 If you have the Hearthfire add-on installed, you'll also be able to purchase the deed to Windstad Manor following the completion of this quest."

On the bar top is a Lost Caravan Guard's Note, which can be freely taken. Reading this note will reveal that a highly secretive smuggling operation had been organized to transport some unknown cargo through Skyrim, using the refugees fleeing Morrowind as cover. Several decoy caravans were employed to transport this cargo, each with a code name based on the Great Houses of Morrowind. The author of this letter was part of the Telvanni caravan, and was reportedly carrying the cargo towards the Nightgate Inn. The destroyed remains of this caravan are half-buried in snow along the road between Windhelm and the inn, just north of the entrance to Bronze Water Cave. Several destroyed Dwarven automatons surround the carriage, along with the skeletons of the unfortunate caravaneers. Unfortunately, the elusive cargo is nowhere to be found, although there is a Carriage Driver's Note in an ""Old Caravan Chest"" at the wreckage. The author of this note complains of attacks from Dwarven automatons as well as ""singing"" coming from the cargo. It also reveals that the items were handed off to the Sadras caravan, which was heading for Whiterun. (If Saints and SeducersCC is also installed, the first caravan is located right next to Svarig's Dark Seducer camp and can be discovered before starting this quest. Reading the Carriage Driver's Note without going to the cornerclub will start the quest and direct you to the next caravan with no context.) The next ruined caravan is just off the road east of Loreius Farm. You will be greeted by a familiar scene of Dwarven machines and skeletal corpses. One such skeleton can be found holding the Seedy Guard's Note, which reveals that the cargo had been handed over to the Indoril caravan and that its captain was planning to stop by the Hall of the Dead in Whiterun. Be sure to loot the nearby Old Caravan Chest for valuables, then make your way to Whiterun. The Plot Thickens[edit] You will need to enter the Whiterun Catacombs once you arrive at the Hall of the Dead. This area is infested with low level undead skeletons. Down the first set of stairs, you will find the Caravan Captain's Note atop a low-lying table. According to the note, the surviving caravans took a detour towards Falkreath to avoid any further Dwemer attacks. You will find their remains at a ruined campsite in the woods northwest of Peak's Shade Tower. One of the skeletons is in fact the body of Velyne, a member of the Hlaalu caravan and seemingly one of the masterminds behind this venture. Velyne's Letter at last reveals that the secretive cargo is actually Sunder and Wraithguard, and that the Dwemer automaton attacks are the result of a fail-safe system implemented by Kagrenac to prevent his Tools from ever leaving Morrowind. The Dwemer created a Tamriel-wide network of drones which would track down and retrieve the Tools if they were taken out of Morrowind, and would then deposit them in a vault until a Tonal Architect could come and retrieve them. Seeking to put a stop to the attacks, some of the caravan captains betrayed their employers and handed Sunder and Wraithguard over to the drones. Velyne learned of this, and managed to track the items to a vault located in Sightless Pit. She obtained a Attunement Crystal to unseal this vault, but evidently died before an expedition could ever be organized. Take the crystal from her skeleton and be sure to loot the Old Caravan Chest before you leave. Use the Attunement Crystal to unlock the Sightless Vault Steam will need to be restored to both valve systems The Tools Hidden Depository[edit] Sightless Pit is a Falmer-infested dungeon in the snowy wastes southwest of Winterhold. Unlike most dungeons in the game, the entrance to Sightless Pit is one-way, meaning you will need to fight your way through the entire complex in order to escape. See the dungeon walkthrough for more information. Your goal is to reach the final zone, Abandoned Cave. A new door has been added by this Creation, to the right of the lift as you enter the zone. Place the Attunement Crystal on the Dwarven Pedestal to unseal the entrance to the Sightless Vault. This is a new area added by the Creation and consists of a large central room with two side areas. Sunder and Wraithguard are locked behind gates in the center of the room and cannot be reached. To begin unlocking the gates, you must first activate a Vault Release Valve at the back of the room. You must then solve two steam valve puzzles in the two side rooms, which will involve activating each valve several times until the steam travels in the right direction. Your goal is to direct the steam in the direction of the next valve, until you reach the end of the piping and your journal updates. You will need to fight two Dwarven Spiders and two Dwarven Spheres respectively after you solve each room. With this done, the door near the original Vault Release Valve will open and an extremely powerful ebony-colored Dwarven Centurion named the Messenger will emerge. Once you defeat this final guardian, the gates will swing open and Sunder and Wraithguard are yours to claim. On its own, Sunder does 5 points of frost, fire, and shock damage each and 15 points of damage to stamina and magicka. With Wraithguard equipped, Sunder becomes a powerful weapon, although unlike its initial appearance in Morrowind it will not kill you if you equip the weapon without wearing Wraithguard. Wraithguard also provides 10% resistance to shock, fire, frost, magic, disease, and poison when worn. If you've already completed Arniel's Endeavor, you will have come into possession of Keening, another of Kagrenac's Tools. Keening is also empowered if wielded while Wraithguard is equipped, and it can be dual wielded along with Sunder. Before you depart, make sure you loot the chest in the room where the Messenger emerged from."

Bring the Totem Bone to the caged Bone Wolf nearby to complete the quest.","An undead pet Solitude Calls for Aid[edit] Once The Wolf Queen Awakened has been completed, a courier will give you a letter from Bolgeir Bearclaw. After reading the note, you will be directed to a rocky overhang located along the coast northwest of Folgunthur, just across the bay from the Solitude docks. A hostile necromancer has set up camp underneath the outcrop. His camp is guarded by two hostile thrall wolves and werewolf pelts can be found scattered all over. The necromancer will also likely resurrect the nearby dead wolf so be prepared to face multiple enemies. Once you have defeated the hostiles, search the necromancer to obtain his journal, along with a key and a bloody Totem Bone. The key can be used to unlock the nearby cage which contains a non-hostile Bone Wolf. The necromancer had not yet completed the ritual to bind the wolf to his will and it will be quite happy to have its bone back. The quest will then conclude and you can ask the Bone Wolf to follow you. It serves as a pet, meaning it will not fight enemies but can be used to carry items. While following you, the Bone Wolf will grant you a perk buffing the damage you do to undead enemies. It can also be told to wait at a city, wait at its current location (either temporarily or permanently), or wait at your house."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Liar%27s_Retreat_(quest)","Note: This quest does not appear in your journal. Investigate what happened at Liar's Retreat. Discover the Falmer nest. Find Rahd and claim his Longhammer. Take the blame for the Falmer attack.","A Falmer Invasion[edit] This party is over Liar's Retreat is a remote bandit cave in the mountains between Karthwasten and Cliffside Retreat, a long distance southwest from Solitude. The peaceful exterior resembles a normal bandit hideout, but as you enter you will quickly realize that the human inhabitants got more than they bargained for when they moved in. From a small pedestal near the entrance door, you will witness several intruding  Falmer  battling the bandits, and emerging victorious. After passing over the bloodbath, you'll find more dead bandits everywhere, suggesting that you might best prepare yourself for a huge wave of attacking Falmer as you slowly crawl down to a homemade tavern, now soaked in blood. Fight all the Falmer and take a look around; the deceased bartender lies behind the bar, wearing the semi-rare tavern clothes, and a slaughtered bandit bard poignantly clutches his lute. Take the northwestern exit and start investigating the private chambers; a cowardly bandit has barricaded the southernmost room and guards some minor loot there from within. The next blood-soaked room contains more dead bodies, while the third room holds a locked chest containing more minor loot. Head east and you will find yourself in the kitchen behind the bar, where plenty of ingredients and potions can be gathered. Backtrack a bit and notice the hole in the wall leading into a Falmer den—the Falmer seemingly broke through at this point to ambush the bandits. Claim the Longhammer[edit] A sacrifice for the reaper Head into the bluish-tinted tunnel and step over yet another dead bandit. Before long, cobwebs will cover all the walls and a frostbite spider will attack, along with another Falmer. Proceed through the tunnels until you reach a lit torch on the ground. As you approach the next chamber, a few Falmer guarding some imprisoned bandits will attack. In the panic, the bandits will escape from the pens, kill their captors, and then turn on you. Proceed through the northern tunnel and follow it as it bends. You will arrive in a chamber filled with Dwemer architecture and machinery, now used for human sacrifices by the Falmer. You will face a chaurus reaper and two Falmer enemies. After the battle, examine the area for some minor treasure, then head to the sacrificial altar in the middle where you will find Rahd, a dead Breton, lying next to The Longhammer, one of the most powerful unique weapons in the game. Claim it and leave the same way you came. As you travel back through Liar's Retreat, more frostbite spiders will spawn in the spider nest, so be wary. When you return to the tavern area just before the entrance, a group of bandits will enter from outside to be shocked at the grisly scene. The bandit chief will call out to the fallen Rahd with the words: ""Hey, Longhammer, set us up with a round of... what in Oblivion happened in here?"" When the bandits discover you, they will assume you were responsible for the massacre, and attack immediately.  Finish up this final fight, and escape with your prize."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Liberation_of_Skyrim","Liberate each of Skyrim's Holds (depending upon your choices during Season Unending): Liberate Falkreath. Liberate The Reach. Liberate Hjaalmarch. Liberate The Pale. Liberate Winterhold. Liberate The Rift. Liberate Haafingar.","Quest Options[edit] This quest governs the overall progress of the Civil War for the Stormcloaks.  It is completed by doing a series of other quests that are assigned to you as the Liberation of Skyrim progresses. The overall goal of the quest is to conquer each hold of Skyrim, one at a time, by taking control of the military fort for each hold.  The holds to be conquered are altered by negotiations during Season Unending, and therefore there are many possible ways to complete this quest. Without doing Season Unending, only the Imperial-controlled holds in the following table need to be conquered. The Stormcloak-controlled holds only need to be conquered if given to the Imperials during Season Unending. The Imperial-controlled holds will not need to be conquered if taken from the Imperials during Season Unending. Also, if you do Season Unending, then this quest will be put on hold until you have completed the main quest. After you defeat Alduin, then you will be able to continue with this quest. Hold Initial Allegiance Stormcloak Camp Quests   Eastmarch  Stormcloaks None  Always Stormcloak-controlled (if you have joined the Stormcloaks)   Whiterun Hold Neutral Whiterun Stormcloak Camp  Always becomes Stormcloak-controlled during the previous quest, Battle for Whiterun   Falkreath Hold  Imperial[1] Falkreath Stormcloak Camp  Rescue from Fort Neugrad   The Reach  Imperial [1] Reach Stormcloak Camp  Compelling Tribute The Battle for Fort Sungard   Hjaalmarch  Imperial [1] Hjaalmarch Stormcloak Camp  A False Front The Battle for Fort Snowhawk   The Pale  Stormcloaks [1] Pale Stormcloak Camp  The Battle for Fort Dunstad   Winterhold  Stormcloaks [1] Winterhold Stormcloak Camp  The Battle for Fort Kastav   The Rift  Stormcloaks [1] Rift Stormcloak Camp  The Battle for Fort Greenwall   Haafingar  Imperial Haafingar Stormcloak Camp  Haafingar is always the final hold that needs to be conquered. The Battle for Fort Hraggstad Battle for Solitude ^1These holds can change sides during Season Unending. One final complication is that when you complete the quest Dragonslayer during the Main Quest, any hold (other than Haafingar) that you have previously been tasked with liberating is immediately transferred to Stormcloak control.  All remaining quests for that hold are skipped, and you need to return to Windhelm to receive the next assignment from Ulfric. General Information[edit] In order to receive the next hold that needs to be liberated, you always start by talking to Ulfric at the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm.  Ulfric will acknowledge any progress you have made so far, including possibly giving you a new title and/or reward.  He will then tell you which hold needs to be conquered next, along with some explanation for why that hold is the next priority. The next step is to travel to the Stormcloak Camp located in the targeted hold.  The location of the camp has been added to your map, but normally it is an undiscovered location, meaning that you cannot fast travel to the camp.  Once in the camp, you need to find Galmar Stone-Fist, who is found in the main tent of the camp, poring over an updated map of the war's progress.  Selecting the topic ""Reporting in"" causes Galmar to assign you a specific quest that needs to be completed. In almost all cases, one required quest is ""The Battle for <Alias=Fort>"".  The underlying quest for this battle is always the same, but is simply radiantly assigned to the military fort protecting the appropriate hold.  In each case, you need to travel to the fort and help kill all Imperial soldiers present in the fort; your screen will update regularly with the fraction of soldiers who still need to be killed. Falkreath[edit] Falkreath Hold does not need to be liberated if it was given to the Stormcloaks during Season Unending Your first assignment in the Liberation of Skyrim is normally to liberate Falkreath Hold.  In addition to telling you have free rein to kill Imperials as you see fit, Ulfric tells you to report to Galmar Stone-Fist at the hidden Stormcloak camp. The only quest that needs to be completed in Falkreath Hold is Rescue from Fort Neugrad. The Reach[edit] The Reach does not need to be liberated if it was given to the Stormcloaks during Season Unending After you complete Rescue from Fort Neugrad, your journal will tell you to return to Ulfric, so head back to Windhelm and enter the Palace of the Kings. Talk to Ulfric and he will congratulate you, and give you the title ""Bone Breaker"" and a leveled weapon as well as the permission to buy a house in Windhelm. He will then tell you to head to the Stormcloaks camp in the reach. Go to the camp, and enter the large tent and report in to Galmar, he says that the steward in Markarth is secretly a Talos worshipper and you might be able to find some proof and then ""convince"" him to help the Stormcloaks. This starts the Compelling Tribute quest. After completing Compelling Tribute, head back to Galmar, who will thank you and give you some leveled gold. Then report in to him and he will tell you that you are going to Fort Sungard, to take over it, he will tell you to go and meet the men preparing for the attack. This will start the next quest The Battle for Fort Sungard. Hjaalmarch[edit] Hjaalmarch does not need to be liberated if it was given to the Stormcloaks during Season Unending After completing The Battle for Fort Sungard, return to Ulfric in Windhelm and speak to him. Ulfric thanks you for liberating the reach, and then gives you your new title of ""Snow-Hammer"" (unless you completed Season Unending) and a leveled shield. He then tells you to go to the Hjaalmarch Stormcloak Camp. Head to the camp and report in to Galmar as usual, he will tell you that you have to deliver some false orders to the imperial legate in Morthal, but first you will have to get some orders to be forged. He says the inns at Rorikstead and Dragon Bridge are frequent stops for imperial couriers. This starts the next quest A False Front. After Completing A False Front, return to Galmar at the Hjaalmarch camp and report in. He will congratulate you give you some leveled gold, he will then tell you to meet the men preparing to attack Fort Snowhawk and to take it over, this will start the quest The Battle for Fort Snowhawk. The Pale[edit] The Pale only needs to be liberated if it was given to the Imperials during Season Unending Ulfric will Give you the title ""Snow-Hammer"" and a leveled shield. He will tell you to go to the Pale Stormcloak Camp to help reclaim The Pale, and he will tell you not to forget it's your fault the Imperials have control of The Pale. Head to the camp and speak to Galmar. Galmar will tell you to meet the Stormcloaks preparing for a attack on Fort Dunstad. This starts The Battle for Fort Dunstad. The Rift[edit] The Rift only needs to be liberated if it was given to the Imperials during Season Unending Go to Windhelm and speak to Ulfric, he will tell you to go to their Camp in The Rift and tells you that he holds you responsible for the situation. Head to the camp and speak to Galmar. He will tell you to meet the Stormcloaks preparing to attack Fort Greenwall. This starts The Battle for Fort Greenwall. Winterhold[edit] Winterhold only needs to be liberated if it was given to the Imperials during Season Unending Go to Windhelm and speak to Ulfric, he will tell you that while it may not have seemed that bad to give it up, he now has to waste troops on getting it back. He then sends you to the Winterhold Stormcloak Camp. Head to the camp and speak with Galmar. He will tell you to meet the Stormcloaks preparing to attack Fort Kastav. This starts The Battle for Fort Kastav. Haafingar[edit] After completing the previous quests, return to the Palace of Kings in Windhelm and report your success to Ulfric. He will congratulate you and declare you ""Stormblade"". He will give you a leveled Cuirass and a full suit of Stormcloak officer armor. He will then tell you that the Stormcloaks will take Solitude soon, and that you should report to the Haafingar Stormcloak Camp for further orders. Once you arrive, find Galmar as usual and report in, he will tell you to meet the soldiers preparing to attack Fort Hraggstad and to take the fort, this will start the quest The Battle for Fort Hraggstad. After completing The Battle for Fort Hraggstad, return to Galmar at the camp for further orders, he will simply tell you that the Stormcloaks are taking the capital, and tell you to meet the brothers staging for the final attack. The Battle for Solitude will initiate. After the Battle for Solitude, Ulfric will give you a leveled sword (even if you didn't kill General Tullius) and then ask you to stand at his side while he gives a speech to the men. Whether or not you accept, he will ask you to at least walk out with him. If you decide not to participate in the speech, Ulfric will go directly to thanking the soldiers. In the speech Ulfric will mention you, then go on to thanking the soldiers for all that they have done. He will then declare that he cannot accept the title of high king, until the moot declares him such. A soldier will then yell, ""What about Jarl Elisif?"" Ulfric will then ask her if she will forsake the Empire and swear loyalty to him. Elisif agrees, and Ulfric announces that she will remain Jarl of Solitude. After the speech Ulfric will turn to Galmar and ask how he did, and after some talking Ulfric will thank you and leave with Galmar."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lifting_the_Shroud","Offer to investigate Shroud Hearth Barrow after Wilhelm complains it might be haunted. Explore the barrow and track down the ""ghost."" Take Wyndelius' diary to Wilhelm for your reward.","A Haunted Barrow[edit] When visiting Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead you may overhear the innkeeper, Wilhelm, warning Lynly Star-Sung about a ghost in the nearby barrow. If you are intrigued and like a good ghost story, Wilhelm will inform you that Shroud Hearth Barrow, an ancient Nord crypt just outside of town, is haunted and warns you away from it as well. When pressed further, Wilhelm will confess to seeing the spirit and complain that the haunting is harming his business. If you volunteer to investigate the haunting, Wilhelm will think you daft and tell you of Wyndelius Gatharian, an adventurer who went to explore the barrow a year ago. Screams were heard in the night, and the adventurer was never seen again. Alternatively, you can go directly to the barrow without speaking to Wilhelm beforehand. Ghost Hunting[edit] Enter the barrow. At the first intersection, you might see Wyndelius' ghost through a locked gate to your right, asking you to leave. The first part of the barrow has no enemies, only several traps that you must navigate through. Head left to a room with four levers and pull the two middle levers (the ones closest to the door) to open the two metal gates. The right side lever triggers an arrow trap. In the next room, to the right is an apprentice-locked door. Directly behind it is a pressure plate that activates a spike trap. It is, however, nowhere near the pressure plate so walking slowly over it will leave you unharmed. Beyond the spike trap is a booby-trapped chest. Moving back, pull the chain to open the next gate and continue on. There is a spike trap here too, but once again moving slowly over it will work. Eventually, behind an unlocked door, you will find Wyndelius. Philter of the Phantom[edit] Wyndelius will attack you on sight, unless he is sleeping, which allows you to perform a sneak attack or a stealthy inspection of the room. If you kill him, his ruse is revealed; he is not a ghost at all, and his spectral appearance was due to a potion called Philter of the Phantom. On the table you will find his journal, which explains why he pretended to be a ghost. However, killing Wyndelius is not necessary to complete the quest; you need only recover the journal. Take the journal to Wilhelm and, in exchange, he will reward you with the sapphire dragon claw, the very item Wyndelius gave his sanity and life to possess. The claw is needed to explore the rest of the barrow, which contains a word wall with a part of Kyne's Peace shout."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lights_Out!","Talk to Jaree-Ra in Solitude. Extinguish the beacon of the Solitude Lighthouse. Return to Jaree-Ra. Head to the Wreck of the Icerunner. Deal with the Blackblood Marauders. Clear Broken Oar Grotto.","Jaree-Ra waiting for you at the docks A Quiet Word[edit] In Solitude, find an Argonian named Jaree-Ra leaning against a wall under the stairs closest to the gate. Speak to him, and he asks how you would like making some gold. He then (if you indicate interest) tasks you to put out the fire in the Solitude Lighthouse. A ship called the Icerunner is due to soon come into port, and without the lighthouse fire to guide it, it will crash on the rocks. This leaves it open to be plundered. Jaree-Ra assures you that the men aboard won't be harmed, and 'may even be grateful for the daring rescue we'll perform'. After you agree to snuff the fire, he tells you to meet him again by the Solitude docks. He also warns you to not speak with him beforehand, lest you arouse suspicion. Professional Wrecking[edit] Head northeast to the Lighthouse. There should be no guards in the building, although you may see Ma'zaka. Once you make it to the top, activate the fire to put it out. Then travel back to the Eastern Empire Company Warehouse and find Jaree-Ra. He will tell you that the ship never made it to port, and to go and find the wreck on the north coast (it will be marked on your map). He says his sister Deeja  is already aboard, and is waiting for your arrival. Plunder Away![edit] At the wreck of the Icerunner, you have two ways to proceed. The Blackblood Marauders will not be aggressive when you arrive and you can simply visit Deeja for your ""reward"". Or, you can begin slaying marauders. If you decide to fight the marauders, simply kill everyone in sight; there are no Imperial officers or ship's crew left alive so you won't need to worry about bounty. Make your way to Deeja, kill her, and loot the note from Jaree-Ra that will start the next part of the quest. At this point, skip to the Broken Oars, Broken Promises part of the walkthrough. If you decide to visit Deeja, one of the Blackblood Marauders will stop you and explain that Deeja is on board the ship, two levels down. A possible bug here means the gangway to walk onto the ship doesn't always appear (see Bugs). Around the boat are various containers, mostly food items, with some locked Novice-level chests. The things washed up on shore, as well as on the ship, are regarded as the Blackblood's haul, so taking any of these counts as stealing. Despite Jaree-Ra's words, the sailors aboard are all dead.  Deeja is waiting down in the ship's hold. She will tell you that she was expecting you, and that you'll get what you deserve. Speak to her, and she will explain that the plunder has already been moved, and that you need to be 'taken care of'. She will then turn hostile and attack; kill her, and then loot the body, retrieving a note from Jaree-Ra which explains that the plunder is at Broken Oar Grotto, and that Deeja should kill you once you've arrived. The rest of the Marauders will now turn hostile too; fight your way back to the top deck and make your escape. Broken Oars, Broken Promises[edit] Once free of the ship, head to Broken Oar Grotto. In the cave is a network of scaffolding and wreckage. There are two Marauders at the top of the scaffold to the right. You can hear their conversation if you sneak up on them: Marauder #1: ""You've been here for a while, right? What was it like back when we could still make runs out to the coast?"" Marauder #2: ""Well, before that cave-in sealed our ships in here we could loot any size ship we wanted."" Marauder #1: ""Where did you keep all that loot? I've been here almost a year and haven't seen any of it."" Marauder #2: ""The Captain has it locked away in that drowned ship by his quarters. He says it's ""to keep it safe"" but I know he's just keeping it for himself."" Marauder #1: ""If only we could get our hands on that treasure. We could get out of here and never look back."" Marauder #2: ""Maybe. For now just lay low and do your job. I have a feeling we'll be rid of the Captain soon..."" Once at the top of the scaffold, take care of the two Marauders, then follow the path up the slope. Continue along the ledge until you see the drawbridge, and take out the Marauder guarding it. Pull the lever to release the bridge and cross to the next ledge. The battle ahead will be quite tough, so it's a good idea to save beforehand. You have two options to continue: Follow the Left Path[edit] Heading down the left-hand walkway (which is free of Marauders) will lead you around the cave and will end on a ledge overlooking the ship where Jaree-Ra is hiding. You can pick some of the enemies off from this spot with a bow or ranged magic; if not, release the drawbridge and continue across to the ship and deal with Jaree-Ra and his gang. Into the Cave[edit] Going into the cave on the right will bring you into the Marauder's living area, where there are two enemies but also loot. The cave comes out at roughly the same place as the walkway, but shows a path upwards towards the cave roof. A Marauder is keeping watch near the top of this path, so take care of him before proceeding to the peak. From here you have a good vantage point over the ship, and can take out more of the Marauders with arrows before they can reach you. Be aware that the path continues down to the ship on the other side, and that Marauders can easily run up behind you if you aren't careful. Defeat the marauders and kill Jaree-Ra. After Jaree-Ra is dead, loot his body and the nearby chest for a large amount of gold and various gems. The quest completes once you kill him. Additional loot can be found in the Icerunner Chest, which is located on the top deck of the shipwreck in the water."

Return to Lisbet.","An Empty Store[edit] Near the market in Markarth is the general goods store, Arnleif and Sons Trading Company, where the proprietor Lisbet is struggling to keep her business afloat. Not only did she lose her husband, Gunnar, in a Forsworn attack, she also lost dozens of shipments to the Forsworn, including a precious, specially-made Statue of Dibella. She believes this statue would put the store back on its feet. When you speak with her, she is ashamed of the state of her shop and will then ask you a question: ""You aren't for hire, are you? A sellsword? I'll pay you if you can recover that statuette from the Forsworn."" Accept the task and she will promise you a great sum of gold for your efforts and the quest will be added to your journal.

Find the Left Eye of the Falmer in the Dwemer ruin Irkngthand.","During the course of the Thieves Guild questline, you may run into one of several unique items in locations relevant to the quests. Picking them up will add a miscellaneous task to take it to Delvin Mallory, who will pay a leveled amount of money for the item. The Queen Bee Statue[edit] The Queen Bee Statue in Aringoth's quarters The first trinket that you will likely encounter is the Queen Bee Statue. It is found on a bedside table in Aringoth's room in Goldenglow Estate. This location is visited in the Thieves Guild quest Loud and Clear. When picked up, a prompt will tell you to return the item to Delvin Mallory.  The Honningbrew Decanter[edit] The Honningbrew Decanter is located in a room in the upper floor of the Honningbrew Meadery, behind the door which has an expert lock. You will most likely come across it during the quest Dampened Spirits. The East Empire Shipping Map[edit] The East Empire Shipping Map can be found on a table next to some loot in the Dockmaster's office in the East Empire Company Warehouse. It is easiest to acquire this during the quest Scoundrel's Folly; if you attempt to steal it at any other point, the warehouse may be patrolled by guards, who will attack you on sight if spotted. The Model Ship[edit] The Model Ship is found on a booby-trapped pedestal in Snow Veil Catacombs. The pedestal is surrounded by oil, and removal of the ship causes the oil to burst into flame. It is fairly easy to grab the ship near the doorway and retreat to avoid the fire. It is also possible to shoot one of the exploding urns that fall to set off the trap; however, this causes the ship to fly away from the resulting explosion—into a wall, behind a cabinet or even into the room below—making it easy to lose. Another option is to shoot the ship away from the oil on the ground. Be aware that picking up the ship will still trigger the urns. Another option, if you know the Telekinesis spell, is to stand away from the oil and use the spell to retrieve the ship. Another option is to place an item on the pedestal, preventing the trap from activating when you take the ship. The last option would be to use the ""Slow Time"" shout. Go right up to the pedestal, shout, immediately grab the ship and run away from the oil. Even if you only have the first word of the shout, you will have plenty of time to watch the urns fall to the ground. Of course, you can always set the oil on fire yourself and let it burn up, then take the ship, but the urns will still injure you a bit if you stand too close. Use any flame spell (besides cloak) or the ""Fire Breath"" shout. You can also use whirlwind sprint, grab the ship, and immediately sprint away from the oil. You visit Snow Veil Catacombs during the quest Speaking with Silence. The Dwemer Puzzle Cube[edit] The Dwemer Puzzle Cube is in Calcelmo's Laboratory, which is accessed via the Dwemer Museum in Understone Keep. It is found in the large room with the Arcane Enchanter, just before moving on to the balcony. You travel through the laboratory during the quest Hard Answers. The Bust of the Gray Fox[edit] The Bust of the Gray Fox is found on a table in Riftweald Manor during the quest The Pursuit. It is easy to miss as it blends perfectly with the stone behind it, but it's sitting right next to the quest objective. The Left Eye of the Falmer[edit] The Left Eye of the Falmer can be taken from Mercer Frey's corpse in the Irkngthand Sanctuary during the quest Blindsighted. After you turn in the Left Eye of the Falmer to Delvin, you can steal it back from its shelf in the Cistern within the Ragged Flagon, and sell it again to Tonilia to double your profit. Reward[edit] This is the amount of gold you get each time you turn in an item, except the eye with four times higher reward. The total amount of gold you can accumulate ranges from 50 to 800 gold.

Deepwood Redoubt[edit] Like most other ruins in The Reach, Deepwood Redoubt is crawling with Forsworn enemies, so clear the exterior and enter. Watch out for the dart trap right after the first catacomb, then dodge the archery attacks from the Forsworn enemies overlooking the first chamber. Explore the stony steps to the right of the first set of stairs to find a dead adventurer and a locked chest. Move quickly through the southwestern tunnel, or an enemy may trigger the swinging blades trap. Proceed to the first room and avoid the elemental runes on the floor. Taking the path to the right will lead to a pair of rooms with an Arcane Enchanter in one, and a Forsworn enemy in the other. A Deepwood Redoubt Key is carried by the Forsworn, which unlocks the southeastern door in the room with the runes. Another trap awaits, so avoid the pressure plate, kill the last Forsworn enemy and enter Deepwood Vale through the door. Deepwood Vale[edit] As suggested by the name, Deepwood Vale is an isolated outdoor valley, and can only be accessed through the previous cave. Follow the path down to the bridge and then if not attacked drop into the river and follow it right to an apprentice-locked chest and a Nirnroot at the end of the river. Also there is a sneaky master-locked side-door entrance at the base of the Southern right-hand side tower. After the unavoidable fight against another wave of Forsworn, explore the area for some minor loot inside the southern and northern towers, and a hidden area on top of the waterfall including an expert-locked chest and a pair of fixed  Predator's Grace boots. There is also Quicksilver ore vein here. Finally, locate the entrance to Hag's End and enter. Hag's End Horror[edit] Immediately after opening the first iron door, you will encounter several hostile witches, along with a hagraven. As soon as you attempt to fight the hagraven, she'll teleport herself deeper into the dungeon unless you kill her first, so there is not much to do but pick up the chase. Look to your left as you enter the room for an alchemy lab and a Scroll of Firebolt. Watch out for several traps in the tunnel ahead, then enter the next room for your second encounter with the hagraven and a few witches. Pick the fight, watch the hagraven disappear, then locate the handle behind the throne on the left hand side to lower the stone wall. Your target, the corpse of a Dark Brotherhood Assassin, is hidden behind the wall. He is clad in a complete, unique set of Ancient Shrouded Armor, and by his side is an unlocked chest with leveled gold and loot. When you are done, locate the lever to lower the bridge. Finishing the Hag[edit] Although optional, you may continue on to clear the ruin. Cross the bridge and check the left room for a frostbite spider and the quest-related book The Legend of Red Eagle.  This room also contains a copy of the Hag's End Key which is easily missed on a small shelf to the right of the fireplace. This key unlocks the master-locked gate ahead, which contains a locked, trapped chest. Activate the nearby handle which will elevate three sets of gates and shoot spikes out of the wall. The hagraven is back in the next room, along with two witches and a huge pool of oil. Dispose of the witches, attack the hagraven until she disappears, and pull the chain. This will close the path behind you, but open up for progress on the eastern wall. The next chamber is empty, but contains a word wall for part of the Slow Time shout. Finally, open the door for your final encounter with the hagraven, and your additional rewards. You will find yourself at the very top of Deepwood Vale, with the hagraven waiting for you on a ledge. When you approach the nearby shrine, two leveled creatures will appear and attack. If you managed to kill her before she teleported, her corpse will appear on the ledge and no creatures will attack. Fight the opponents while dodging the destruction spells from the hagraven. Use caution here as you could easily fall to the lower level and have to re-enter the door and work your way back up to the ledge. If you didn't grab the key from the Frostbite Spider room, the hagraven carries another copy. The unique dagger Bloodthorn can be found on the altar, and a boss-leveled chest sits to the left of the door you last came through."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Lost_Expedition","Speak to Calcelmo and ask to investigate the dig site. Recover Alethius' note. Find the expedition members and recover their journals. Re-activate Nchuand-Zel's automated defenses. Speak to Calcelmo about the expedition.","Proceed inside Nchuand-Zel until you encounter Nimhe. After killing Nimhe, head up the steps to find the dead body of Alethius. Pick up the notes next to his body to begin this quest. Burn through the webbing behind his body with fire magic to enter Nchuand-Zel. In the first hallway there is a pressure pad that activates a spear trap. Continuing on, you will emerge into a huge open cavern with multiple levels, with Falmer standing guard on a few of the connecting walkways. At the end of the large walkway is the entrance to Nchuand-Zel Quarters. In this zone, you will encounter quite a number of Falmer, usually in groups. After exiting the first corridor, there will be two ways to go: downstairs or straight ahead. Proceed straight ahead first. When you reach a second set of stairs, there is an adept-locked door to the right containing random leveled loot. At the bottom of these stairs is a large group of Falmer (around 4 - 5). Proceed through these corridors until you come across a large door. To the left of this door is a small room with a bunch of Dwemer items. The door leads to a small balcony overlooking Nchuand-Zel, and also contains a chest with random leveled loot. Head back inside Nchuand-Zel Quarters. Nchuand-Zel Quarters[edit] Head back to the first set of descending stairs you encountered after coming into the Quarters and proceed down them. You will encounter more Falmer along the way. Head up some stairs, making sure to avoid the rune trap at the top, and you will notice a table to the right against a wall. On this table is Stromm's Diary, which you will need for the quest. After picking this up, you will be tasked to collect three other journals: Erj's, Krag's and Staubin's. In the area to the left of this table are the actual Living Quarters, where you will find many Dwemer items, as well as beds you can sleep in. Head back out and past the table until you get to what looks to be a torture room. On the left-hand side of the doorway (as you enter the room) is a lever. Pulling it activates the spike trap on the table next to you. Now head back out to the door where you entered the Quarters from. Backtrack a short distance until you have to turn right (which faces you towards the entrance of the zone). Instead of turning right, head to the left where a ramp will lead you to a lower level. You will notice the balcony you arrived at earlier when heading down this ramp. At the bottom, there are two ways to go. Heading left leads you to a platform a Falmer is (or was) standing on. Instead, go straight down the next ramp which will lead you to the bottom of the area. An adept level gate on your right holds a chest with random loot. Head down the path away from the gate. The path leads to a body of water, so head in and start swimming around to the left until you see another ramp (underwater) leading to a door, which leads to Nchuand-Zel Armory. Enter it. (Note: It is possible to get here by jumping off any of the bridges you have been traversing, or by jumping off the balcony from earlier). Nchuand-Zel Armory[edit] Upon entering the Armory, there are two ways to go: down the corridor or up the stairs. Head through the corridor first. Soon you will come across an adept locked gate, and upon unlocking you will have to go up some stairs. At the top of the stairs is a dead Falmer and Erj's body, along with his diary and a chest containing random loot. The first room to the left at the top of the stairs has nothing of interest, but the second room to the left has an expert-locked gate which leads to a chest with some random loot. Across from that gate is another expert-locked gate with a full set of Dwarven armor. Upon approaching the next gate, a Falmer appears and a Dwarven Sphere awakens and does battle with it. The next gate has nothing of interest and after that is another corridor. The pressure plate ahead of you will activate a spear trap behind you. The next pressure plate up the stairs activates a flame spout trap behind you. After this, there will be two ways to go. Head right. A Falmer is keeping watch ahead of you. Just ahead of him are the stairs you saw when first entering this area (heading through the corridor instead of the steps guarantees you will avoid the traps should you stand on a pressure plate). Head back and go the other way, which brings you to a door leading to Nchuand-Zel. Upon going through the door, you will immediately come across Krag's body and his journal. Head up the ramp (past an Imperial soldier's corpse) which brings you to the final zone: Nchuand-Zel Control. The rocky ramp to the right of the door serves as a shortcut back to the entrance of the ruin. Nchuand-Zel Control[edit] After entering the door, continue through the corridor, encountering more Falmer along the way. A pressure plate just before the upwards ramp activates an dart trap, so either avoid it or wait until it finishes. At the end of the corridor at the top of the ramp are two more Falmer; you will want to attack the one on the right first as it magic-based in combat. The other has both a bow and a sword. The pressure plate in the middle of this corridor activates a spike trap from the ceiling. Be careful of this if you have a follower, as he or she is likely to trigger this trap; even if your follower is essential/permanent, the spikes can kill him or her if they are still going while he/she is crouched. At the end of the corridor, turn left and you will see Staubin's body and his journal, along with a damaged Dwarven Spider. Picking up the final journal grants you a new objective: Re-activate Nchuand-Zel's defenses. Head past the body and up the steps where you will encounter some Dwarven constructs. At first, there should only be a few Dwarven Spider Workers, but fighting them awakens a couple of Dwarven Spheres. Fighting these can draw the attention of a Falmer, if it was not defeated before the Spheres turned their focus towards you.  Continue to the end and you will reach a room with a table and a chest. On top of the table is a leveled healing potion, a Falmer Bow, and a lever. Pulling the lever completes the objective and opens up the gate behind you, so head through. Through the gate and at the end of the corridor is a chest. Now just jump off the bridge to end up back at the entrance door. Upon exiting, you will see a Dwarven automaton fighting a Falmer. This is actually happening all throughout the ruin. Feel free to stay and join the fight, or just head up the ramp to the left and back to the entrance of Nchuand-Zel. Head back to Understone Keep and talk to Calcelmo to receive your reward and finish the quest. Your arrow may point back to the Armory at this point; see ""Bugs"".

Read the book and obtain its knowledge. Return to Neloth.","Neloth[edit] ""Now, it's only a rumor of a whisper of a conjecture."" After completing the quest The Gardener of Men, Tel Mithryn master wizard Neloth will ask you several questions regarding your encounter with Hermaeus Mora. If you have yet to locate any Black Books, Neloth will finish his interrogation with an offer: ""Now all that's left are these Black Books, waiting for another ambitious fool to be lured into Hermaeus Mora's clutches. Speaking of which... I think I've located another book, if you're interested. Here, let me show you."" This will immediately start Lost Knowledge, a quest divided into three parts, but only if you have yet to discover the Black Books hidden in White Ridge Barrow, Benkongerike, and Raven Rock Mine. If you miss out on his first offer the first time, you can ask him if he has found other Black Books, to which the wizard will respond: ""Yes. Hermaeus Mora is devious, but then so am I. Now, it's only a rumor of a whisper of a conjecture. But I think this is the place. Now, hurry. That book might contain the final secrets of Xarxes, for all we know."" Every time you return to Neloth with a Black Book, he will make a copy and let you keep the original. The reward will always be a leveled amount of gold, and his special thanks: ""Excellent! I'll just make a copy for myself. It's far too dangerous to carry the real book around. Of course, I'm sure you can handle yourself. Of course you can. Of course. Now, take this for your efforts, and we'll call the matter closed."" White Ridge Barrow[edit] White Ridge Barrow White Ridge Barrow is an ancient Nordic ruin located in the snowy tundra of northern Solstheim, straight south from the Mortrag Peak landmark. Upon entering, you will find two bed rolls and two  reavers lying in a pool of their own blood. Activate the door bar and open the wooden door and another dead reaver will fall into the room. Proceed down the tunnel and find more dead reavers, along with two dead albino spiders. Follow the circular path to the west and head down the spiral staircase. You will encounter more spiders, both albino and flame cloaked spiders in what is seemingly a giant spider nest. Locate the woodworks to the east and a strange-looking bandit, with a spider attached to the neck, will attack. Jump down into the room below and consider the northern path for a bit of extra loot and a fight against a boss-leveled draugr. Head north and fight yet another spider-infused bandit. Follow the northwestern tunnel and fight the spiders on your way. You will pass a chamber with two ruby geodes and a heart stone deposit and then reach the door to the next zone, White Ridge Sanctum. The Sanctum kicks off with two dead draugr, and, behind the door, a huge chamber with several jumping flame spiders along with even more odd bandits with spiders attached to the neck. You will also encounter Merilar Rendas, a hostile sorceress who will throw jumping flame spiders at you. Defeat her and investigate her body for some really useful items, including her journal, telling the tale of how she slowly turned insane on her brother, thinking he would take credit for discovering the spiders. She also carries a cage door key. Claim the key and locate the wooden stairs to the northeast. The room ahead is filled with spiders, so dispose of them and head up to the cage and unlock it. Inside, you will find Servos Rendas dead, carrying his journal. It describes how he, along with Merilar, discovered the mind-controlling spiders and how Merilar slowly went insane from the fumes caused by the experiments. The cell also hold the spider experiment notes, with Servos' detailed recipes from creating special spiders from albino spiders, along with the device needed to create spiders (please see this article for details). The cage key also fits in the lock of the cobweb-covered door to the north, where you will find no less than four spider-controlled bandits behind a barricaded door, all of them obviously experimental subjects. Dukaan Return to the chamber where you met Merilar Rendas and head south. Remove the spider web and proceed through the tunnel into a huge chamber where the chanting from a word wall can be found. As you approach the wall, the dragon priest Dukaan will burst out of his sarcophagus and attack. He uses a unique spell called Frost Stream and regular Frost Cloak spells and can be a tough opponent. After the battle, claim his mask and a boss-leveled amount of gold and go to the word wall and get a word for the Cyclone shout and claim the contents of the boss chest. Lastly, a pedestal holds the target of the quest, the black book The Sallow Regent. Reading it will start the black book quest. Once you return from the realm of Hermaeus Mora, head back to the chamber with the caged and deceased Servos Rendas and follow the path leading northeast from the cage. You will come across a ladder and a locked trap door. Use the cage key to open it and you will emerge outside, in a small shack a good ways south of the initial entrance to White Ridge Barrow. Lastly, head back to Neloth for your reward and the next task, a trip to Benkongerike. Benkongerike[edit] Benkongerike Benkongerike is an icy cave southeast of Saering's Watch. The exterior decorations reveal that the cave is inhabited by rieklings. Enter the cave and head down the slope and keep an eye out for a narrow tunnel to the right, leading to a locked chest with some minor loot. Before long you will arrive in a huge chamber where four rieklings will attack. Dispose of them and proceed in a southwestern direction where you will encounter a bristleback and a riekling firing at you from a small tower. Take the southern tunnel and follow it until you reach a camp with three rieklings. Proceed forward and defeat two rieklings bursting out of barrels and locate the tunnel leading northeast and beware of the three tripwires triggering claw traps. At this point you will arrive in a huge chamber, complete with an entire riekling village built upon pillars connected with hanging bridges. You will be attacked by numerous rieklings here so fight your way through them and stay on the bridges. Falling down can damage you, but will net you some additional treasure. After traversing the bridges, find the tunnel leading east. The surroundings will now resemble an ancient Nordic ruin, although three rieklings will burst out of their barrels and attack. After the battle, help yourself to some useful potions on the shelves, then enter Benkongerike Great Hall. Rieklings on bristlebacks The Great Hall starts with an empty room with some common books on shelves and a riekling tent filled to the brink with copies of both volumes of The Lusty Argonian Maid. Among the pile, there is a copy of the Spell Tome: Telekinesis. Take the wooden spiral staircase upstairs and follow the corridor leading north. Behind the locked door is a boss-leveled chest, the Benkongerike key on a pedestal, and a rare copy of Dragon Language: Myth no More on another pedestal. Take the path leading east until you reach a huge chamber filled with woodworks with several rieklings roaming around, some of them on the ground floor, others on the bridges above. You will also encounter a riekling riding a bristleback. Search the chamber for some treasure, including a stalhrim deposit, and head south towards the gate and a rune totem puzzle. Three of the rotating symbols have the correct symbol above them, so turn them appropriately. The last one (to the left of the gate) has no symbol, but the correct symbol is the whale. Head inside to a word wall with a word for the Cyclone shout and some boss-leveled treasure from the chest. Lastly, head east through the narrow tunnel until you land in a small room with the Black Book Untold Legends. Pick up the book and you will start the Black Book quest. Once you have the book in your possession, find the door leading back to Benkongerike and return to Neloth for your reward and your next task, a trip through Raven Rock Mine. Raven Rock Mine[edit] The third and final Black Book, The Winds of Change, is found in the depths of Raven Rock Mine. However, you will have to complete the quest The Final Descent to gain access to the book. Please see that article for a complete walkthrough."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lost_Legacy","Talk to Tharstan in Skaal Village. Travel to Vahlok's Tomb and talk to Tharstan again. Explore Vahlok's Tomb and find the main burial chamber. Defeat Vahlok the Jailor and return to Tharstan.","Tharstan[edit] Tharstan packing for the trip The small settlement of Skaal Village is inhabited by Nords living life the old way, with their own culture and religion, especially the worship of the All-Maker. These welcoming and hospitable people let an elderly historian and author named Tharstan live in the village so he could study and document the ancient Skaal traditions. Using what he learned of Skaal culture, Tharstan wrote Children of the All-Maker, and the next book is nearly finished. He also married the Skaal leader Fanari Strong-Voice and now lives in the largest building in town, the Greathall. After your heroic rescue of Baldor Iron-Shaper during the quest A New Source of Stalhrim, Tharstan will decide that you are the right person for a task he has in mind, and will actively seek you out when you next visit the village. As it turns out, Tharstan is not only interested in Skaal traditions, but is equally interested in the many ancient ruins scattered all over Solstheim, claiming to know most of them well enough to draw a detailed map from memory. However, his recent discovery has left him quite nervous about exploring by himself, so he wants you to accompany him as backup. According to Tharstan, a new passage was unveiled during an earthquake caused by the eruption of Red Mountain. The passage revealed the entrance to Vahlok's Tomb. When you agree to go with him, Tharstan will run off to his temporary home, the Greathall, to pack for the trip, hoping you will meet him there as soon as possible.  A Tomb Uncovered[edit] ""A sacrifice will bring you closer to that which you seek."" Vahlok's Tomb is located south-southeast from Thirsk Mead Hall, directly east from Kagrumez. Be sure to stock up on potions and have your best weapons on hand, then take the trip to the tomb. You will find the entrance located at the end of the passage caused by the earthquake. Head down the first tunnel and you will find Tharstan waiting for you. His fascination with the tomb is immediately apparent: ""Remarkable, isn't it? This tomb has been hidden for... well, who knows how long. Many centuries, I would think."" He will then proceed to offer you the first task: ""There are some sealed doors up ahead. Perhaps you can figure out how to get them open."" He will then guide you down a set of stairs and keep talking: ""I've had a look around and the only interesting thing I've found is this inscription here, and a switch below it."" When he arrives at the inscription and the switch he will continue: ""Now, I'm not sure if you can read the dragon language, but this seems to be a riddle of some sort. 'A sacrifice will bring you closer to that which you seek.' I wonder what it means."" When you examine the room it soon becomes clear what needs to be done: dead draugr are scattered all around a gigantic burning hole in the floor, with only a grate to keep you from falling down. As per Tharstan's hint, drag (by holding down the ""Activate"" button) one of the dead draugr onto the grate, then head back up on the podium and activate the handle underneath the inscription. This causes the grate to open and drop the draugr into the flames, acting as the sacrifice needed. While the draugr burns, two entrances in the room will open, one to the north and one to the south.  ""Perhaps they are connected somehow?""Southern GateHead down the southern tunnel and open the iron door. This opens a path through the catacombs, where four leveled draugr enemies will rise and attack. If you are not carrying arrows, pick up a few from the draugr archer in this area; you will need them to solve a puzzle later. Head up the stairs to the east and activate the chain. When the door opens, you and Tharstan will arrive in a puzzle room with three pillars surrounding a large central pillar with different colored symbols. Tharstan will immediately head up to a plaque and start reading: ""Hm... three pillars. Other than that plaque, there doesn't seem to be anything else worthy of note. Let's see what the inscription says. 'All men must die, often by their own means.' Sounds rather grim, if you ask me."" He will then wander around the room, mumbling: ""They also have glowing stones of some kind at the top. They look vaguely similar to drawings I've seen of objects called Impact Stones."" To solve the puzzle, position yourself behind one of the three pillars and perform different attacks, related to the weapons placed on pedestals near the central pillar. Going counter clockwise from the plaque, use a melee attack for pillar one, an archery attack for pillar two, and a magic attack for pillar three. When all three pillars have been activated, the door to the north will open and provide access to the final chamber. Here, two draugr enemies will burst out of their sarcophagi, along with a boss-leveled draugr. After the battle, Tharstan will come rushing in and start to study the chamber, saying: ""These runes have faded a bit, but I believe I can translate the inscription. The writing describes a guardian who defeated someone named Miraak. In fact, if I'm reading this correctly, it says that Miraak was a traitor. Most interesting."" Once he is done, he will start looking for an exit, so make sure you loot the boss for the left part of the Amethyst Claw and approach the word wall for a word for the dragon shout Battle Fury. When you are finished, locate the open sarcophagus and follow the narrow tunnels back to the central chamber.     ""Continue along the path, don't tread where you've been.."" ""This writing refers to a guardian who inspired both men and dragons.""Northern GateHead down the northern tunnel and unlock the minor loot chest in the alcove for a bit of treasure. Tharstan suspects that this room contains another puzzle: ""I expect there's another riddle in here, along with a puzzle. 'Continue along the path, don't tread where you've been..' Interesting..."" He will then look at the odd stone path in the center of the room and conclude: ""Well, I'm pretty sure about two things. One, the riddle is most likely referring to these flat square stones. And two, I'm not going anywhere near them."" With these words, he will find a safe spot and let you handle the rest. The puzzle is quite simple: just go from one square stone to the next, without ever touching one of them twice. Once all nine squares have been pressed down, the way to the final room will open. In there, four draugr enemies and a boss-leveled draugr will immediately attack you while Tharstan runs to safety. After the battle, the old scholar will return to the room and start his studies, saying ""Look! Here's another wall with dragon language inscriptions on it! Let's find out what's written here. This writing refers to a guardian who inspired both men and dragons. I wonder if the guardian was himself a man or a dragon?"" Loot the boss for the right half of the Amethyst Claw and approach the word wall for a word for the dragon shout Battle Fury. Lastly, locate the open sarcophagus to the south and follow the narrow tunnels to a chain that, when activated, lowers a stone wall and provides a very quick shortcut back to the central chamber. The Amethyst Claw[edit] With the two parts of the Amethyst Claw in hand, it is time to unlock the odd cage in the central chamber. Insert the corresponding claws in the keyholes on each side of the stairs leading to the cage. When the cage opens, your elderly sidekick will jump into the cage and translate the plaque: ""Here's another riddle. 'Stay your course. To idle is to die.' Well, at least it's straightforward. There appears to be a switch of some kind here. I'll just stand over here while you flip that switch. I'm sure everything will be fine."" Flip the switch, and several magical platforms will start to emerge and disappear all over the watery area in the chamber, leading to an entrance far away. You will have to follow the platforms while they are present and be on the next platform before the former disappears. When you make it to the other side, the magical platforms will turn into a bridge and Tharstan will be able to join you. A Bridge Too Far[edit] ""I'm glad these platforms appear once you finish them."" Head through the corridor and face the next challenge: a gigantic chamber flooded with water and several corrupted shades lurking below. The drop is a very long one, but luckily a handle is present to create more magical bridges. Activate the handle and follow the bridge as it appears and disappears, landing you on a small alcove. Once again, the platforms will become permanent once you traversed them once, so Tharstan will soon follow, commenting on everything. Yet another magical bridge awaits, and its platforms disappear even faster than before. The last bridge leads to a huge iron door to the north. If you fall down you will not only suffer damage from the fall, but will have to deal with the corrupted shades and locate one of the various shortcuts back to the bridges above. After the last bridge, Tharstan will open the gate leading to the ruins' Hall of Stories, excited as always: ""Ah, the Hall of Stories. These are found in many ancient Nord tombs. There must be hundreds of years of history etched in these walls. Too bad they seem to be too damaged to read."" He will then consider the puzzle door: ""Hmm...looks like it needs some sort of key. Maybe those half claws you found would fit in here if you put them together?"" Naturally, he is correct, but the right combination is nowhere to be seen on the claw, so you will have to pay attention to Tharstan as he deciphers the writings on the walls: ""Perhaps there's enough undamaged text in these etchings to tell us the combination. Ah, yes, here's something. The first one has to do with a breeze, or maybe it's wind. The second one mentions the the [sic] night sky, and the moon. And the third has something to do with fire. It also seems to mention scales."" He will then ask you to figure out the combination from these small tips. Turn the rings on the door to Eagle—Wolf—Dragon (In descending order, Eagle on the top, Dragon on the bottom) and insert the amethyst claw in the keyhole.  Vahlok the Jailor[edit] Vahlok the Jailor The puzzle door will lower to reveal a long staircase leading up to a chain that opens the way to the final chamber. The chamber itself is essentially one big trap, as almost all the tiles on the floor are flame spout traps. Fire resistance and Ward spells can be extremely useful here, so make sure you prepare before entering. You will not make it far into the room before the legendary dragon priest Vahlok the Jailor bursts out of his sarcophagus and starts to throw high-level fire spells at you, so do your best to fight him and avoid the fire. After the battle, old Tharstan will once again come out of hiding and start studying the word wall: ""Hmm, here's another mention of the guardian. I can only assume that this is the guardian's tomb we are standing in now. It says that he was loyal, and his reward was an honorable death. Quite fascinating."" Speak to Tharstan and he will further comment: ""How amazing! A real Dragon Priest! In all my years as a historian, I never thought I'd see anything like that. I suppose that was Vahlok. He must have had this entire place built for him so that he could maintain his vigil, even beyond death."" He will then reward you with 1000 gold and tell you that he will stay in the tomb a while longer, for further studying. Before leaving, make sure to loot the remains of Vahlok for a hefty amount of gold and search his boss-leveled chest. Learn the third and final word for the Battle Fury shout, then backtrack all the way to the entrance."

Taking the Shortcut[edit] It isn't necessary to navigate all the way through Forelhost to get to the upper Battlements. In fact, this is not recommended because it can start another side quest entitled Siege on the Dragon Cult which can make the final battle more difficult as noted above. It usually starts by speaking with Captain Valmir, whose campsite can be seen in the courtyard just outside the dungeon's main entrance, but sometimes there are different triggers. If the quest is initiated it may cause the Lost Paladin to fail to appear once on the Battlements, sometimes even if the quest is completed. In order to skip the dungeon entirely, simply begin jumping up the incline next to the Forelhost Battlements before entering the courtyard and you can eventually work your way up to the top, where the ghost will be waiting near the Word Wall."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lost_to_the_Ages","(Optional) Read The Aetherium Wars. Travel to Arkngthamz. (Optional) Retrieve the unique bow Zephyr. Locate and retrieve the four Aetherium Shards. Locate the Aetherium Forge inside the Ruins of Bthalft. Choose your reward: the Aetherial Crown, Aetherial Shield, or Aetherial Staff.","The Aetherium Wars[edit] In ancient times, the Dwemer constructed four city-states led by the great research center of Arkngthamz in the Reach. Their purpose remains unknown, but the city-states were undefeatable and held their ground against attacking Nords for centuries. Then, in the midst of the First Era, all four city-states suddenly collapsed within three years. The Nords ascribed the destruction of the cities to the strategic genius of High-King Gellir, but many scholars suggested that the cities fell for other reasons—although the mystery was buried along with the cities and merely forgotten. The Aetherium Wars is a tome written in the present day by Taron Dreth which details the fall of the four cities and even offers an explanation for the downfall of the Dwarves: namely, Aetherium, an ultra-rare crystal-like matter with a strong, magical aura. The author suggests that the Dwarves found a considerable amount of Aetherium and started experimenting with forging it into weapons with a newly constructed ""Aetherium Forge"". Due to their brilliance, the Dwemer actually succeeded. The weapons created were so powerful that the strong bonds between the four city-states shattered, as everyone wanted to have access to the Forge, with subsequent conflicts weakening the cities enough for them to be an easy conquest for Gellir. The book ends with a challenge for the adventurer: ""But nothing like the Aetherium Forge described in the inscriptions has ever been found within the borders of Skyrim. It may have been destroyed long ago, by the Nord invaders or the Dwemer themselves. Or perhaps it, like the secrets of Aetherium itself, still remains to be discovered."" The Ghost of Katria[edit] As soon as you open the book, an objective will be added to your journal, encouraging you to investigate Arkngthamz, a Dwemer ruin located down the path from Dushnikh Yal. As you approach the entrance, the earth will quiver underneath you, hinting at things to come. A few feet into the ruin, the whole place will shiver, and an unidentified female voice will echo through the halls, saying: ""Please, turn back... before it's too late..."" Follow the tunnel to a very large chamber and look around for a bit. Before long, a ghost will appear and actively seek you out, asking you if you are there for the treasure. When asked, the ghost will reveal herself as Katria: ""The name's Katria. I am - was - an adventurer. Raided ruins like this for nigh on twenty years. I was on the trail of something big. It led me here, and... I didn't make it."" When you point out the familiarity of her name, she will reveal herself to be the Katria to whom the book The Aetherium Wars is dedicated, although she will angrily add: ""That was my theory, you know. My research. My life's work. All of it, lost! Stolen by my own damn apprentice! That's how I ended up here. I can't rest. Not until I find the Forge, until I can prove that it was my discovery. Mine, not his!"" She will then tell you that she died in Arkngthamz and will warn you once again. You can then persuade her or choose to be friendly or hostile. All three opportunities will lead to Katria giving up and offering her help in guiding you through the ruin. As she obviously knows her way around, there is no real reason to reject her offer, so bring her along. This will finally initiate the quest and you have a long trek before you. Climbing Arkngthamz[edit] ""...this is where I ended up. It was... quite the fall."" Take another look around and get familiar with the place. The clear blue sky is visible above, along with several ledges, while a waterfall feeds an underground lake below. When asked about the state of the place, Katria will tell you that a huge earthquake hit the ruin and destroyed everything, killing her in the process. She will also mention what's ahead of you: ""Well, there's the Falmer, to start with. Deadly rapids. Major earthquakes. Massive chasms. Unstable ground. Lethal falls. And then you get to the real danger. We can discuss that when the time comes. If it comes."" Just above the water is a small ledge with a dead body. Use the fallen pipe to reach the ledge and you will find that it is Katria's body. Katria will sadly comment: ""...this is where I ended up. It was... quite the fall."" She will then ask you to grab her journal from her body. Pick up Katria's journal and search the underground area for a Dwemer chest. From the ledge, head west, past a dead Falmer. As you make your way through the tunnel, two Dwarven spider workers will jump out of the pipe in the ceiling and attack. The next room is flooded, with an unlocked chest underwater in a corner, but another pipe makes a convenient, although narrow, bridge to the northwestern passageway. At the end of the tunnel is a door opening and closing and, behind it, a strange device. Once again, Katria will be helpful: ""See that thing? Dwarves called them 'Kinetic Resonators'. Don't see them very often, least not among the clans in Skyrim. Just hit them, and they'll... do whatever it is they're supposed to do."" Locate the second resonator and hit it with your weapon or a spell. The northern doors will swing open and reveal a staircase leading up. Reaching the Summit[edit] The summit where Katria fell Before long, you will arrive in the central chamber, on one of the ledges above your starting point. Kill the Falmer enemies and keep an eye out for two chests. Proceed upstream along the waterfall using the tiny ledges and bridges and kill all the Falmer you meet. When you reach the top, the bridge will turn into a narrow passageway in the stony wall. Beware of the next chamber and watch your health, as you will be attacked by numerous Falmer, chaurus, and chaurus hunters. At one Falmer camp you can take a detour for a bit of extra loot by heading left through a gate to the southwestern passage that leads to the top of the waterfall and a chest to its left - beware of a Falmer that drops down and attacks you, though. But your target tunnel is the one to the northeast. It leads to a naturally lit cavern, with huge trees reaching toward the blue sky. However, a huge hole in the center, with your starting point a long way below, hints at the destruction caused by the earthquake. A sad Katria will confirm it: ""Here's where I fell. Feels like ages ago."" She will, however, cheer up when she spots one of her old belongings: ""Hey, there's my bow! There, out on the log. Wondered what happened to it."" The bow is the unique Zephyr, one of the fastest bows in the game, so carefully approach and claim it, while making sure not to take the same fall as Katria. Locate the northeastern slope and proceed forward until you reach the summit of the ruin, a very large chamber with a huge Dwemer construction to the north, seemingly the best preserved part of the city-state of Arkngthamz. A huge task is obviously ahead, and all Katria will say is: ""Here we go."" The Tonal Lock[edit] ""See the Resonators up there?"" As you approach the huge construction, Katria will finally explain the real danger she spoke of earlier: ""You know what this is? It's a lock. A 'Tonal Lock'. Simple, and very, very deadly. See the Resonators up there? Strike them in the right order, and the doors should open. Get it wrong, and... well. You've seen what happened when I tried it."" She is obviously referring to the five Resonators, similar to the ones that you saw in an earlier chamber, and you must hit them in the correct order for the door to swing open. When asked for advice, Katria will say: ""Hmm... well, you can pick up where I left off. My notes should still be in my journal, if you can read it. Beyond that... well, maybe one of our predecessors still has a clue."" She refers to a deceased adventurer near one of the pillars, so examine his body for a scrap of paper containing a hint on how to solve part of the tonal lock. Additionally, Katria's journal will have another drawing, depicting what she managed to figure out before the earthquake hit the ruin. The order of the first three Resonators is clearly marked on the two maps, while you will have to guess the last two. The traps still work, as predicted by Katria. Each time you hit an incorrect Resonator, a new trap will trigger and cause mayhem, resetting all Resonators in the process. If you lack a ranged weapon or a spell, get the bow and some arrows from the deceased adventurer. When you choose the wrong Resonator, the various traps will trigger as follows: Unleashes four Dwarven spider workers. Unleashes two Dwarven spheres. Triggers the two Dwemer ballistae under the ceiling. Unleashes the Dwarven Centurion. From that point forward, the ballistae will reload and fire. Place yourself in front of the construction and look at the two drawings. Katria's Journal Scrap of Paper The first three Resonators are easily discernible from the journal and the scrap of paper, but the last two are unknown. You can experiment yourself, or click here for the solution. Once you have hit the right combination, the two side doors will swing wide open and you will have access to the treasury of Arkngthamz without interference from the imprisoned Centurion. In the hidden room behind the Tonal Lock, you will find plenty of Dwemer scrap metal, a few Dwarven metal ingots, and the biggest treasure of all—the Aetherium Shard, located on a small podium. When picked up, an overwhelmed Katria will say: ""Let me see it. ...Huh... What? What is this? Look, on the edge here. This has been cut, precisely cut. If you had another piece, about the same size, it would... it would snap right in. I saw a drawing of this once. This shard... it's... it's part of a key. A key made of pure Aetherium! The key to the Forge!"" She will then explain what needs to be done: ""We have to find the other pieces, of course. There should be, hmm... three more. One for each of the four cities that worked on the Forge. I had a map, in my journal. That's where we should start."" She will, however, realize the size of the task at hand: ""We still have to find the Forge itself. I had a lead on that, too. There's so much to do. I'm going to head out and start tracking things down. We'll meet again, I'm sure of it. For the first time in a long while, I think I - we - may actually be able to do this. And... and I owe it all to you. Thank you."" She will then disappear and leave it to you to loot the chest behind the pedestal for a boss-leveled treasure and find your way back to the entrance. The easiest way is to locate the small tunnel in the water in front of the Tonal Lock, then make your way to a small ledge above the huge main chamber where you met Katria for the first time. You will need to make a running jump to clear some rocks and hit the water. If you are unable to do this then the Whirlwind Sprint or Become Ethereal shouts will help; if these are unavailable, then you will need to walk the long way back to the entrance. Hunting the Shards[edit] When you surface from Arkngthamz, up to three map markers will have been added to your map if you've already discovered those locations, if not, then it is up to you to find the shards, matching Katria's scribbling in her journal and the number of shards still in need of uncovering. You will have no choice but to travel to all three destinations, in no particular order. Katria will have numbered each spot on her own map in the journal, along with some quick thoughts, so it's worth reading through. The Aetherium Site[edit] Mentioned as a 'Bthar-zel' ('allied city'?). Not Bthardamz, though. This is located just north of Bthardamz, specifically a landmark known as Deep Folk Crossing, a bridge over a waterfall with two watchtowers of Dwemer architecture. Head north up the hill from the bridge and you will find a large podium, with yet another Dwemer Convector, which is empty. Placed on the other side is the Aetherium Shard. When you pick it up, Katria will appear and thank you, then disappear once again.  The Aetherium Mine[edit] The primary source of Aetherium. Extracted from some deeper mine? The shard here is in the huge Dwemer ruin of Raldbthar, which is located between Lake Yorgrim and the White River, southwest of Windhelm and almost directly east of Shearpoint. Members of the Dark Brotherhood may have visited the ruin beforehand as part of the quest Mourning Never Comes (if not, see this section for potential bugs), as it is the hideout of infamous bandit leader Alain Dufont. The Aetherium Shard is located at the very end of the ruin in Raldbthar Deep Market, so get ready for a long trek. NOTE: Even if you have already cleared the ruin, the elevator may be shut tight due to the exterior cell re-spawning after 10-30 in-game days. As a result, no easy access will be available to the final chamber of the ruin and you will have to go through it all again. Jump up to the elevator and see if it is accessible; otherwise, click the show button to the right for a full dungeon walk-through.  Full walkthrough → Dispose of the three bandits guarding the exterior area and enter through the main gate. Down the tunnel will be another bandit, ready to go to sleep on one of the bedrolls, so approach carefully and kill him. At the next intersection, the residing bandits have made good use of a constantly burning flame spout trap, cooking a charred skeever in the flame. You can either dodge the trap and proceed straight ahead or take the longer route to the east; the latter option will net you several more encounters with patrolling bandits but will also provide an opportunity to kill Alain Dufont and his companions with the lever-operated Dwemer ballistae on the ledge above their camp. In either case, open the gate southeast of the camp and search the next room for the Sneak skill book 2920, Last Seed, v8, right above a locked Dwemer chest. The southwestern corner has a master-locked gate blocking a bit of worthwhile treasure, while your target is behind the huge door to the southeast. Follow the corridor as it twists and turns, then open another set of doors into a huge chamber guarded by numerous Dwarven spiders and spheres. Use the oil on the floor to your advantage, then proceed southwest. Around the next corner, beware of the two sets of spinning blades and dodge them as you move up the slope. Next up is a huge chamber in two levels, with a flame spout trap and a sphere. Head up the stairs and fight another sphere, then follow the oil slick to yet another set of stairs. Take the tunnel leading northwest and fight two spiders before pulling the elevator handle that will take you to the next area, Raldbthar Deep Market. In the Deep Market, the surroundings have changed considerably, hinting at the ruins' connection to the Dwemer city of Blackreach. Head down the dark slope and avoid the spinning blades by hugging the walls. Open the door to a large chamber in several levels, crawling with Falmer enemies, skeevers in cages, and dead humans. Make your way to the stairs leading up, then follow the slope to the huts. Up there, a bridge leads to a platform in the northeast; cross it and kill the Falmer. Activate the button on the table behind the tent and watch the bridge lower on the central platform. Backtrack and cross the now-lowered bridge to proceed into a small tunnel, only to re-emerge in the same chamber. Making sure not to fall off the edge, cross the rooftops until you find an opening in the grate. Find the narrow tunnel leading west, then south. You will meet a few Dwarven spiders here, along with a pressure plate triggering a deadly explosive bolt from the Dwemer ballista on the adjacent platform. Make your way through lots of steam and pipes and beware of another pressure plate triggering a claw trap. The steam also hides a spider and sphere. Head to the big northwestern door and open it. Up the slope are four buttons placed next to each other. Only two of them still work. The first on the left will trigger two flamethrower statues, while the third from the left will lower the portcullis blocking your way through the western tunnel. Open the door and face the final chamber of the Deep Market. Four Falmer enemies will be lurking around the many tents, while several chaurus can be heard rattling in a closed pen to the south. Make your way west toward the pond with the broken machinery. The noise indicates that the wheels are stuck, so remove bones, skulls and spines from the wheels so they can work properly again, including the scrap stuck in the wheel underwater. When everything runs properly, stand on the bridge and press the button to see the bridge lower. No escape yet, as the lowered bridge reveals a leveled Dwarven centurion. After fighting it off, loot the chest where the Centurion rested, then open the door. Follow the tunnel and pull the lever. Kill the three spiders and a sphere then head into the northeastern chamber to claim your Aetherium Shard. The elevator leading up can be found to the southwest, so hear what Katria has to say, then ride it up into the fresh air.   The Aetherium Storage[edit] A storage site for raw Aetherium, just outside a major city. A few feet south of the gigantic Dwemer ruin of Mzulft sits a smaller building named Dwarven Storeroom. Inside, you will see Katria standing in front of a locked door, who will ask for help prying it open. However, another door to the southwest has an apprentice-leveled lock and leads to a small room with several ingots and two minor loot chests. At the end is another door leading left, also with an apprentice-leveled lock. Pick it and enter the room Katria initially wanted to enter, and claim the Aetherium Shard on the podium. Katria will appear and thank you, then disappear again. The Aetherium Crest[edit] The Ruins of Bthalft Once you have claimed all four shards, an excited Katria will tell you to meet her at the Forge, although it is unclear where the Forge actually is. Fortunately, she marked the location on your map (based on location 5 from her own map), so travel to the small Ruins of Bthalft southeast of Ivarstead to meet her again. As foretold by her journal, the altar here has an astrolabe on top and space for a round object in the middle. When you arrive, Katria will seek you out and say: ""You made it! And you've brought the shards! She will then tell you to check out the device: Look at the device here - the gear in the center is just about the right size. Try putting the shards in and... we'll see what happens."" Obey her orders and activate the Dwemer Mechanism, and watch while the shards turn into a perfectly round Aetherium Crest, although nothing else will happen. Katria will suggest moving the finished crest from the device; do so and then keep your distance from the mechanism, as the earth will begin to tremble heavily underneath you. Before long, a huge tower will shoot up from the ground, revealing an entrance with a handle in the middle. Katria will head on inside, fascinated with the uncovered secret, so follow her and push the handle to take the elevator a long way down. What Lies Beneath[edit] ""The air here... it feels different. Almost like..."" As the lift ends its incredible descent Katria will express some concern: ""That took longer than usual... How deep are we?"". Go through the open wall on your right to find an apprentice-locked chest with random levelled loot. Return to the lift and pull the handle next to the gate. The gate will open and the first brazier will light. The path is the only way to go here, and the braziers will light before you as you follow it across the river. Before crossing the river at the bottom of the first set of stairs, turn right to find a path that circles around to an apprentice level chest. Return to the main path. The braziers automatically activate casting light over a cave-like structure. Before starting to cross the river using the land bridge, first descend the rest of the way to the water level on the dirt path. Continue into the water. Swim under and keeping left to find a soul gem underwater. Next to it is a skeleton and a dwarven sword. Also swim to the waterfall. Behind the waterfall is a locked chest. Return to the main path again. Cross a land bridge to reach a small altar filled with Dwemer gear and scraps. Katria will tell you, ""Just think ... No one's been here for four-thousand years."" Head west over the next bridge to a huge stairway leading up between several smaller buildings. Before climbing the stairs, go east to follow a path at the cliffs' edge to find a leveled Dwarven Battleaxe with a random enchant. Return to climb the Great Stairs, ignoring the frozen Dwemer Spheres on either side. At the top of the stairs stands a tree, almost completely yellow, and is obviously dead and frozen in time. There are two blocked entrances, north and south. The south entrance has an expert-locked chest. The north entrance leads into the cliff and to the top of the waterway you crossed over twice by bridge before. Turn to the right and hug the northeastern part of the building which leads to two silver ore veins. Here is where you get to that chest mentioned earlier. Go back to the beginning of this path and swim across to the expert-level chest. Before you swim back across to continue the quest, dive to the east. Right before the water cascades down, you can find a small filled soul gem on the ground. Now return to the main path. When you approach the western gate, Katria will say: ""Door's shut tight. I bet those Resonators would open it, though."", pointing your attention to the two resonators high above. Hit the two Resonators with a ranged weapon or spell and the gate will open. As you descend the stairs Katria will comment: ""The air here... it feels different. Almost like..."" At the bottom of the stairs the hall turns to the South and ends at a door. On your left, just before the door, are two Health potions, a Potion of Magicka and an Elixir of Resist Fire. There will also be a random Dwarven Helmet. It's a good idea to retrieve all the potions before opening the door. You'll need them. The Forgemaster[edit] The Forgemaster attacks Katria with its fire breath. Behind the next door sits a huge construction, although most of the room is covered in steam billowing up from the floor. You will lose health if you go through the steam, so pay attention to the platforms in the eastern and western corners. Get up on one and activate the steam valve, which will cause half of the steam to disappear. Get over to the other and turn the valve to dissipate the steam entirely. Unfortunately, the entire place is booby-trapped and before long, numerous Dwarven spiders will jump out of the many tubes, and they keep coming until four Dwarven spheres join in. In the middle of the battle, the steam will be turned back on, leaving very little space to fight, so jump back up and turn off the steam if you can. When all four spheres have been dealt with, a sudden noise can be heard from the lava, and a gigantic centurion named The Forgemaster will surface and immediately spray blasts of liquid fire at you. This can be a tough battle, but Katria will prove worthy and can quite easily deal with the Forgemaster herself. Once he is on the ground, you can behold the Aetherium Forge in all its glory, finally rediscovered after 4000 years. An excited Katria will rush up to you and yell: ""I... I almost can't believe it. We did it! We actually did it! There's only one thing left to do. We have to prove this actually works. That this is the real Aetherium Forge."" The Aetherium Forge[edit] Katria beholds the Aetherium Forge. It is obvious that she wants to forge something, but the crafting materials are nowhere to be seen, especially not the ultra-rare Aetherium. Katria will respond: ""There isn't any Aetherium here, is there? Damn it! Wait! ...Yes, yes there is. The shards we collected... they're pure Aetherium, remember? It's not much, but it'll do. With them, and the materials in this room, we should have everything we need."" A useful marker will point you to a chest in an alcove, which is filled with Dwarven metal ingots, ebony ingots, silver and gold ingots, refined malachite and a string of flawless rubies and sapphires. With these items in hand, Katria will stand aside as you approach the mighty Aetherium Forge, where you can craft three different, and very powerful, objects, although only one can be made, as it will consume the Aetherium Crest in the process. Pick carefully: The Aetherial Crown is a circlet that allows you to use two standing stone abilities simultaneously. The Aetherial Shield is a heavy shield that makes enemies become ethereal (unable to attack or be attacked) for 15 seconds when shield-bashed. The Aetherial Staff is a staff that summons a Dwarven spider or Dwarven sphere for 60 seconds. Once you have used the Forge, Katria will bid you farewell: ""And with that... it's done. No one could possibly deny what we've found now."" She will then start to fade, saying: ""For me? I've done what I set out to do. But you... take that out into the world. And if anyone asks, tell them what we discovered. Together. And now... I think I can rest. Farewell, my friend, wherever your travels take you."" Before she disappears completely, she will bow before you, respectfully. Don't forget to check the alcove on the other (east) side of the room for loot before you leave. If you have enough fire resistance, you can swim to the corners of the lava lake left and right to find gates to open. They will have loot behind them and corridors leading you back to the main room. The Aetherium Wars, Pt. 2[edit] Meanwhile, the author of the book, Taron Dreth, will be wandering the wilderness of Skyrim with his band of personal mercenary guards and claiming to be the world's foremost expert in Dwemer metallurgy, based on the research that he stole from Katria. If you run into him while wearing or carrying the unique Aetherium item that you made, Taron will immediately realize that his fraud has been called and will aggressively run up to you, saying: ""Your crown/staff/shield... gods, it's made of Aetherium! Pure Aetherium! Where did you find it? Tell me!"" He will then demand the artifact so that he can keep his secret safe. Regardless of your answer, you will get revenge on behalf of Katria, as Taron will see no other option but to claim the artifact from you with the words: ""Then I'll take it from your corpse!"" He and the three mercenaries will then attack you. He is a very powerful elemental mage and can be quite challenging, but in the end, the only thing left to tell the tale of the four Dwemer city-states and the rare, luminescent crystal will be the tome The Aetherium Wars."

Return to Brynjolf.","Sweeter than Golden Honey[edit] Once Mercer has allowed you into the Guild, he'll challenge you with a new job. Goldenglow Estate was once the Guild's sweetest deal. The Guild made sure that the honey flowed constantly to Maven Black-Briar's meadery by keeping the workforce in line and scaring off potential competitors. In return it was allowed to extort huge sums of money from Aringoth, the owner. However, the shipments have suddenly ceased and when Vex was sent to investigate she found an army of mercenaries. Maven isn't pleased and it's your job to teach Aringoth a lesson by burning down three bee hives and clearing out his safe. Before leaving, pay Vex a visit and she will tell you about a secret sewer entrance on the northwest side which will make it significantly easier to enter unseen. As Loud as an Angry Beehive...[edit] Your first objective is to burn the beehives, which you can reach in two ways. The simplest route is to wade ashore on the northernmost island, dispatch the numerous mercenaries protecting the estate and then burn the hives. A stealthier solution is to wait until dusk, swim to the rocky outcrop to the west of the beehives and then clamber ashore, hidden by a small wooden wall. The secret sewer entrance leading into the estate To set the beehives on fire you can use a torch, the Fire Breath Shout, or a fire-based spell; simply standing next to a hive with a torch or spell equipped will suffice. A rapid execution is important as three mercenaries will come rushing to investigate, so quickly burn the three southernmost beehives and then retreat behind the wall. Jump back into the lake and circle around to the northern island. Be careful not to burn more than three beehives, or you will forfeit your gold reward. ...and as Silent as a Skeever[edit] Wade ashore underneath the wooden platform on the northwestern end of the island and dive into the sewer grate nearby. The sewer is only inhabited by a few skeevers, three of which can be taken out by using an oil slick and some fire. About half-way through is an adept-lock cell where you'll find the Pickpocket skill book Guide to Better Thieving. After leaving that room continue down the corridor and you will find a ladder back to the surface.  Climb it and you will resurface next to the back entrance of the estate, which has an expert level lock and lands you in a more favorable location than the front door. Alternatively, you can sneak your way to the front door, which is unlocked, or take out the mercenaries and enter through either door. Breaking and Entering[edit] The Queen Bee Statue in Aringoth's quarters Inside the estate you will find numerous mercenaries which you can either kill or sneak around. You should eventually arrive at a corridor patrolled by a mercenary while two more sit at a table. Avoid them by sneaking into the nearby dining room and you'll find yourself in front of a gate leading to the basement and a ladder leading to the second floor. Heading upstairs will earn you more loot and you'll be able to take the safe's key off Aringoth. The first mercenary can be avoided by slipping into a room on the left, traversing it and then moving down the corridor hugging the wall and using a wardrobe to screen you. In the last room, slowly sneak behind the back of a mercenary sitting at a table and pick open the door. Here you will find Aringoth and you can retrieve the safe key by either pickpocketing him, killing him or persuading him to hand it over.  You must pass a hard-level Speech check to persuade Aringoth and, if you fail, he will attack you, alerting the nearby mercenary. There is also a Queen Bee Statue on the nightstand next to the bed which can be sold to Delvin.  Sweep the Safe[edit] The safe containing Aringoth's riches Whether or not you have the key, unlock the metal gate once the mercenary patrolling the corridor has turned around and enter the basement. Sneak past or dispose of two mercenaries in the first room. Using a spell to set fire to the oil puddle leading up to his chair can aid you with dispatching the last mercenary. If you wish to remain undetected, sneak to the dark corner behind him, shoot an arrow down the corridor and slip away when he charges off to investigate. Alternatively, invisibility or the dragon shout Throw Voice will also work. Pick the safe or open it with its key and retrieve the Goldenglow Bill of Sale and some gold. Before you leave, loot the nearby chest and scoop up some gold purses. A gate will lead you back into the sewers, so exit them and swim away to the shore. Reaping the Rewards[edit] Head back to the guild and talk to Brynjolf. As long as you've completed the job to the letter, he'll be very pleased and reward you with a leveled amount of gold, as detailed below. If you burn more than three beehives, you will not get a reward, with Brynjolf saying, ""You've made a mess of things and Maven's furious. I told you not to burn more than three of the hives! I've smoothed things over with her for now, but you can forget your cut."" Either way, he'll also point you to Maven Black-Briar, who has requested you for a special job. Levels Reward   1-5 50   6-10 100   11-15 200   16-20 300   21-26 400   27-31 500   32-36 600   37-41 700   42+ 800"

The local bard, Sven, and the Wood Elf hunter Faendal, are both vying for Camilla's favor; and will resort to slander and libel to win it. What a Tangled Web We Weave[edit] If you approach Sven first, at the Sleeping Giant Inn, you will come to know of his love for Camilla, and about his suspicions about Faendal's involvement in her life. Sven will then ask you for a favor: deliver a fake letter supposedly written by Faendal to Camilla, seemingly breaking things off with her due to her being an Imperial, and him a proud Bosmer.  You may also speak to Faendal first. He can be found chopping wood near the lumber mill or wandering the village. Faendal also has feelings for Camilla and a desire to see Sven out of the picture. He asks you to deliver his own fake letter designed to disrupt Sven's wooing by outlining out the household chores he has planned for Camilla.  With either letter, you can go straight to Camilla, or show the supposed letter to the other man, prompting them to hand over their own forged letter for you to deliver. When We Practice to Deceive[edit] When you decide who you want to help, either Sven or Faendal, deliver the letter to Camilla. Camilla is usually at the Riverwood Trader, but at night she can sometimes be found at the Sleeping Giant Inn. When you talk to Camilla, you have two ways of proceeding. You can lie to her and give her the forged letter as is, or tell her the truth about the ruse. In either case, she will effectively break off her interactions with the loser.

If you enter the Riften Jail, you will come across Sibbi Black-Briar residing in one of the jail cells. You may ask him how he ended up in jail, he will respond with: ""Look, we all have our flaws; mine is that women can't get enough of me. So I had this little affair going on while I was betrothed to a beautiful girl named Svidi. Well, she finds out and she tells her brother, Wulfur. Then her brother attacks me with a knife... I mean, I had to defend myself"" Now, he is very angry about that girl. ""I'd do anything to have that whore's head on a platter."" All he needs to know is where she is. If you can help him find his fiancee, he promises you'll be well compensated. You may ask him for more information about Svidi. He will respond with: ""She was a young woman... buxom, with long flowing black hair. She used to sing the most lovely songs to me when we were courting. I've never heard a voice so beautiful. All that talent will go to waste when I'm finished with her."" A Bard in the Inn?[edit] According to Sibbi's description, you may find such a woman in the Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead. Now, she is a bard under the name of Lynly Star-Sung. You may tell her that you know she is Svidi, she will initially deny it. ""No, I'm sorry. You must have me mistaken for someone else.

You may ask Svidi to tell you her side of the story, she will reply with: ""Sibbi and I were to be married. We were supposed to be happy together forever. Then I found that wretched poetry from Svana. When I confronted Sibbi about it, he threatened to kill me. I was scared so I told my brother Wulfur. He went to talk to Sibbi for me and... and... Sibbi killed him. My brother wasn't even armed! When I heard what Sibbi did, I fled. Now you've found me, and you're going to tell him where I am."" A Choice in Your Hand[edit] Return to Sibbi and tell him you have got some information about Svidi. He will be very glad. ""Good, good. Just point me in the right direction and I'll do the rest."" At this point, you will have to make a decision: tell him the truth or lie to him. Option  Dialogue   She's in Ivarstead using the name Lynly. Ivarstead? So close to Riften? She's an even bigger fool than I thought.   She's made her way east into Morrowind. So, the whore thinks the Black-Briar reach ends at the border of Skyrim, eh? She'll soon discover her mistake.   Never mind. I was mistaken. You idiot. You came all the way down here for that? Whichever option you choose between the first two, Svidi will not be killed, and Sibbi will give you his key to a long chest found in the basement (at the bottom of the stairs) of the Black-Briar Meadery in Riften, saying ""You've done me a great service, my friend. Allow me to compensate you for the information."" The chest will always contain one random weapon, two poisons, and some gold, along with the Prowler's Profit gems, if applicable.

Return to Falk Firebeard.","The Messenger[edit] In Solitude, the innkeeper and residing bard at the Winking Skeever will all tell you about a scared Dragon Bridge resident who recently arrived to ask Jarl Elisif for help. They will not reveal anything else, so head to the Blue Palace, where you will witness Varnius Junius trying to convince Elisif that the  inexplicable disappearances and strange occurrences near Wolfskull Cave should be taken seriously. While Elisif tries her best to calm the near hysterical Varnius, her court wizard and steward will both disregard the claims: ""Haafingar's people will always be safe under my rule."" Varnius: ""I swear to you, unnatural magics are coming from that cave! There are strange noises and lights! We need someone to investigate!"" Elisif: ""Then we will immediately send out a legion to scour the cave and secure the town. Haafingar's people will always be safe under my rule."" Varnius: ""Th...thank you, my Jarl thank you."" Sybille: ""Your eminence, my scrying has suggested nothing in the area. Dragon Bridge is under imperial control. This is likely superstitious nonsense."" Falk: ""Perhaps a more... tempered reaction... might be called for?"" Elisif: ""Oh. Yes, of course you are right. Falk, tell Captain Aldis I said to assign a few extra soldiers to Dragon Bridge."" Varnius: ""Thank you, Jarl Elisif. But about the cave..."" Falk: ""I will have someone take care of the cave as well Varnius, you can rest easy. You're dismissed."" After the court has acknowledged his claims, Varnius Junius will be relieved and leave the castle, unaware that nobody plans on doing anything to solve his problem. Speak to Falk Firebeard, who will admit he thinks Varnius is overreacting and that he has his hands full dealing with the recent murder of High King Torygg, the grieving Elisif, and the ongoing war. Offer to take a look at Wolfskull Cave for him, and he will gladly accept. Wolfskull Cave[edit] Wolfskull Cave is located due west of Solitude and north of the Statue to Meridia. As you arrive, two skeletons will guard the entrance, hinting at darker things to come. Enter the cave and proceed through the first chamber. Before long, you will be attacked by hordes of leveled necromancers, all keen on protecting their secret. As you progress, leveled draugr and more skeletons will attack. In the third chamber, you will arrive at a pit, and will have no choice but jump in. Take the northern tunnel and enter Wolfskull Ruins. ""We summon Potema!"" As you enter, it quickly becomes clear that something is very wrong in the cave; blue beams of light spear across the room and chanting voices can be heard: Ritual Master: ""Wolf Queen. Hear our call and awaken. We summon Potema!"" Necromancers: ""We summon Potema!""  Ritual Master: ""Long have you slept the dreamless sleep of death, Potema. No longer. Hear us Wolf Queen! We Summon You!"" Necromancers: ""We summon Potema!"" Take a look from the ledge and you'll notice that the blue lights all lead to the same platform, high above ground level. Backtrack a bit and locate the tunnel leading west. The chamber ahead is covered in oil, so use it to your advantage against the patrolling necromancer. The Wolf Queen[edit] Back in the main chamber, there are stairs leading further down and enemies will attack. Fight your way to ground level and enter the ruin where a set of stairs will lead back up. As you make your way upstairs, it becomes apparent that the necromancer's ritual is about to go wrong, as Potema will shout: ""Summoned with words. Bound by blood."" Potema's escape Potema: ""Yes! Yes! Return me to this realm!"" Ritual Master: ""As our voices summon you the blood of the innocent binds you Wolf Queen!"" Necromancers: ""Summoned with words. Bound by blood."" Potema: ""What! What are you doing?! You fools! You cannot bind me to your wills!"" Necromancers: ""Summoned with words. Bound by blood."" Potema: ""You ants don't have the power to bind me!"" Keep going up one set of stairs after another, fighting the opposition on your way. As your reach the source of the blue light, the ritual master will speak once again: ""Something is wrong. There is an intruder."" As you climb the tower, an additional four necromancers will attack. At the top, you will find the ritual master busy performing the ritual to revive Potema. There is only one way to stop her. When she is dead, the blue light will disappear through a hole in the ceiling and everything will be quiet. Read the Light Armor skill book The Refugees from the altar, then activate the lever to lower the drawbridge. Loot the chest on the other side and follow the path, a shortcut back to the first chamber of Wolfskull Cave. Falk Firebeard[edit] Back in the Blue Palace, busy castle steward Falk Firebeard will be curious to know whether you found anything other than wild animals and bandits in Wolfskull Cave. When you tell him that necromancers tried to resurrect Potema, he will be shocked and will ask if you stopped them. At this point, you will have no choice but to tell him you interrupted the ritual and that it is done. He will then explain that you have done Solitude a larger service than you can imagine and reward you with a leveled amount of gold. However, Potema is far from defeated. After you level up at least once and wait a few days, a courier delivers a very concerned letter from Falk Firebeard, beginning the quest The Wolf Queen Awakened."

Search the Attius Farm for clues, and give the note you find to Captain Veleth. Kill General Falx Carius at Fort Frostmoth. Return to Captain Veleth.","Aiding the Captain[edit] Captain Veleth fights the ash spawn Captain Veleth is the leader of the Redoran Guard in Raven Rock, the capital of Solstheim, his powers only surpassed by Councilor Morvayn and his second-in-command Adril Arano. Recently, Raven Rock has experienced several attacks by ash spawn and Captain Veleth is naturally trying to figure out what is going on. South of Raven Rock lies the burned-out Old Attius Farm where you will find Captain Veleth fighting several ash spawn, immediately starting the quest. Help him defeat the enemies and he will be quite grateful, saying: ""Thanks... I wasn't sure I'd make it off this farm alive. I wish I could have said the same for my man here."", obviously referring to the dead Redoran Guard nearby. He then proceeds to tell you about the ash spawn attacks and that he was searching for clues at the old farm when he was attacked. You will now have three different options, each with a different response: I'd be glad to lend you a hand. ""Good, I can use all the help I can get."" I could lend you a hand... for a price. ""Hmm. I think I could talk the councilor into paying you, and I could use an extra pair of hands."" Seems like a waste of time to me. ""It's easy to criticize when you're just a visitor here. Since you're brimming with self-confidence, maybe you'd care to take over for me?"" Declaration of War[edit] Regardless of your choice, Captain Veleth will then proceed to tell you why he was at the farm and task you: ""We were searching the farm when the ash spawn ambushed us. Have a look around and see if you can turn up anything useful."" You can now ask him several questions about the attacks and he will explain that he believes that someone is controlling the ash spawn and that the abandoned farm is his only clue as the enemies seem to emerge from there. Search the ash piles from the defeated enemies and you will find the Declaration of War, a strange note written by Falx Carius, a general living at Fort Frostmoth. Tell Captain Veleth about the letter and he will be surprised and tell you about the author of the note: ""Carius was the Imperial garrison commander at Fort Frostmoth, but he died over 200 years ago when the Red Mountain leveled the place. There's no way he could still be alive."" He will then ask you to investigate while he ""rallies the guard"" back in Raven Rock. Fort Frostmoth[edit] While Captain Veleth returns to Raven Rock, head east from the farm and you will soon arrive at the ash-covered Fort Frostmoth, where a mysterious voice will shout out: ""Men, an invader has entered the fort! Prepare yourselves for an ambush!"" After this, several ash spawn will attack and shower you with firebolt spells while the voice continues: ""Fort Frostmoth will never fall! Long live the Empire!"" Fight them all and enter the fort. The interior is covered in ashes and old imperial armor sits on the knocked-over shelves, hinting at the original inhabitants 200 years back. Before long more ash spawn will detect you and attack, so pick the fight and locate the path to the north. In the next chamber, search around for the skeletal remains of Maximian Axius and read all of his letters to Selina for a bit of background story of what happened at the fort when Red Mountain erupted. The path to the west leads to a dead end and a nest of albino spiders. A gate with a master lock gains access to a storeroom with all the ingredients needed to make a large quantity of Elsweyr Fondue. Falx Carius[edit] ""Fort Frostmoth will never fall! Long live the Empire!"" Take the northern path and you will end up in a huge tomb filled with coffins. At the intersection, where an ash spawn lies in wait, take the western path first and search the knapsack for the Fort Frostmoth Key and read through the informative Ildari's Journal that sits on the coffin in the center. It is the journal of a conjurer named Ildari Sarothril who uncovered the tomb and started experimenting with using heartstones to reanimate the dead bodies of the imperials, including the deceased general Falx Carius. She succeeded but the general slowly became hostile and she had to abandon the experiment. With the key in hand, return to the first room and unlock the wooden door next to Maximian Axius's skeleton. (though you could also use the key to unlock the gate with the master lock, if you were unsuccessful or found lockpicking it too difficult). Head up the stairs and you will soon spot your target in the distance, Falx Carius himself, reanimated and still fighting to protect Fort Frostmoth, thus sending ash spawn to what he believes are enemies living in Raven Rock. If fought toe to toe, he is a very powerful foe and won't go down easily, nor will the ash spawn minions around him.  Sadly, none of General Carius' armor can be looted, but claiming his unique enchanted warhammer Champion's Cudgel should serve as a consolation prize, along with the large chest nearby. Afterwards, leave Fort Frostmoth via the ladder to the south. The Reward[edit] Back in Raven Rock, Captain Veleth will have picked up his usual routines but will be eager to hear news from Fort Frostmoth. When you tell him that you killed the reanimated General Falx Carius he will be pleasantly surprised: ""I had my suspicions that he was undead. How else could he have survived for over 200 years? It's a shame. There are quite a few tales of General Carius's exploits, including the founding of Raven Rock. Councilor Morvayn told me to give this to you if you made it back in one piece... and you got rid of General Carius."" He will then hand you a leveled amount of gold as reward. Once you have completed this quest and The Final Descent, Captain Veleth will have another task ready for you, namely the quest Served Cold. Reward[edit] Levels Reward   1-29 1,500   30-39 2,500   40-49 5,000   50-59 7,500   60+ 10,000"

At the Sacellum of Boethiah in the fenced-in fighting area, you will find Eranya, an imperial researcher investigating the legendary Goldbrand. She isn't very eager to tell you the location of it, on account of being dead, but by reading her journal you will find out the katana rests in Sivdur's Respite. Go to Sivdur's Respite, located to the north of Windhelm and you will be attacked by a few cultists of Boethiah, one of which will have a note detailing their ambitions. There is a gate with two pedestals on either side of it. Both pedestals have etched tablets. The left one states: ""I, Sivdur, warrior and defender of dragons, lie in rest here    My amulet, the symbol of my valor    Place it here so that I may have proof of my deeds in Sovngarde"" While the right one states: ""Forever my nemesis, Magrathi, high priest and slayer of my brother    His skull, the symbol of his betrayal    Place it here, away from his kinsman, so that he may never find peace"" On a table to the right of the pedestals lie Eranya's Notes on Sivdur's Tomb, which will tell you that her research notes were left at the Arcanaeum at the College of Winterhold. Go there and you will find Eranya's Research Notes located on the floor to the right of Urag gro-Shub's desk among some other books. Alternatively, you can go straight to the Arcanaeum at the College of Winterhold (or go there after reading Eranya's journal) and read the copy of Eranya's Research Notes. Once you've read Eranya's Research Notes, you will be attacked by two invisible Boethiah Cultists. Each of them will have a potion of invisibility. You will then need to find two artifacts to complete the quest: Sivdur's Amulet and Magrathi's Skull. They can be found in any order. Acquiring Sivdur's Amulet[edit] Visit Whiterun and convince Lars Battle-Born to give you Sivdur's amulet: I heard your dad gave you a very old, special amulet. Is that true? ""Ahh... yeah."" I need it. Would you give it to me? ""Go away."" Option  Dialogue   Hand over the amulet, or you won't like what comes next. (Intimidate) Passed: ""Don't hurt me! You win.""   I was going to use it to find a magic sword. Isn't that exciting? (Persuade) Passed: ""How can I argue with that?""   Would a few shiny septims change your mind? (Bribe) Passed: ""For that price? Sure."" Acquiring Magrathi's Skull[edit] Magrathi's Skull is a little bit more complicated than the amulet. Travel to Ivarstead and enter Shroud Hearth Barrow. If you have not cleared out the barrow beforehand, to the right of you, behind a gate, will be a ghost. That ghost is not related to this quest and you do not have to deal with him, but what self-respecting adventurer would pass up a chance for fame, riches and a word wall? Magrathi will be in the claw door chamber, past several traps, a copy of the Illusion skill book Before the Ages of Man and the ghost, and, unlike Lars Battle-Born will be reticent in giving you what you seek. He is a maskless Dragon Priest and will be just as powerful as any of the others no matter your level, so make sure you are prepared for the difficult fight ahead. After defeating him make sure to take his skull. Sivdur's Respite[edit] The two tablets and holders You will now need to head back to Sivdur's Respite. Place Sivdur's amulet on the pedestal to the left of the door and Magrathi's skull on the pedestal to the right of the door in order to proceed. The dungeon has some leveled draugr enemies and loot, but it is all of little note except for Sivdur's Tomb, where you will find Goldbrand on a pedestal and a chest near the entrance. When you pick up Goldbrand, two Honor Guards of Sivdur will get out of their sarcophagi, so be ready to fight them or run away; killing them is not necessary for the completion of the quest.

Making Up His Mind[edit] When you speak to Jarl Balgruuf, tell him you have a message from Ulfric. Balgruuf will take the axe, but whether or not the quest proceeds depends on if you've already finished Dragon Rising (and its prerequisite quests Before the Storm and Bleak Falls Barrow). If you've already done Dragon Rising then the quest will continue normally; otherwise Balgruuf will hold on to the axe and postpone making a decision about it until Dragon Rising is complete. With the time having come to give Ulfric an answer, Balgruuf will discuss the matter with his steward Proventus Avenicci and his housecarl Irileth. Balgruuf will state that he's not entirely happy with Imperial policy, but ultimately he'll decide to side with the Empire. He'll give the axe back to you and begin drafting a letter to negotiate with the Imperial Legion about garrisoning some of their troops in Whiterun. The Die is Cast[edit] Go back to Windhelm and return the axe to Ulfric. He'll be disappointed in Balgruuf's decision, but Galmar will welcome it; he's ready for battle and eager to launch the assault. After a short conversation, Ulfric will issue orders that initiate the next quest: Battle for Whiterun."

In Solitude, you may hear a rumor from innkeepers that a mad beggar is wandering around the streets of the city, distressed over the absence of his master, saying things like: ""Please, take pity on an old madman!"" and ""You! You'll help me! You help people, right? That's what you do?"" The beggar, named Dervenin, will plead you to find his master: ""My master has abandoned me! Abandoned his people. And nothing I say can change his mind. Now he refuses to even see me. He says I interrupt his vacation! It's been so many years... Won't you please help?"" He will tell you that his master was ""visiting a friend in the Blue Palace"" and further detail that his master ""went into the forbidden wing of the palace, to speak with an old friend"". He will give you Pelagius' Hip Bone, required to enter the forbidden wing. You also need to retrieve the key to the wing, either from one of the cleaning staff or from Falk Firebeard, the steward. Blue Palace[edit] Enter the Blue Palace and locate one of the cleaning staff. The key can be obtained from Erdi or Una by discussing the Pelagius Wing with her and telling her that Falk asked you to ""look into it"". You must pass an easy level, invisible Speech check to persuade her to give you the key. Alternatively, you can convince the castle steward to let you in if you have completed the quest The Man Who Cried Wolf. If you lack the respective requirement, the final dialogue option will not appear; the NPC will simply exit dialogue. Option  Falk Firebeard  Una  Erdi   I need to get into the Pelagius Wing.  Absolutely not. That wing has been sealed for hundreds of years, and for good reason. They say the ghost of Pelagius the Mad still haunts it. Ghost or not, there are reminders of his dark rule that are best left buried away.  Not on your life. It's dangerous in there, and Falk doesn't even like me and Erdi going in every year to clean out the spiders.  Oh, I'd get in trouble for that. It's not allowed. Besides, it's scary in there!   Falk, you know I'll be careful. (Falk Firebeard)Falk asked me to check it out. (Una and Erdi)  I'll make an exception for you, but do not bring anything out when you leave. Too many dark deeds transpired in those halls...  If you really want to... Just be careful of the ghost! He snuck up on me once and scared me sick. It took a week for me to feel better...  Well... I suppose in that case, it's okay to let you in. But only briefly. Be careful, and come right back! Exploring briefly in the wing will show it in a state of disrepair. Further travel will require you to walk through some spider webs before you suddenly find yourself transported into a strange realm. Pelagius' Mind[edit] ""It's all you've got."" You will find yourself suddenly wearing a full set of Fine Clothes with your inventory inaccessible and your abilities removed. The scene before you appears to be an extravagant dinner set in the middle of a misty wood and surrounded by stone archways. Two people are sitting at the table, one wearing a distinctive outfit and sitting on a throne, and the other a depressed man. The latter is Pelagius III who is complaining of various woes, although he sounds strangely sane, which delights the man across from him. Pelagius will leave after a short conversation during which the other man tries to cheer him up. Upon further investigation, it then transpires that the other individual is none other than Sheogorath himself. Tell him that you have a message for him and that he needs to come back from vacation. Sheogorath says he will leave if you can make your way out of Pelagius' mind. He will give you the Wabbajack to help you. There are three arches which lead to three separate trials, all of which must be completed. To the southeast is the Arch of Confidence, to the northeast is the Arch of Night Terrors and to the northwest is the Arch of Paranoia. These trials can be completed in any order. Pelagius' Confidence[edit] Pelagius' Anger beating up Pelagius' Confidence In this scene you will see Pelagius' Anger beating up Pelagius' Confidence. Confidence doesn't look like he is doing too well, since he is tiny and Anger is huge. Sheogorath wants you to tip the scales. Use the Wabbajack on Anger (casting twice) until he is tiny, and then on Confidence (again casting twice) until he is as big as Anger was. You must act quickly, as Confidence will shrink every time Anger hits him. During the battle, two spectral figures labeled Self Doubt will appear and begin to spar with each other. They do not seem to serve any purpose other than to get in your way as you attempt to complete the trial. Pelagius' Night Terrors[edit] Pelagius with his converted night terrors in the background You will see a bed in the middle of the forest with Pelagius sleeping on it. Sheogorath tells you that Pelagius has been suffering from night terrors since he was a child, and you are tasked with getting rid of them. Use the Wabbajack on Pelagius the Tormented to start the sequence, and then use it on each terror in turn as they arrive. After a successful attack with the Wabbajack each will turn into something more innocuous. Do not attack the innocuous creatures; instead, use the Wabbajack on Pelagius again to call the next terror. Repeat this process of zapping Pelagius and then the creatures that appear until he wakes up. Don't take too long in zapping the creatures after they appear, or you will have to start over. In order, the creatures or enemies that appear are: A wolf will appear (to be turned rather humiliatingly into a goat). A bandit chief will then appear, to be turned into a younger version of Pelagius. A hagraven will appear. After use of the Wabbajack, it will be turned into one of Pelagius' sultry maidens, from his early days. A flame atronach will appear. It turns into a bonfire after use of the staff. A dragon priest will appear, to be turned into an inaccessible chest behind the bonfire.  (The Dragon Priest may summon an atronach as well, but Wabbajack has no effect on it, so you should ignore it.) After all of the terrors have been converted, everyone will convene around the bonfire, and Sheogorath will communicate with you and ask you to progress to the next area. Pelagius' Paranoia[edit] Pelagius' Paranoia Through the Arch of Paranoia to the northwest is a small fort-like structure with steps leading up to the edge. In the middle of this structure there is an arena occupied by two fighting Storm Atronachs. Supposedly, one is yours and one is your opponent's, who is sitting opposite you with two other men. You are instructed to use Wabbajack to defeat your enemy. Don't bother zapping the atronachs themselves, as one will respond to the changes the other goes through, making the fight endless. Instead, aim for one of the two bodyguards sitting next to your opponent and Wabbajack them. Both of the men will turn into wolves and attack your opponent, killing him. Your Reward[edit] Go back to Sheogorath when you've finished his tasks and tell him you've fixed Pelagius' mind. He will summon Dervenin and return to the Shivering Isles, telling you to keep Wabbajack. He mentions his chamberlain, Haskill, as he prepares to depart, saying, ""Well, I suppose it's back to the Shivering Isles. The trouble Haskill can get into while I'm gone simply boggles the mind..."" You will then be transported back to the Pelagius Wing with all the items and powers you had when you started, as well as your new staff and clothes. Before leaving, move further down the hall and down the stairs to find a copy of the Lockpicking skill book Surfeit of Thieves."

The mine gets its name from the red mist filling the caverns and smelling like the sulfurous hot springs out in the volcanic tundra. The local blacksmith, Filnjar, will tell you the mine is not producing right now. In fact, the mine is currently overrun with spiders. Filnjar is worried that the invading arachnids will venture out of the mine looking for food soon. What's worse, the town guards are as useless as ""a fifth wheel on a wagon"" as they prefer to keep an eye out for enemy soldiers rather than trouble themselves protecting the town's major commodity. If you are willing to give Filnjar a hand, he will tell you, ""Keep to your word, and I'll line your pockets with as much as I can scrape up.""

Optional: Recruit Avulstein Gray-Mane as a follower. Journey to Northwatch Keep and rescue Thorald from his abductors. Return to Fralia Gray-Mane for your reward.","An Ongoing Feud[edit] A confrontation in the streets While in Whiterun, you will likely overhear an argument between Fralia Gray-Mane and two Battle-Borns, Idolaf and Olfrid, by her stall in the market. Olfrid: ""Foolish old woman! You know nothing! Nothing of our struggles, our suffering!"" Fralia: ""Nothing? And what of my son? Hmm? What of Thorald? Is he nothing? So don't talk to me about suffering!"" Idolaf: ""Your son chose his side, and he chose poorly. And now he's gone. Such is the way of war. The sooner you accept his loss, the better."" Fralia: ""I will never accept his death! My son still lives. I feel it in my heart. So tell me, Battle-Borns, where is he? Where are you holding my Thorald?"" Olfrid: ""Do you believe this old hag? ""Holding him""? Why I've got him in my cellar. He's my prisoner. Face it, cow! Your stupid son is dead! He died a Stormcloak traitor. And you... you best keep your mouth shut before you suffer the same."" Idolaf: ""Come on, father. There's nothing more to be said here."" If you talk to Idolaf or Olfrid about the argument they will explain about how the Battle-Borns and Gray-Manes had been friends once, but because of the ongoing civil war the families have had a falling out due to them taking opposing sides. After the argument is over proceed to talk to Fralia; she will say that Thorald isn't dead and when asked how she can be so sure of that fact will comment that it isn't safe to talk there and will ask you to meet her in her house later if you want to help. House Gray-Mane[edit] Avulstein Gray-Mane Head up the hill and enter House Gray-Mane where an armed man will rush at you, but Fralia calls out for him to stop; he is her son, Avulstein Gray-Mane, who has been hiding in the house for fear of being arrested by the Imperials if discovered. He tells you more of the story and what he wants done: ""I know that Thorald's not dead. I just know it. The Imperials have him, and are keeping him somewhere. But I don't know where. Those damned Battle-Borns... they know something. They're hiding it. They practically taunt us with it. They must have some sort of proof! There's got to be something in that house of theirs. I just know it. I don't dare leave the house myself. So I need your help."" Missing In Action[edit] The Battle-Borns' secret To find out what really happened to Thorald, you'll need to get your hands on an imperial missive in the possession of the Battle-Borns. There are three alternative ways to do so, each of which leverages a stealth skill: Lockpicking, Pickpocketing and Speech. Lockpicking method: You have to trespass in the Battle-Borns' house to retrieve the missive. It is located on the ground floor in a small office adjoining a bedroom; it is on the left from the front door. The office door is locked and there is no key for it; the key that can be pickpocketed from Battle-Born family members only opens the exterior doors. To simplify the task you can gain free access to the house by raising a resident's disposition, for example by helping Lars Battle-Born with his bullying problem, answering ""Battle-Born"" to your Idolaf's first ever greeting or by selling crops to Alfhild Battle-Born. The lock to the office door must be picked anyway, although sometimes a Battle-Born will have been in that room and left the door wide open. Pickpocket method: Jon Battle-Born carries a love letter from Olfina Gray-Mane. Pickpocket it from him, then talk to him about Thorald. He'll initially refuse to say much, but with the letter you can blackmail him into retrieving the missive and meeting you at the Talos statue to hand it over to you. Speech method: The quickest way is to pass a hard persuasion check (Speech level 75) with Idolaf Battle-Born. He'll tell you that the Gray-Manes are better off believing Thorald to be dead than knowing the truth. He once tried to look into the situation through his Legion contacts, as Thorald was once his friend, but was cut short. However he managed to find out that the Thalmor detain him at Northwatch Keep, a place people don't ever come back from. He will finally give you the missive as proof of his story. With the missive in your hands you may return to the Gray-Manes' to share what you discovered. If the door is locked, wait until Eorlund returns home at 9pm. Once you're inside, speak with Avulstein, who will propose to round up some men (Geirlund and Vidrald) to assault the fortress; you can agree to meet him there or tell him to stay put and let you handle it yourself. After making your decision, it's on to Northwatch Keep. Prisoner of War[edit] Northwatch Keep is occupied by Thalmor Guards, who will all turn hostile if you ignore the warnings to stay away. If you talk to the guard at the front entrance, you will have an option to ask for the release of Thorald. The guard will respond with, ""Are you joking? Even if we had a prisoner by that name, the only way he'd be released is by order of the Imperial Legion."" You can travel to Castle Dour in Solitude and talk to General Tullius, who will deny the request: ""The Thalmor? Do you have any idea what you're asking? I'm sorry, that's just not possible. It would cause far too many problems."" The peaceful method of solving the quest is incomplete, however, and cannot be pursued further. Once the diplomatic approach fails, return to Northwatch Keep and consider your remaining options. Avoid the patrolsStealthTo sneak in, enter the grounds through the back gate in the northeast section of the compound, then look to the right and pick the master-level door. Once inside, head down the stairs. Around the corner is a guard and an archer; one is patrolling while the other is sitting at a small table. They must be killed to safely escort Thorald out, and if you can do so quickly and quietly you should be able to prevent the guard in the next room from responding. Moving past the next guard and into the far room you will find the Northwatch Interrogator, who must also be killed to safely release Thorald. You won't need his Northwatch Keep key since you already unlocked the back door, but be sure to help yourself to the contents of the treasure chest. Speak to Thorald and he will be released from his shackles after a few moments to follow you, stopping to pick up a weapon along the way. Even though Thorald does not sneak, you can still slip by the previous guard who should still be oblivious to the jail break if you haven't made a lot of noise.    The garrisonAssaultThis is definitely the more profitable method, as the Thalmor soldiers at Northwatch will be equipped with leveled (steel, elven, glass) weapons and armor. If you opted to bring Avulstein with you, it is likely that Vidrald will die, and Geirlund is level 1 and essentially doomed. They wear leveled heavy and light armor respectively and carry leveled weapons. The haul taken from the dead Thalmor troops will be worth far more than your actual reward, and there's so much good loot available that you may wish to bring a follower to help you carry it all even if that's not normally your style. If you chose to let Avulstein come, then he and two mercenaries will be waiting for you behind some rocks near the fort; go talk to him and they'll begin their attack. There are four Northwatch guards patrolling the grounds and three Northwatch archers patrolling the walkways above who will all turn hostile when you enter the grounds. The fort is pretty straightforward once you're inside; just press on ahead and kill every elf in sight. You'll pass through a mess hall with a bar where you can find a copy of the One-handed skill book 2920, Morning Star, v1, and further on down in a small room on the bottom floor of a big room you can find a Thalmor mage carrying the Northwatch captain's key and the Two-handed skill book The Legendary Sancre Tor. As usual, keep an eye out for treasure chests along the way. The Interrogator[edit] The Northwatch Interrogator Near the end of the dungeon you'll reach a T-shaped intersection; to the left is the interrogation chamber where Thorald is being held, to the right is a cell block beyond which is the exit door. There are also racks of weapons in this area. Head left and kill the interrogator if you haven't done so already to get the Northwatch Keep key, then loot the big treasure chest and free Thorald. Lead him up through the cell blocks to the exit (you can release the prisoners here but they won't actually leave, though they will fight the Thalmor next door causing a distraction) and use the interrogator's key to unlock the door. Freedom![edit] Gray-Manes Reunited Once outside in a safe location, Thorald will thank you for releasing him, saying ""I cannot thank you enough for rescuing me from this place. I suspect I'd never again see the light of day otherwise. But why would you risk your life for me, a stranger?"" Once the details are explained he will ask you to get word to his mother and will give you a message that she should recognize. He'll then leave to join the Stormcloaks, as he doesn't feel safe in Whiterun anymore. If Avulstein is with you, they'll exchange a few words and he'll agree to follow Thorald; if not then Thorald will tell you that Avulstein should leave Whiterun too as the Thalmor will surely come looking for him (in which case Avulstein will already be gone by the time you get back to Whiterun). Return to Fralia and she'll ask you where Thorald is. After you tell her that he's not coming, she'll say ""What? After all this, I can't even see him? How... How do I know you're telling me the truth, and not just what I want to hear?"", giving you a chance to use the secret message ""suffer the winter's cold wind..."", which she completes: ""...for it bears aloft next summer's seeds."" That's my boy. So it's true, then. For now, it's enough to know that he's alive. I can find peace in that. Thank you, dear friend. You've given me back my son."" She'll then reward you with an enchanted weapon that Eorlund had made for Thorald. In the case that Eorlund is dead, she will instead give you 200 gold as a reward."

You learn that the jarl has put out a call for aid regarding the disappearance of a merchant, Gunther Frost-Foot, who was last seen in the area of Traitor's Post east of Windhelm. You will be tasked to go there and investigate. Traitor's Post, a destroyed cabin, is currently home to a gang of bandits led by a Breton female named Erwan. Upon killing Erwan, you will be prompted to loot her body and read her journal. Erwan, it seems, is quite disturbed, and currently considers the corpse of Gunther to be her ""best friend"". She mentions in passing that she sold a suit of Daedric mail to a Khajiit caravaner named Ma'dran, but that he should be willing to trade the armor for a ring she currently possesses. This ring is the Ring of Masser, which you will find on Gunther's naked corpse within the cabin. You will be prompted to track down Ma'dran, whose trade caravan travels between Windhelm and Solitude. You then have the choice of either trading the ring to him for a set of Daedric mail armor, or paying 5,000 gold for the armor. The ring has a base value of 5,211, so this is a fair trade if you don't wish to keep it.

Once you have breached the outer region of Mistwatch, find a lever located on the first level above ground. This will lower the bridge to enter the North tower. Once inside you will encounter a Nord named Christer. Speaking with him and accepting his request will initiate the quest. Entering the North Tower through any other entrance makes Christer inaccessible, as the room he is in requires the key he is holding to enter from the other side (see Notes at the end of the page for details). As you speak to him he will tell you that his wife Fjola is missing and believes she is being held here. According to his story the Mistwatch bandits started kidnapping and ransoming people around the time of her disappearance. He has managed to sneak in past the initial guards in the courtyard, but can't make it any further. That he hasn't been contacted by the bandits despite their ransom motives foreshadows a situation in which you will have to make a difficult decision should you choose to accept his quest. If you accept he will provide the key that is needed to unlock the gate leading to the rest of the tower. Past the locked door will be two leveled bandits and the ladder exit to the lower balcony. West Mistwatch Tower[edit] Trap door access to Mistwatch from the cliffs above. The West Mistwatch Tower has four leveled bandits who will ambush you immediately upon entry. There is a chest to the left of the first unlocked cell containing a dead Imperial, but this isn't Fjola. A note on the table next to the cell provides some insight into the situation. There are two bottles of Ale next to a lantern with a Long Taffy Treat on one table. You will find several beds scattered throughout the lower tier of the tower, as well as one more table with two bottles of Ale but nothing more of interest. Moving up the first flight of stairs you will encounter a table with a quiver of Dwarven Arrows next to a few drums and some food items. A final table with a kettle and an iron dagger marks the entry way to the Higher Balcony. East Mistwatch Tower[edit] The bandit leader approaches. The East Mistwatch Tower is through the upper balcony. Unlocking its door requires the Mistwatch Key given to you by Christer. Inside is a single room and only one person—a Bandit Leader. Instead of attacking, she will start talking to you, revealing that she is in fact Fjola. She was never kidnapped and the kidnappings only started happening after she disappeared because they were her idea. She will explain that she couldn't take her life anymore and quickly joined and whipped these bandits into shape when she returned to Skyrim. She still holds some sort of love for Christer and doesn't want him harmed, but doesn't want him in her life anymore. You will be presented with two options. Don't forget to pick up a copy of the Heavy Armor skill book Hallgerd's Tale from Fjola's dresser in her sleeping quarters, located just beyond where she approaches you in the east tower before leaving to make your decision. Kill the Bandit Leader[edit] One choice is to kill Fjola. You don't even have to hear Fjola's story. By killing her you are left with only a hint of her true identity given by the wedding band found on her corpse. At this point you need to return to Christer and tell him the bad news. If you do this, your only option will be to tell him that you killed Fjola because she attacked you, in which case he will become enraged and attempt to take revenge for her death. Trick Christer into Leaving[edit] The other choice is to agree to lie to Christer and get him to leave. Fjola gives you her wedding band as proof to present to Christer and tells you to keep it once he has left. You can tell Christer either that Fjola is dead or you only found her ring. Either way he is relieved, gives the ring back to you as reward, and takes off to start living again. You can complete the quest by telling Fjola that you have convinced Christer to leave — which only requires going a short distance up the stairs, because Fjola has followed you down into North Mistwatch Tower. She'll promise to return the favor one day in the future and the quest will end (including marking Mistwatch as cleared on your map)."

At the camp, you will find the body of a Dark Elf peddler who was apparently killed by Horkers. To start the quest, loot his body for the Peddler's Journal, which describes his interactions with a tribe of rieklings from an island to the north. The peddler was attempting to trade with the rieklings, who had mistaken his netch leather armor for food. They also made off with a book explaining how to craft netch leather armor, believing it to be a cookbook. Netch leather is of course highly toxic, which forced the peddler to begin importing regular leather from the mainland and dyeing it to fool the rieklings and prevent their untimely deaths. After reading the book, you will need to swim northward to the riekling camp to meet with the Riekling Tribe Leader. Unlike most of their kind, the rieklings on this island are non-hostile and will allow you to approach. Leather Delivery[edit] Straight from the source Riekling hunting party sketch The Tribe Leader is a riekling of few words. After a brief one-sided exchange, he will hand you a Riekling Hunting Party Sketch, a crude drawing which identifies the location of a hunting party sent to track down a Giant Bull Netch. At this point you will have several branching options for how to deal with the tribe. You can attempt to pass a Very Hard Persuasion check to convince the Tribe Leader that ingesting netch leather will kill him and that he should give you the crafting book. If you can't manage to convince him, your only option if you wish to save the rieklings is to use a tanning rack to create Imitation Netch Leather, by combining regular leather with charcoal and a purple mountain flower. This can then be given to the Tribe Leader to progress the quest. Alternatively, you can track down the hunting party along the coast just east of the Sun Stone. You will arrive to find a party of rieklings engaged in battle with a family of netches (the Giant Bull Netch along with a Giant Betty Netch and a Netch Calf). Both sides are protected so it will be up to you to deliver the killing blows and decide the battle. You can kill the rieklings in order to save the netch, or you can join in and claim the Giant Bull Netch Leather for yourself. You can then deliver the leather to the Tribe Leader to progress the quest. It is possible to obtain both the Giant Bull Netch Leather and the Imitation Netch Leather and decide which you want to give to the tribe. You can also just attack the Rieklings and loot the Tribe Leader's corpse. Whichever choice you make, you will be rewarded with a key which unlocks a nearby chest containing the book Crafting with Netch Leather as well as a full set of Painted Netch Leather armor. Loot the contents to complete the quest. Crafting with Netch Leather[edit] The optional chest in Fort Hraggstad Although the quest completes once you loot the chest, you will be given a miscellaneous objective to read the crafting book. Doing so will give you two further objectives: the option to either craft your own set of Netch Leather armor, or to instead track down a shipment somewhere in Fort Hraggstad. It is advisable to search Fort Hraggstad for a full set rather than crafting your own, as the chest is located just inside the fort's main entrance and contains an additional unique item, the Boots of Blinding Speed. This artifact is legendary for the extreme speed at which it allows the wearer to travel, although unfortunately it curses you with total blindness while equipped. This can be somewhat negated through the use of Night Eye. Once you've obtained a set of Netch Leather armor, both objectives will complete."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Moss_Mother_Cavern_(quest)","Travel to Moss Mother Cavern. Speak to Valdr directly outside of it. Give Valdr anything he can use to help heal himself or heal him yourself. Help Valdr clear the spriggans out of Moss Mother Cavern, or do it alone.","Spriggan Ambush[edit] The first time you approach Moss Mother Cavern, Valdr will call out for your attention. He explains that he was attacked by spriggans living in the cave and needs immediate medical attention or he'll die from the spriggan's curse. After helping him, he will further explain that his companions had tracked an injured bear sow to the cave and were ambushed by the spriggans as they entered to kill it. Valdr was the only one to escape as Ari and Niels were killed before they could flee. He'll ask for your help to avenge his friends by killing the creatures. Vengeance[edit] Valdr will offer to help you clear the caves. He uses a bow and becomes protected if he follows you inside the cave. If you don't want to risk him dying, you can offer to clear the cave alone. There are three leveled spriggans and a single leveled bear. The bear and a spriggan will be near the entrance; the other two spriggans are near the pool. It's possible to engage them individually; any sort of fire damage helps tremendously, though you may need to bring potions to mitigate their high damage output and ability to fully heal themselves. When all the spriggans are dead, Valdr will thank you and give you his lucky dagger which has a 25% chance to critically hit. He states he will return to Falkreath after he finishes burying his friends. Search the cave for a few scattered pieces of loot, including leveled boots, shield and a one-handed weapon. See Moss Mother Cavern for more details."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mourning_Never_Comes","Speak to Muiri. (Optional) Kill Nilsine Shatter-Shield. Travel to Raldbthar and kill Alain Dufont. Return to Muiri for your reward.","Let the Mourning Begin[edit] After completing at least one of Nazir's contracts, returning to the Sanctuary will trigger a scene where a seemingly annoyed Astrid reluctantly welcomes Cicero to the hideout. As Nazir will deny you any rewards before you speak to Astrid, let the conversation finish and then wait for her to approach you. She will hand you the first real job for the Brotherhood: Markarth resident Muiri wants an ex-lover killed. Astrid asks you to show professionalism and explains that you can keep the entire reward, as this is your first contract. In Markarth, Muiri will be at work in The Hag's Cure during the day and hanging out in the Silver-Blood Inn in the evening. Approach her and witness her surprise that the Dark Brotherhood actually still exists and that the Sacrament worked. She then explains the story of how she was once a very close friend of the Shatter-Shield family in Windhelm until she met womanizer Alain Dufont. Alain managed to seduce her but, as it turned out, used her to get close to the Shatter-Shield family and rob them blind. The love affair ended with Muiri being kicked out in the cold by the family and Dufont abandoning her, eventually rejoining his bandit colleagues inside Raldbthar. Muiri understandably wants Alain dead, but will make a second request once you arrive, promising to raise the reward if carried out. Muiri wants Nilsine Shatter-Shield assassinated as well, as an act of revenge on the family. Recently the Shatter-Shield family lost youngest daughter Friga to a serial killer and their mourning process was part of Dufont's plan and the very reason he seduced Muiri. The family held Muiri responsible and refused to talk to her ever again. Muiri now reasons they may see just how wrong it was to kick her out if their only remaining daughter dies. You automatically accept the task, but it is optional. Asking her for elaboration will net you two samples of poisonous lotus extract, which may come in handy. Nilsine[edit] Note: If you have yet to trigger the quest Blood on the Ice, do so before killing Nilsine Shatter-Shield. See this section for details. If there is a dead woman lying near the Windhelm Hall of the Dead, then Blood on the Ice has been triggered. Windhelm's citizens know of the tragedy that recently hit the wealthy Shatter-Shield family and will often talk about the serial killer's first victim, Friga Shatter-Shield. When speaking to the grieving parents, Tova and Torbjorn, both will express great sadness, especially Tova. Unaware that Muiri plans her revenge, the family, including your target Nilsine Shatter-Shield, tries to move on in life. Nilsine roams around town all day long: browsing the market in the morning, standing near her sister's now-abandoned house, Hjerim, in the afternoon, and spending her evenings inside the Hall of the Dead on weekdays and in the Temple of Talos on weekends. It is not possible to trigger her anger during conversation, so a stealthy kill when she is alone in the evening is preferable. When the deed is done, move on to the real target, Alain Dufont, or return to Muiri in Markarth. Killing Nilsine will cause her already bereaved mother, Tova, to commit suicide in their clan home in Windhelm. Raldbthar[edit] Alain Dufont and one of his guards Raldbthar is a Dwemer ruin located on the snowy mountainside east of Korvanjund, past Shearpoint. It is one of the three entrances to Blackreach. The target, however, has taken up residence in the first zone, so the trek will not be long. A few bandit enemies patrol near the entrance, so dispose of them, enter the ruin, and fight another bandit inside. Near the first intersection, the inhabitants have been creative with one of the ancient fire traps and a charred skeever will slowly cook when it activates. The path straight ahead is hindered by said fire trap and a leveled lock. For a better chance of a surprise attack, take the eastern tunnel and kill a few bandits along the way. Down the last set of stairs is where Alain Dufont resides, so consider entering sneak mode as you descend. There's a group of three bandits in the chamber and a fourth bandit hidden behind the southern gate. There is an oil slick on the ground that you may take advantage of by using a fire spell to roast the opposition, the unarmored Alain included. Fighting them normally is also an option, but beware of Alain's weapon of choice, the unique and enchanted warhammer Aegisbane. When Alain is dead, the quest will update. Return to Muiri or, if you have yet to optionally kill Nilsine and still wish to do so, head to Windhelm. Reward[edit] When you return to Muiri in Markarth, she will show no remorse whatsoever and will hand you gold for taking care of her ex-lover. If you chose to kill Nilsine Shatter-Shield, you will receive a leveled amount of gold and the unique Muiri's Ring which boosts the strength of potions by 15%. Otherwise, you will only receive 100 gold. Completing the optional objective will also allow you to marry Muiri. Back in the Sanctuary, Astrid will thank you for a job well done and proceed to show greater paranoia concerning Cicero and his insanity. She will finish the quest by asking you to do her a favor, starting the next quest Whispers in the Dark."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:New_Allegiances","Go to the specified location. Turn the target into a vampire. Report back to Vingalmo.","When asking what can be done to help around Volkihar Keep, you may be directed to Vingalmo. Speak to him, and he will tell you: ""I've found a new candidate, ripe for Harkon's Gift. I'm sending you to welcome this soul into our family."" Depending on who the target is, he will go on to say one of three things: ""Haran manages the inn in Winterhold. A forsaken place under the shadow of the mages guild. She will help us keep an eye on the mages. ""Valindor of Riften has his ears in places that we'd love to listening in. Joining our family should increase our possibilities in the south."" ""A pathetic creature in her present condition, but the gift will embolden her. And her lowly state suits her to being our eyes and ears in Markarth."" He then instructs you: Put her/his mind to rest, allay her/his fear through vampiric seduction and when she/he is in a pliant condition, embrace her/him and bite her/him on the neck."" Additional questions on various subjects will be available before setting out: What do you mean by allaying fear through vampiric seduction? ""Our blood grants us power to calm and relax. If you currently lack the gift, forgo feeding for a day and that power will come naturally.Once your thrall is suitable sedated, you will be able to impart the gift without resistance."" Can't anyone become a vampire if bitten by one? ""While the blessed state of undeath can be 'accidentally' conferred - consider the brutish creatures you find wailing in dank hovels in the wild...Only those who can trace their ancestry through Harkon's mortal blood line [sic] can faithfully accept the power conferred by his Vampiric blood.And among those, it seems, only when the heavens show the correct aspects.I have found such a soul and the stars appear cooperative."" Why am I able to bestow the gift of Harkon's blood? ""Because he himself bestowed upon you a portion of his vitality when he infused you with his own blood the night you returned with Serana.A small measure of his blood now and forever flows through your veins."" Understood. ""When you offer the embrace, do so away from prying eyes. Our new sibling will then likely require rest while his/her blood undergoes the change. Return to me when your part is done."" In this quest you are required to infect either Haran, Valindor, or Cairine, earning their allegiance to the Volkihar Vampire Clan. Vingalmo suggests that you use Vampire's Seduction to ease the process, but biting the target while they are asleep will also work. Valindor[edit] Valindor can be found in Riften and starts off his day by waking up at 4am and having a long breakfast for two hours in his house. At 10pm, he returns to his house to sleep for six hours until 4am, and repeats his schedule the following day. Cairine[edit] Cairine can be found in Markarth and spends her entire day at the Warrens. She rarely sleeps, and instead sits on the ground, making her an easy target. Haran[edit] Haran can be found in Winterhold at the inn. At 2am, she sleeps in the inn's cellar along with her daughter, Eirid. Once you have bitten your target, they will be part of the Clan. Return to Vingalmo to complete the quest."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:A_New_Debt","Be informed of your inherited debt by Mogrul.

Situation? What kind of situation? ""Drovas Revli [sic] owes me 1000 septims. At least he did until you set him up with that Telvanni wizard. Now he's untouchable.

He will follow you out of town if you are patient and don't run too far ahead, allowing you to discreetly dispatch him without drawing the guards' ire. You can also visit Drovas and inform him of Mogrul's harassment.

Upon arriving in the courtyard, you will find Isran, Celann, Durak, and newcomer Vori doing their best to fight a group of attacking vampires. Help them defeat the vampires, then report back to Isran who will be waiting at the main gate, showing great anger that his hidden fortress was exposed so soon. When you tell him that the vampires were looking for a woman trapped inside Dimhollow Crypt, he will say: ""A woman? Trapped in there? That doesn't make any sense. Who is she? More importantly, where is she?"" However, he will forget about the woman once you tell him the vampires claimed an Elder Scroll: ""By the Divines, this couldn't get much worse. This is more than you and I can handle."" He will then realize it is time to bring in some powerful reinforcements to Fort Dawnguard: ""If they're bold enough to attack us here, then this may be bigger than I thought. I have good men here, but... There are people I've met and worked with over the years. We need their skills, their talents, if we're going to survive this. If you can find them, we might have a chance."" He will then tell you about the two persons, namely Sorine Jurard and Gunmar: ""I think we'll want Sorine Jurard. Breton girl, whip-smart and good with tinkering. Fascination with the Dwemer. Weapons in particular. Last I knew, she was out in the Reach, convinced she was about to find the biggest dwarven ruins yet. You'll also want to find Gunmar. Big brute of a Nord, hates vampires almost as much as I do. Got it into his head years back that his experience with animals would help. Trolls in particular, from what I hear."" He will then send you on your way, and you will have to convince Sorine and Gunmar to join the Dawnguard, and use their special skills to help out against the vampire menace. Gunmar[edit] Gunmar fighting the bear Gunmar will show up randomly in the wilderness in Skyrim or, if you have installed Dragonborn, on Solstheim, or somewhere else with Creation Club content (see notes). Follow your map marker to his location, and you will find the huge Nord in sneaking position, seemingly on the hunt for game, warning you: ""Mind yourself. There's a vicious bear on the loose."" He then explains that he has chased a bear for two weeks, and that he finally managed to corner it. Keep in mind, if there is not a map marker in mainland Skyrim, check Solstheim. When you tell him that Isran needs his help, he will forget the bear for a while: ""Isran? Needing someone else's help? Never thought I'd hear that. I'm afraid he's a few years too late. I've moved on. I have more important business to attend to. Besides, he can handle anything alone! He assured me so himself. What could he possibly need my help with?"" When you tell him about the vampire threat and the Elder Scroll, he will reconsider, although he wants you to help him track down the bear and kill it. He will then lead you to a cave near his initial starting point: Possible locations: Bonechill Passage • Bronze Water Cave • Brood Cavern • Clearspring Tarn • Cronvangr Cave • Crystaldrift Cave • Fallowstone Cave • Honeystrand Cave • Horker IslandDB • Pinepeak Cavern • White Ridge BarrowDB There is always one specific bear you will have to kill, although you will often get in battle with several creatures at once. When the bear is dead, a journal update will tell you to speak with Gunmar, who will thank you for the assistance, and agree to help against the vampires: ""You've helped me, so I suppose the least I can do is find out what Isran wants. He's still at that fort near Stendarr's Beacon, I assume?"" He will then be on his way to Fort Dawnguard. Sorine Jurard[edit] Sorine Jurard Sorine Jurard will turn up in the wilderness near an unmarked Dwemer convector, just south of Mor Khazgur. She will be drifting around, obviously looking for something, mumbling: ""What would mudcrabs want with my satchel, anyway?"" and ""Just one gyro. One, and I can get back to work. Where are they?"" When you talk to her, she will ask if you have seen a sack full of Dwemer gyros and will proceed to tell you that a mudcrab may have taken it. When you tell her that Isran needs her help, she will respond: ""Isran? Wants me? No, you must be mistaken. He made it exceedingly clear the last time we spoke that he had no interest in my help. I find it hard to believe he's changed his mind. He said some very hurtful things to me before I left."" When told about the vampire threat and the Elder Scroll, she will change her mind, although she will not do anything before she gets a Dwemer gyro. You can now choose between two options, although the second option will differ if you already have a Dwemer gyro in your inventory. If you do, you can hand it to her and she will be on her way to Fort Dawnguard. You can also choose to persuade her, although you need a Speech skill of 50+ to be successful. If everything else fails, you can look around for her satchel. To find it, starting at Sorine, first face southeast. In this direction, you can see a tree near the water. Travel to the tree. After reaching it, face west. From here, you can see the satchel on the ground a few feet away. When you return to her with one of the gyros she will finally be convinced and walk all the way to Fort Dawnguard for an encounter with Isran. Isran's Speech[edit] When you return to Fort Dawnguard, you will see that Isran has tightened security and made several changes to the exterior, including a gate and more wooden barricades. Enter the fort and you will find Gunmar and Sorine in the main hall, with Isran looking down at them from the balcony above. Before long, Isran will seal off the chamber, trapping the two new recruits, and shower them both with concentrated sunlight as a test. The following conversation will take place: Gunmar: ""All right Isran, you've got us all here. Now what do you want?"" Isran: ""Hold it right there."" Sorine: ""What are you doing?"" Isran: ""Making sure you're not vampires. Can't be too careful. So, welcome to Fort Dawnguard. I'm sure you've heard a bit of what we're up against. Powerful vampires, unlike anything we've seen before. And they have an Elder Scroll. If anyone is going to stand in their way, it's going to be us."" Sorine: ""This is all well and good, but do we actually know anything about what they're doing? What do we do now?"" Isran: ""We'll get to that. For now, get acquainted with the space. Sorine, you'll find room to start your tinkering on that crossbow design you've been working on. Gunmar, there's an area large enough for you to pen up some trolls, get them armored up and ready for use. In the meantime, we're going to get to the bottom of why a vampire showed up here looking for you. Let's go have a little chat with it, shall we?"" Once Isran has removed the barrier, the quest will end and the next quest, Prophet, will initiate. Gunmar and Sorine will then find their respective spots in the western area of Fort Dawnguard. Their presence will net you several benefits. Sorine is a master trainer in Marksman, and will also sell and buy items. She will also hand you several quests, while Gunmar is a master trainer in Smithing, will sell and buy weapons and armor, and will sell you an armored troll to aid you in battle. The next time you visit Fort Dawnguard, Sorine and Gunmar will change into their Dawnguard armor, a blacksmith's forge and arcane enchanter will be found near the smithing area, and armored trolls can be found in the pen across from the smelter. Exiting to Dayspring Canyon (including all 3 balconies) and re-entering from there will suffice."

""Something isn't right, Fanari."" Fanari: ""Deor, you must be calm. I'm sure there's a good reason Baldor left us."" Deor: ""Something isn't right, Fanari.

If you won't help me, then I'll ask the All-Maker to send someone else who can."" If you ask Fanari about the missing person, she will just brush it off as another of Deor's crazy ideas, but Deor is quite serious. He will tell you that local blacksmith Baldor Iron-Shaper went missing in the middle of the night. Deor suspects a kidnapping motivated by Baldor's valuable expertise in stalhrim smithing. On the night of his disappearance Deor also saw two elves dragging something away to the ""south and west"", so start your search in that direction. Abandoned Lodge[edit] The abducted blacksmith While Deor's directions could lead you more-or-less anywhere on Solstheim, your compass objective marker will point you directly to an Abandoned Lodge southwest of the Temple of Miraak. The lodge is normally empty, but once you arrive, you'll be attacked by four hostile members of the Thalmor. Dispose of them and loot their bodies for a note from their commander and the key to the lodge. Inside, head into the basement where you will find the scared, tied-up smith in a corner, weeping: ""Help! Somebody! Please, someone, help me!"" and ""I have been taken against my will! I am in need of rescue!"" When you talk to Baldor, he will remember you as the hero who rescued the people of Skaal Village. Despite his wounds, he'll claim he's not hurt. When you ask why the Thalmor abducted him, he'll reply: ""I do not know this word Thalmor, but if you mean the elves, they were trying to learn the secrets of forging Stalhrim. Their leader, an elf named Ancarion, has a map. He says that it shows the location of a hidden source of Stalhrim."" He will then explain what stalhrim is: ""Enchanted ice as hard as iron and cold as death. Stalhrim can be forged into deadly weapons, but the art is known only to smiths of the Skaal."" He will then point you towards a Thalmor ship at the northwestern coast where Ancarion resides. He asks you to retrieve the map as it belongs to the Skaal people. Leave the wounded smith behind and make your way northwest to Northshore Landing. Northshore Landing[edit] When you arrive, a Thalmor soldier will warn you to be careful. Make your way to the ship, and talk to Ancarion. I'm here about the Stalhrim map. ""So you know my purpose here, then? I suppose you must have found that dullard of a blacksmith.

Pass: Receive map and a new questFail: Combat If the Thalmor soldiers at the dock engage you in combat, you'll need to kill Ancarion and loot the map from his corpse. Regardless if he gave you the map, if you pickpocketed it from him, or if you killed him and looted it from his corpse, your final step is to return to Skaal Village and give it to Baldor. He will be quite pleased, and will teach you how to smith Stalhrim. This quest is now complete, and the next two will start when you return to Skaal Village."

Return to Ironback Hideout and enter the cellar for your reward.","Kragrash the Vampire Hunter[edit] The quest starts when you read Kragrash's letter at Ironback Hideout, a remote bandit camp high in the mountains of Haafingar. This location can be quite difficult to reach as it only has one approach. Defeat the bandits camped out at the hideout and locate Kragrash's Letter on the table inside the ruined house (it may be difficult to see). Searching the hideout, you may come across a new trapdoor beneath a tent. This trapdoor has been added by the Creation and is locked for now. Claim Kragrash's crossbows for yourself The letter reveals that Ironback Hideout used to be occupied by an Orcish vampire hunter named Kragrash. He contracted vampirism and subsequently became suicidal, hiking east into the mountains to watch one final sunrise before he turned. In his letter, he invites you to seek him out and claim his vampire hunting equipment. You will need to travel to the nearby Thalmor Embassy to find Kragrash's final resting place. To the south of the embassy's entrance, you will come upon a burnt corpse on the edge of a cliff; this is the remains of Kragrash, who apparently covered himself in Dwarven oil and ensured that he would be burnt up in the sunlight. Loot his corpse to find the Ironback Hideout Cellar Key which can be used on the trapdoor back at Ironback Hideout. Reward[edit] With the key, you will have the ability to enter Ironback Hideout Cellar, a remarkably well-preserved base of operations containing a vault filled with vampire hunting equipment. The quest will end once you enter the cellar, but you are free to unlock the vault and loot everything within. A Silver sword and greatsword can be found here. Laid out on a table you will find an Ebony Crossbow, an Elven Crossbow, and several Exploding Dwarven Bolts of Fire and Shock. These two powerful crossbows are the main reward for this quest, and can be enhanced using the nearby anvil."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:A_Night_To_Remember","Meet Sam Guevenne and accept the drinking contest. Help clean up the Temple of Dibella. Ask about Sam and the staff in Rorikstead. Talk to Ysolda in Whiterun about the staff. Head to Morvunskar. Search Morvunskar for Sam and the staff. Receive your reward from the Daedric Lord Sanguine.","Drinking Competition[edit] Once you reach level 14, you may meet Sam Guevenne in any inn or tavern. He will challenge you to a drinking contest, offering to award you a staff if you win. Sam reaches his limit after his second drink. You can win by taking a third drink, after which a drunken Sam declares you the winner. However, before awarding the staff, Sam wants to take his new drinking buddy to ""a place where the wine flows like water"". At this point your mental blackout begins and the screen fades to black until the next day. The Hangover[edit] ""Wake up! That's right, it's time to wake up, you drunken blasphemer!"" You will be woken by Senna, a priestess, in the temple of Dibella in Markarth. When you ask about what happened, she states you were blathering about a wedding and a goat, or blaspheming the statuaries by fondling. You apparently made quite a mess of the temple, so she asks you to clean up the temple and make amends. Option  Dialogue   Was a man named Sam with me? Dibella teaches love and compassion, but that doesn't mean we're just going to tell you what you want to know and let you walk away from this. Pick up your mess, then apologize, and if we think you're sincere we'll consider lending you aid.   I'm sorry, I don't even remember how I got here. (Persuade) Passed: Well, you were deep in your cups when you got here. You were ranting but most of it was slurred. You said something about Rorikstead.Failed: Oh, I'd love to help you figure it out, but I'm so busy cleaning up the mess you made of our temple... Now if you were to help tidy up and perhaps apologize afterwards... I might be able to help you.   Tell me how I got here and I'll pay for the damages. (Bribe) Passed: Well, we can always use contributions. You were ranting when you got here but most of it was slurred. You did say something about Rorikstead . Maybe you should take a look there.Failed: Oh you must be nobility of some sort. Running around partying and paying others to clean it up. I don't think so. Clean up your own mess. If you apologize, you will learn a little bit more information about what happened. You will have to pick up several seemingly meaningless items, namely, a giant's toe, two bottles of Alto Wine, and a confusing note from Sam. According to the note, you need these items, now marked as quest items, and a Hagraven Feather to fix the staff you were promised. You can skip the cleanup through persuasion (Average, Speech Skill 50) or bribe. Note that the Shrine of Dibella in the same room will grant you a +10 Speechcraft blessing for 8 hours, which can potentially help you for all stages of this quest. If you avoid cleaning up, you need not worry about trying to get the items. After you clean up the temple, the priestess tells you that when you got there you were saying something about Rorikstead.  Grok and a Goat[edit] Grok won't let go of Gleda ... Head on to Rorikstead and when you arrive, look for Ennis. He will indignantly rebuke you for stealing his prized goat, named Gleda, and selling her to a giant. To get the information you need about Sam and the staff, you can pay Ennis 1000 gold for the goat, persuade him, intimidate him, or simply retrieve his goat. Option  Dialogue   What happened with Gleda again? I'm a little fuzzy on that. You really don't remember stealing a goat and selling her to a Giant? Are you thick? Go get her! At least she's bound to follow you back - you smell just like the fermented feed she likes.   Did I say anything about where I left a staff? You mentioned something like that... when you were running off with my goat! Tell you what - you bring back my goat, and maybe I'll give a damn about your staff.   Help me retrace my steps and I'll pay you for the goat. (1000 gold) Passed: Fine, but I'll still be missing my Gleda. Doubt I'll ever have a prize winning goat again. Most of what you said was gibberish but you left a note. The only bit I could read was ""after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.""Failed: There's not enough money in the world to replace Gleda.   Tell me everything and you won't end up like your goat. (Intimidate) Passed: Okay, okay. Most of what you said didn't make sense but you left a note. The only bit that I could read said ""after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun."" That's all I know.Failed: Do what you have to do, I'm not giving up on Gleda.   I need to find Sam and the staff, in order to get Gleda back. (Persuade) Passed: I suppose that makes sense. You didn't mention a Sam and nothing you said about the staff made sense. You left a note but it was mostly gibberish, the only bit I could make out was ""after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.""Failed: You didn't seem to need either to sell Gleda to the Giant in the first place. I think you'll figure it out. To get Gleda, head south to find the goat wandering around near a giant named Grok. The giant is non-hostile, but once you get the goat to follow you, Grok will decide to attack. It is possible to steal Gleda without incurring Grok's wrath if you sneak up and ""talk"" to Gleda and then immediately run before Grok notices you, or yield to Grok if he does attack you. Gleda will follow you no matter how fast you run. Another option is to cast Calm on Grok before engaging with Gleda. Grok will not care that you have taken Gleda for the duration of the spell. If you are skilled enough, you can kill Grok. Lead the goat back to Ennis to learn that you mentioned something about paying Ysolda in Whiterun for a wedding ring.  The Blushing Bride[edit] ... and Moira won't let go of the wedding ring Go to Whiterun and find Ysolda. She says that you bought a wedding ring on credit from her, but since there isn't going to be a wedding, she wants the ring back. Your options are much the same as earlier conversations: you can persuade or intimidate her to get the information about Sam, pay her 2000 gold for the ring, or find the ring. Option  Dialogue   Seriously, let me pay you for the ring. (2000 gold) Passed: Decided to go through with it then? I knew you couldn't have forgotten about your fiance [sic]. You spoke of her so glowingly. I don't know much about Morvunskar but it sounded like a lovely place for the ceremony. Congratulations.Failed: I think I would prefer my ring back. I put a lot of time into making it and you just gave is [sic] away as a joke.   I just need to get to the wedding. Please. (Persuade) Passed: You must have had a wild night if you can't remember that. But I suppose everyone gets the jitters before their wedding. And I did say you could take a bit of time paying me back. You said the ceremony was going to be at Morvunskar. Don't forget you still owe me!Failed: I'm sure your bride-to-be will tell you when you [sic] where the ceremony will be. If she still wants to marry you when you tell her you can't afford the ring.   I don't care about the ring! Tell me what else I said! (Intimidate) Passed: All right, all right. You're mean when you're sober. You said you [sic] the ceremony was going to be in Morvunskar. You said your friend Sam was going to be your best man.Failed: You think you can bully me. I grew up with five brothers. Go... get...my...ring.   What was that story about my fiancee [sic]? How could you forget? It was the sweetest story I'd ever heard. You met at the full moon, under the biggest tree in Witchmist Grove, surrounded by fireflies. It was straight out of a storybook. If you choose to get the ring, find your ""fiancée"", Moira the hagraven, who awaits you at her hut in Witchmist Grove: ""Darling! I've been waiting for you to return, to consummate our love!"" Your only option is to ask for the ring back. Moira gets mad and turns hostile: ""What? You want it for that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers – don't you? I won't let her have you!"" Kill her and take the wedding ring from her inventory. Once you have the ring, return to Whiterun and give it to Ysolda to learn where you were going to have the ceremony: Morvunskar.  The ""Perfect"" Wedding Location[edit] Entering the Misty Grove ""You're here! I was beginning to think you might not make it."" Having learned of the wedding's location, head over to Morvunskar. You will find a lot of hostile mages both outside and inside there. Fight your way into the fort. Eventually, after descending one, then ascending another stairway, a ball of blue light will appear. Enter the light and you will be transported to Misty Grove. Follow the path and you will find a party already in full swing, including your drinking buddy Sam. Sam will eventually reveal that he is actually the Daedric Prince of Debauchery, Sanguine. He will tell you that he was introducing some merriment and subversion into the world and was encouraging you to go out and ""have fun"". The items he had you bring to repair the staff, it turns out, are pointless, and will no longer be quest items. Sanguine will reward your efforts to track him down with the Sanguine Rose and will teleport you back to the pub where you met him."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nimhe,_the_Poisoned_One","Talk to Calcelmo in Understone Keep. Kill Nimhe, a giant frostbite spider.","The Scholar[edit] Calcelmo, an accomplished scholar and author, is the owner and curator of the private Dwemer museum and the associated Nchuand-Zel archaeological dig site. Should you wish to enter either of these locales, you must go through Calcelmo. He spends his time at the arcane enchanter set up across the underground river from the entrance to the Nchuand-Zel excavation site. Talk to him about his work, and he will inform you that he has been placed in charge of curating artifacts extracted from Nchuand-Zel, an ancient Dwemer castle located deep within the mountain behind Understone Keep. He mentions his excavation efforts being thwarted by the presence of Nimhe, a giant frostbite spider that is blocking the entrance to Nchuand-Zel. He asks you to kill the spider in exchange for access to both his Dwemer museum and the site itself. Nchuand-Zel[edit] The entrance to the Nchuand-Zel excavation site is a large metal door at the top of a short flight of stairs directly across the stone bridge from where Calcelmo's arcane enchanter is set up. Once inside, you will encounter a set of two square rooms connected to each other, with staircases on all sides of each room. All staircases are blocked by crumbled stone except the one at the far left, which provides access to the excavation site. After proceeding through a short passage, you will descend into an area which is still under excavation (mostly dirt and wooden scaffolding), and encounter two or three frostbite spiders. After killing these, you will proceed a little deeper into the excavation area, where you will come across a seemingly dead end, with webs on part of the wall. Look closely and you will see that some of the webbing is blocking a passage. Cut through the webs to provide access to the passage, which leads to a room with a raised stone walkway with stairs at the opposite end, covered with spider webs. If you look up, you will see the large webbed hole in the ceiling through which Nimhe will descend once you approach. Cleaning House[edit] Dispatching of Nimhe may prove difficult within the tight quarters, since there is very little room to maneuver in order to pull back from her attacks. An option is to retreat back down the corridor from which you came and attack Nimhe with ranged weapons or spells, as she cannot fit in the passage. Once the deed is done, search through more webbing at the top of the stone walkway to find the body of Alethius, and clues leading to another quest within Nchuand-Zel. Once you inform Calcelmo of the giant spider's demise he will award you the key to Nchuand-Zel as well as the Dwemer Museum key, allowing access at any time. Following the completion of this quest, the various Dwemer metal parts on the two tables near Calcelmo and his nephew may now be taken without consequence."

Brutius and the two bandits are all mages and will use magic attacks against you. Once you have dispatched of the ambushers, loot the bandits who both have a full set of vagrant robes on and then search Brutius for his journal.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:No_News_is_Good_News","Talk to Angeline Morrard in Angeline's Aromatics. Get some news from Captain Aldis. Return to Angeline Morrard.","A Mother's Request[edit] Angeline Morrard is the shopkeeper of Angeline's Aromatics in Solitude. In your conversation with her, she will ask you if you have been to Whiterun. If you tell her that you haven't been there before, she will be understanding and you can talk to her about it later. If you tell her that you have indeed been to Whiterun, she will become very animated. It seems her daughter, Fura, was assigned to Whiterun after she joined the Imperial Army and Angeline was hoping to get some recent news about her. Although Angeline has tried contacting Captain Aldis, she didn't get any information from him. If you are willing to help her get more information about her daughter, anything you can find out would be welcome. A Need To Know Basis[edit] Captain Aldis can be found training the guards in the courtyard of Castle Dour during the day. When you tell him that Angeline sent you for information about her daughter, Aldis will respond, ""Generally posting information is need to know only"". Several options are available for you to continue the conversation, including persuasion and intimidation. You must pass an easy Speech check to persuade him to reveal Fura's fate.

The whiterun [sic] legate, he needed to know the Stormcloak positions. He sent out a party to scout the area. They happened upon a large force... I'm told none of them made it back. Private Morrard... Angela's [sic] daughter was in that scouting party. She needs to be told"". The Bearer of Bad News[edit] Return to Angeline Morrard with the news. Angeline is eager to hear about her daughter. She is understandably grief-stricken when you tell her the bad news: ""I told her. I told her the imperial [sic] army would kill her. That this was a war of Jarls and Imperial Generals and we had no part in it. She just wouldn't hear it"". Angeline can't thank you for the news, ""not for this"", but she acknowledges that you have done her a service.

Your journal will inform you that you must find Madanach, also known as the King in Rags, to help clear your name. Head through the gate, walk down the wooden platform, and talk to miner Uraccen who is sitting by the fire. Uraccen will say that you won't be able to speak with Madanach unless you can get past his bodyguard Borkul the Beast. Uraccen can entertain you with a story of one of Borkul's exploits before you go speak with him. Borkul is guarding one of the three gates in this room. When you ask him to see Madanach, he tells you that the toll for entry is a shiv. As alternatives to his request, you can brawl with him, intimidate or persuade him, or pickpocket the key from him.  Option  Dialogue  Reaction   I don't have a shiv. Then find one. That dung heap Grisvar's been known to make a few. Find a shiv   Here's your shiv. All right, head on in.

Nothing Bring the skooma to Grisvar, who will give you the shiv. If you want to keep the shiv, then you can still attempt the alternatives to completing Borkul's request. You can pickpocket an additional bottle of skooma from Duach and bribe Borkul with it. Alternately, you can also start a battle with the Forsworn prisoners (attack anyone but Grisvar). This locks you into killing Madanach, as he becomes hostile. This fight can be difficult; you have no armor, no enchantments, and your only non-conjured weapons are pickaxes and possibly shivs, though you can still use any magic or powers that you may possess. Once you've won, loot the key off Borkul's body and proceed to kill Madanach per the next section.  The King in Rags[edit] Planning to escape Once you get past the Orc, you will see Madanach sitting at a desk. He will direct some disparaging remarks at you regarding your predicament, and ask you what you want. Here, you can take one of two paths: take your revenge, or find your answers. If you seek revenge, you can kill Madanach here (or at any time) and then escape on your own. If you want a fair fight, you can tell him you plan to kill him; otherwise, just attack him. Attacking him will make all of the other prisoners hostile (except Grisvar), but as long as they are out of range, they will not rush in to join the fight. Search Madanach's body for a key and a note, then unlock the gate and exit the prison. If you seek answers instead, Madanach will direct you to Braig, another prisoner, to hear his story of injustice. After you have convinced Braig to tell his story, return to Madanach. You will see a different side of Madanach, and the horrors that drive his purpose. He tells you he wants to return to the war and will help you escape as well, but only if you prove your loyalty to him by killing Grisvar the Unlucky. If you gave your shiv to Borkul, you can get a new one from Madanach at this point. Find Grisvar and kill him. If you tell him that, ""Madanach says hello"", Grisvar will eventually become hostile and the other inmates will attack him. Once he's dead, return to Madanach, who will declare you an honorary member of the Forsworn and lead the prisoners to the escape tunnel. Escape[edit] Fighting for freedom After a short speech, follow Madanach and the Forsworn through the tunnel to Markarth Ruins. You will encounter a pair of frostbite spiders, then one or two Dwarven Spheres as you make your way through the ruins. If you're on your own, you can sneak off the bridge onto the floor below, as fighting alone will be quite difficult without any of your normal equipment. Once past the automatons, continue through the ruins until you reach a short tunnel that leads to a door to Markarth. Thonar will return your equipment and give you the Silver-Blood Family Ring if you are on your own and have killed Madanach when you exit the gates. If you sided with Madanach, a Forsworn woman named Kaie will be there to return your confiscated goods and give you the Armor, Boots, Gauntlets, and Helmet of the Old Gods. The Forsworn will all equip their own gear and run out. When you follow them through the door, you will emerge into a standoff between the Forsworn and Thonar Silver-Blood, accompanied by a Markarth City guard. After a short conversation, Madanach and the Forsworn will attack and kill Thonar, then fight their way through the rest of the city guard to the gates. Note that some of the townsfolk may be hostile to the Forsworn and can be killed during the breakout. Once outside the city walls, Madanach and any remaining Forsworn will then run to Druadach Redoubt where they will take up permanent residence. Madanach's Forsworn at Druadach Redoubt will remain friendly to you if you sided with him, although all other encampments will still be hostile. No matter which approach you used, you will be pardoned."

Subsequent actions after you acquire one of these gems depends on your membership status with the Thieves Guild. Not a Member of the Thieves Guild[edit] If you are not a member of the Thieves Guild, picking up the first Unusual Gem you encounter will activate the miscellaneous quest objective: ""Bring the Unusual Gem to an appraiser"". Depending on your past travels and interactions, following your objective marker will likely take you to Maul, a Nord thief in Riften. If you have not yet spoken with Maul, he will seek you out with some unsolicited advice. After the conversation, ask him what he knows about the gem. He will tell you that you need to show it to Vex of the Thieves Guild, to find out what the gem is worth. Maul will also tell you that to get to Vex, you must first become a member of the Thieves Guild. If you press for information on the guild, you will be told to find Brynjolf in Riften's marketplace. You can find him as suggested, or in the Bee and Barb at night. Talking to him will activate the quest A Chance Arrangement, which is the first step towards becoming a member of the Guild. Once you have access to The Ragged Flagon, seek out Vex for her appraisal of the gem. She will tell you that it is one of twenty-four stones that were pried from the crown of Queen Barenziah by a thief in an attempt to cover his tracks, and that only the complete set of twenty-four stones would be worth anything. If Maul does not tell you to find Brynjolf, you can seek him out yourself. Already a Member of the Thieves Guild[edit] If you are a full member of the Thieves Guild when you pick up the first stone, the quest is immediately activated with the objective: ""Bring the Unusual Gem to Vex in the Thieves Guild"". Find Vex in The Ragged Flagon. She will tell you that it is one of twenty-four stones that were pried from the crown of Queen Barenziah by a thief in an attempt to cover his tracks. She will further inform you that the stone is worthless on its own, but that if you can find the other twenty-three, the collection would be worth a substantial sum. Finding the Gems[edit] After showing the Unusual Gem to Vex, the gems are renamed ""Stones of Barenziah,"" and will appear as such in your inventory when in your possession. You must now find all twenty-four stones. You'll need to complete some other tasks before you have access to all locations where the gems are to be found: Begin the Dark Brotherhood questline or start the Destroy the Dark Brotherhood! quest. Purchase Proudspire Manor in Solitude. (25,000 gold) Join the College of Winterhold by completing First Lessons. You must also start Under Saarthal and progress at least to the point where Tolfdir tells you to speak with the Arch-Mage; until this point, the Arch-Mage's Quarters are locked behind an inaccessible door. Aside from those, most other gems can actually be obtained at any point in the game. Many are located in places that you will be sent to during other quests, so you may want to consider getting the stone concurrently with the quest.

Travel to Solstheim and locate Hugin Ice-Shaper west of Raven Rock. Read Hugin Ice-Shaper's Notebook and craft an item of Nordic jewelry to complete the quest.","Make a Purchase[edit] Nordic circlet Hugin Ice-Shaper This quest will be added to your journal the first time you obtain a Nordic Amulet, Nordic Circlet, or Nordic Ring. A Certificate of Authenticity will be automatically added to your inventory, and you will be directed to read it to progress the quest. Nordic jewelry can be found in the world as random loot. Alternatively, all general goods and jewelry merchants will have these items available for sale, so the quickest method may be to purchase a piece from them. For example, in Riften you can purchase Nordic jewelry from the Pawned Prawn or from Madesi's stall in Riften Grand Plaza. Note that these items are all relatively pricey given that they're pieces of jewelry. Once you've obtained your first piece of Nordic jewelry, read the certificate to learn that the creator of the jewelry is a craftsman named Hugin Ice-Shaper who can be found on Solstheim. Stalhrim Lapidary[edit] Travel to Solstheim and you will be directed to a spot west of Raven Rock, in the ash wastes just north of the Earth Stone. There you will find two hostile reavers (a melee fighter and an archer) standing over the body of Hugin. Dispense with them both and loot the melee reaver for three powerful enchanted items: a leveled Nordic Amulet of Health, a leveled Nordic Circlet of Magicka, and a leveled Nordic Ring of Stamina. You can then locate and read Hugin Ice-Shaper's Notebook to learn how to craft Nordic jewelry. To complete the quest, you will need to craft a piece of Nordic jewelry yourself. Be sure to grab the required components from the satchel next to the body: three samples of stalhrim and three quicksilver ingots. Head back into town and find a forge in order to craft the jewelry of your choice and finish the quest."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Old_Friends","Talk to Neloth in Tel Mithryn. Investigate the graveyard near Tel Mithryn using the Ring of Tracking. Return to Neloth. Go to Highpoint Tower and kill Ildari Sarothril. Return to Neloth for your reward.","The Ring of Tracking[edit] Something is wrong at the graveyard. With his steward killed, his tower withered, and several other annoyances related to Ash Spawn, master Telvanni wizard Neloth finally loses his patience when three Ash Spawn attack his tower. Once you have killed the Ash Spawn, enter the tower and talk to the wizard who will reveal it is finally time to investigate who is behind the attacks: ""Yes. I have enemies. Legions of them back in Morrowind. However, in this case I have reason to believe it is someone in Solstheim."" When asked if he wants the responsible persons dead, he will respond: ""Not yet. That may come later. First I need to identify the culprit. I've enchanted this ring to find the source of the attacks. Here, take it."" He will then hand you the Ring of Tracking and explain that you need to wear it in order for it to work. The ring was enchanted with a bit of ash from the last Ash Spawn attack and will allow you to follow the magical link back to the source of the summoned Ash Spawn. However, it has its disadvantages: ""The link is weak, so you'll have to be within about a hundred feet of the source."" Neloth will then order you to walk around the grounds while wearing the ring. Equip the ring and leave the tower behind. From Beyond the Grave[edit] Once outside, head north to the field of mushrooms and then east towards a lone evergreen tree at the shore, until you reach a small graveyard inhabited by a peaceful netch family. With the ring equipped, one of the coffins will have a clear bluish glow. As you approach the graveyard, the expected Ash Spawn will appear and attack, so fight it and investigate Ildari's sarcophagus. The coffin lacks a dead body, and contains a staff of calm and a heart stone. Grab the stone and return to Neloth in the tower. ""She lives. Seek her in Highpoint Tower."" If you have already played through March of the Dead, the name Ildari should be familiar, due to the journal you found when you helped Captain Veleth with his Ash Spawn problems in Fort Frostmoth. When you hand the stone to Neloth, he will be quite surprised and reveal Ildari Sarothril to be a former apprentice of his: ""Ildari? Then it's my own fault. She was my apprentice before Talvas. She volunteered for one of my experiments involving heart stones. It was quite annoying when she died."" He will then elaborate on how she died: ""My necropsies of Spriggans led me to believe that a heart stone could be implanted in a person's chest, granting them great power. I was considering replacing my heart with a heart stone. Fortunately Ildari offered to let me operate on her first. Of course this was before your briarheart expedition. Now I know that I did the surgery all wrong."" When you tell him that the sarcophagus was empty, he will be quick to put two and two together: ""That's impossible. Wait... unless she didn't actually die! The heart stone could have kept her right at the edge of life and death. Could it be? Could Ildari still be alive? Could she be my nemesis? Wait a moment while I cast a more specific divination."" Moments afterward, Neloth will cast a spell that will light up most of the tower, and will start to talk in a completely different voice, as if a spirit is talking through him: ""She lives. Seek her in Highpoint Tower."" Neloth will then return to normal and immediately order you to head to said tower, as he can't be bothered himself. The last thing he will say is: ""Go rip that thrice cursed heart stone from her chest."" Highpoint Tower[edit] Highpoint Tower Highpoint Tower is located north of Ildari's former hideout, Fort Frostmoth, southeast from Brodir Grove. Enter the tower via a tunnel on the north side; fight the guarding Ash Spawn and head up the stairs. Once inside, head down the spiral staircase. Two stories down, you will come across a table with Ildari's Journal, vol. I, where a weakened Ildari Sarothril describes how she was saved by some miners, and how she is planning her revenge on her former master back in Tel Mithryn. Continue down the stairs and head west until you reach a chamber, filled with egg sacks from various spiders. As you enter the chamber, beware of the spellcaster trap to the north, as it can complicate your battle against the spiders considerably. Multiple paths are available here; the tunnel to the south leads to a huge spiders nest and some useful veins, while the tunnel with the spellcaster trap is the way towards your goal. At the first intersection, enter the room with the three Ash Spawn and pick the fight, then proceed to the north and remove the soul gem from yet another spellcaster trap. In the next chamber, a tripwire triggers some falling boulders. Use the arcane enchanter if needed, and beware the elemental rune in the center of the room. Head down the eastern path until you reach the rare sight of an elemental rune on the wall, with tunnels leading north and south. Head south until you reach a jail-like area with several cells. The table in the center of the jail has Ildari's Journal, vol. II, detailing how Ildari was able to survive Neloth's operation, and how her paranoia against the very people who saved her slowly increases due to the heart stone implemented in her chest. She also describes how she will keep a few of them as prisoners for future experiments. Before long, Niyya will call to you from her cell. When you pick the lock, she will come out and thank you: ""Thank you for rescuing me. That witch was going to kill me soon, I just know it."" She will then tell you the background: ""We were digging in these mines when she found us. She was hurt so bad. We took pity on her and nursed her back to health. She repaid our kindness by attacking us in the middle of the night. Those of us that didn't die were made prisoners."" She will go on to explain how Ildari used her saviors for experiments and will angrily encourage you to make her suffer a painful death. She will then rush towards the exit, with plans to leave Solstheim for good.  Kill the Witch[edit] An Ash Guardian is born Return to the elemental rune, head north and locate the passage to the east. A wooden ramp leads down while a wooden catwalk goes forward with a crate holding meat on top. Follow the catwalk to find two orichalcum veins to mine. Return to the ramp to proceed to the next chamber. In the next chamber is a glowing sapphire geode on the ground, while another can be reached by traversing up the wooden structure. There is another orichalcum ore veins on the other side of the room from the first geode and a gold ore vein near the wooden structure's ramp. Proceed forward in a northwestern direction until you reach a large chamber with a strange device in the middle. Before long, Ildari will speak from her spot above: ""You've gone far enough. Neloth is a fool to think he could send some low life to finish me off."" With these words, she will activate the device, creating an Ash Guardian. At this point, numerous Ash Spawn will emerge as well, so pick the tough battle and dispose of the Ash Guardian. With the area cleared, start traversing the woodworks to the southwest and explore the path thoroughly for some treasure and ingredients. Once you reach a ledge with a table and a copy of Nchunak's Fire and Faith(?), loot the shelves for various potions and other loot and read through  Ildari's Journal, vol. III. In this final volume, Ildari describes how she patiently started getting her vengeance on Neloth, and how she is responsible for the death of Varona Nelas, and the withering of Tel Mithryn tower. Proceed to climb the woodworks and follow the tunnel leading southwest, killing all the Ash Spawn that emerge on the way. Ildari Sarothril Once you reach a broken-down wall, two paths are available. The path to the northeast leads to a dead end and an open chest with some minor loot while the adjacent path leads to a wooden bridge. Cross the bridge and follow the tunnel as it twists and turns until you reach the final chamber, the lair of Ildari Sarothril. Ildari will be on the woodworks above and will have two elemental traps shooting at you at all times. Dodge the magical attacks and locate the entrance to the southwest and follow the path as it leads you to the second floor. Ildari will now start attacking you. She is a powerful sorceress with several spells at her disposal, although she will mainly use her staff of lightning bolts to attack you. After the battle, Ildari will kneel down. With Ildari helpless, follow Neloth's orders and rip out the heart stone from her chest, forever ending her vengeful scheme. Once everything is quiet, claim a reward from the boss-leveled chest and search the shelves for jewelry, ingredients, and other loot. Activate the lever and watch the spikes disappear from the entrance to the southeast. Head up the stairs, to the very top of the tower, and pull the chain for a very quick escape route back to Solstheim. Reward[edit] Back in Tel Mithryn, Neloth will be happy to see the end of his nemesis and will, for once, reward you accordingly: ""Well, well. You have proven to be a more valuable ally than I anticipated. I have a staff for you, but I would also like to make you a member of my household. A member of House Telvanni. No need to thank me. I know you are overwhelmed with gratitude."" He will then hand you a random, leveled staff and tell you that your new membership of the household means very little for the time being, although he will promise you a bed and a chest in his tower (see bugs)."

Inhale the incense fumes and speak to Peryite's apparition. Kill Orchendor in the Dwemer ruin Bthardamz. Return to the shrine for your reward.","Escaped Afflicted[edit] You may encounter an Afflicted Refugee during your travels, once you have reached level 10, who asks you to stop ""ogling the grotesque"". He will say, when asked about his unhealthy appearance, that he suffers from the plague and would have died years ago without Peryite's protection. He will point you to Kesh at the Shrine to Peryite for more information before continuing on his way to High Rock, adding an objective to your journal. The shrine is located in The Reach, far to the northeast of Markarth, a short walk northwest of Karthwasten, a little southwest of the Dragontooth Crater landmark. A Lonely Worshipper[edit] Kesh the Clean preparing the incense You will arrive at the shrine after being directed by the Afflicted Refugee, or simply find the way on your own after level 12, and you will notice that the shrine is relatively humble, containing little more than a table holding the Speech skill book The Buying Game, a cooking pot, an Alchemy Lab, and an odd-looking golden cauldron. The only remaining worshipper of Peryite is a Khajiit named Kesh the Clean who wanders about the shrine. When you approach Kesh, he will be quite surprised to see another person at the remote shrine. When you ask for an audience with Peryite, Kesh will advise you that, to gain one, some incense is needed and creating this incense involves mixing four items in the cauldron, each of which you will need to supply. Crafting the Incense[edit] Specifically, Kesh needs one of each of the following: Vampire Dust, a Silver Ingot, a Flawless Ruby, and a Deathbell flower. He will recommend shops for the dust, mines for the silver and ruby, and the frozen tundra for the flower, though he will warn you that obtaining vampire dust from Vampires can be very dangerous. Note that if you already have some or all of these items in your inventory, you will have to drop them after Kesh tells you to collect them, and then pick them back up. Otherwise, the quest objective will not tell you to deliver the ingredients to him. Alternatively, you can put them in a nearby unused cooking pot and collect them after. Flawless Ruby: This is probably the hardest of the items to obtain, as the standard way of doing so depends on randomly finding one while mining. Just southwest of the Shrine and directly east of Ragnvald (on the other side of the mountain) there is a small Dwemer ruin haunted by a whisp-mother. There is an unlocked chest embedded behind a concrete slab along the outer region of the mesa, amidst a dense layer of fog, which may contain a flawless ruby. You can dependably pick one up from inside Shriekwind Bastion: Halfway through the dungeon, locate a blood-spattered room containing a single throne. Examine the floor near the unlit fire pit on the right for the ruby. The dungeon is inhabited by Vampires, so you can also obtain the Vampire Dust while there. Alternatively, you can find a Flawless Ruby on a remote boat wreck north of Reachwater Rock at a bend in the river there (map). The wreckage contains various gems (the ruby can be hidden under one of the seats, so look around at all angles to make sure that you find it). Vampire Dust: If you intend to get the ruby from Shriekwind Bastion, slay one of its vampires for its dust while there. Otherwise, any vampire dungeon will do. Silver Ingot: To obtain this, follow Kesh's advice. Head east down the mountain from the shrine and locate the mining town of Karthwasten. Just outside the entrance to Fenn's Gulch Mine is a smelter with several silver ingots scattered around. Deathbell Flower: Deathbell can be found all over Skyrim, either as plants or as cuttings. The biggest concentration can be found in the Forelhost Refectory. The flowers appear in abundance in and around Solitude. They can be picked, or cuttings stolen, from the main trading room of Angeline's Aromatics and the teachers' rooms in the Bards College. Many of these flowers can also be harvested in the depths of Forsaken Crypt, and the swampy marshes north of Morthal teem with them. A quick way to get a deathbell is to travel to the Abandoned Shack, where there is a sample just outside the front door. Once you have collected one of each item, a quest update will direct you to return to Kesh at the shrine. When you hand him the ingredients, he will head to the cauldron and prepare a mixture yielding fumes. He will then ask you to inhale deeply to summon Peryite. If you talk to Kesh before he finishes mixing, the next quest objective may fail to activate. Inhale Deeply[edit] A surreal vision of Peryite's shrine As soon as you inhale the fumes, a quick flash will give way to a surreal experience, with the world around you painted in misty deeply-saturated colors, and a few ghostly skeevers will appear. Peryite will then speak thusly, ""Breathe deep, mortal. I would have you hear me well, so let these vapors fill your lungs."" Asking Peryite if you were poisoned will elicit, ""In a sense, but no more poisoned than a fool after too much wine."" When asked what he wants he will explain, ""I have watched you for some time, you know. The decisions you've made intrigue me, and I wonder if you are a proper agent for a task of mine. I sent a blessing to Mundus, a wasting plague that infected a scattering of Breton villages. One of my monks, the elf Orchendor, was sent to gather these Afflicted. He shepherded them into Bthardamz for me, but has since lost his way. I will not stand for betrayal. I want you to go to Bthardamz and Kill Orchendor, in my name."" He will then disappear and the cauldron will be deactivated. Back in the real world, both Kesh and your map marker will point you to the Dwemer ruin of Bthardamz, easily reached by foot from the shrine. The ruin is expansive; you may wish to stock up on supplies before the lengthy trek through it. Bthardamz[edit] The ruins of Bthardamz The exterior area of Bthardamz is as huge as the ruin itself. Watch out for patrolling Afflicted and their poisonous vomit attacks. Locate the entrance, pull the handle to release the iron bars and head inside the introductory room for a bit of treasure. Finally, take a deep breath and enter the ruin itself, Bthardamz Upper District. An Afflicted praying to Peryite An Afflicted vomiting poison Upon entering, notice the many cauldrons with green fumes similar to the one back at the shrine. While these pose no threat, the Afflicted inhabiting the entire ruin will attack you on sight. Though their illness renders them weak individually, they are dangerous in groups. At the first intersection, either pick the lock on the gate to the north, or take the long way through a sleeping area and fight the opposition. A locked cage in the northeastern room contains a chest. Further north there are three Afflicted praying in a large room. If you approach in sneak mode, you can overhear them and learn about the mixture of despair and fanaticism among the Afflicted: Afflicted (female): ""Peryite, heed our call if you deem us worthy. Our leader, Orchendor, has led us here and for that we are thankful. He has shown us that our suffering is not a punishment, but a blessing."" Afflicted (male): ""Yes, a blessing. For many months we have sought your guidance, yet we have heard nothing from you. If we do not please you, give us a sign so that we may understand why."" Afflicted (female): ""Yes, a sign. We are lost without your guidance. On the ninth of Rain's Hand our prayers went unanswered, yet here we stand, not faltering in our belief that soon you will show yourself to us."" Afflicted (male): ""Yes, show yourself to us. Until that day, we will continue to devote our lives to you and suffer for you."" Afflicted (female): ""Yes, suffer for you."" Keep heading west until you reach a large chamber with four Afflicted. Release them from their pain and pull the handle on the northern ledge. This will lower the bars blocking your progress to the south and provide access to a cave-like structure with a treasure chest hidden underneath the entrance. At the next intersection, consider examining the room to the east, but beware of a surprise attack from two Dwarven Spheres. Take the southern path, avoiding the pressure plate that activates two swinging blade traps. The last room contains three Afflicted enemies and the entrance to the next zone, Bthardamz Workshop.  Workshop[edit] The workshop contains three entrances back to the first zone, Bthardamz Upper District. You will arrive from the eastern entrance to living quarters with two Afflicted, a mage and a melee fighter. You may witness a scene in which the melee fighter wakes up the mage, bringing orders from Orchendor: Two Afflicted discussing a delivery Afflicted (melee): ""I'm sorry to wake you, my Brother. I have a request from Orchendor."" Afflicted (mage): ""Yes, what is it?"" Afflicted (melee): ""He requests more barrels of ichor to be delivered to the Arcanex tomorrow."" Afflicted (mage): ""This is the reason you wake me? I already have Orchendor's request taken care of."" Afflicted (melee): ""I'm sorry my Brother."" Afflicted (mage): ""Now leave me to my sleep. My strength and patience are waning."" Afflicted (melee): ""Yes, my Brother. Forgive me. May the blessing of Peryite be with you."" Afflicted (mage): ""Yes, yes, as with you. Now be off.""  Further on you will have no choice but to go for one of the two southern entrances. Both of these are accessible from the huge southwestern chamber, which is guarded by three Dwarven Spider Workers. The door at the top of the stairs leads to a previously inaccessible area of the Upper District (you will be able to see the door you previously used from above), while the southernmost door (where the map marker leads you) takes you to the ground floor area of the previously inaccessible Upper District. Take a bit of time and explore the area and the rooftops, although only a limited amount of treasure can be found. An Afflicted talking to her sleeping brother Optionally, you can locate the entrance to Bthardamz Dwelling. If you enter in sneak mode and wait a moment, you may hear the voice of a woman speaking softly. The Afflicted's monologue at her sleeping brother's bed will give you even more insight into the situation of Orchendor's followers: ""Are you asleep? I know you can't hear me, brother. I don't like what we've become. We've been here so long and what do we have to show for it? Orchendor promised a place where we would be accepted and taken care of. He promised Peryite would be present at all times and give us comfort in our suffering. Forgive me for saying this, brother, but I have not felt Peryite's presence. I want out. I want to leave this place. I long for the fresh air of the Reach. This place only makes us sicker. But who am I kidding, I know you wouldn't let me leave, brother. You truly believe in Orchendor and his promises. I know this place will eventually kill us. I have come to accept that. But I will always regret that day I introduced you to Orchendor."" Unlock the gate to access a chest and the Speech skill book Biography of the Wolf Queen before continuing on to the Upper District. Locate the set of stairs just northeast of the Dwelling entrance and proceed upwards, all the way to the ceiling, then enter Bthardamz Lower District.  Lower District[edit] Afflicted in the Lower District of Bthardamz A Dwemer blade trap Proceed forward to the first room and examine the cage for some minor loot. Fight two Dwarven Spiders in the corridor and enter a huge arena-like chamber with three Afflicted guards. Pull the lever and use the trap in the center of the room to your advantage, then take out any remaining enemies. Proceed east through another tunnel until you arrive in a multi-level chamber featuring numerous platforms and a small underground lake. Start by exploring the ground floor area, killing enemies sequentially if possible, otherwise they can easily group up on you. Once you have crossed the river, move through the gate and then through a stone archway. The archway has a pressure plate witch activates a swinging bar trap above. There is also a lever on the right which will reset the trap. The stairs to the north lead to a circular pathway surrounding a waterfall. As you travel up the stairs, jump right onto the ledge north of the opening into the main chamber. Take an immediate right and down a narrow path to find a skeleton and an unlocked chest. Go back to the upper pathway then head back down stairs and travel east. There is a gold ore vein on the ground next to the wall beside the base of the staircase. Follow the path to the right, watching out for three patrolling Afflicted, and head up the stairs. On this platform you will find a Dwarven Spider and a Dwarven Spider Worker. Cross the winding path to the south to find the entrance to the Bthardamz Study. Upon entering the Study, open the gate to your left to enter an office-like room containing a chest with minor loot. Open the double doors to the south to find a set of stairs with a spinning blade trap. There is a large button at the base which activates it. As you progress to the upper level you will encounter a Dwarven Sphere. Take a moment before climbing the next staircase to loot the chest to the left of the altar on a dais beside some barrels of ichor. Turn west and continue up the second set of stairs to find the passage leading to the second level of the Bthardamz Lower District. A passage with tables on both sides opens up to a view of the entire Bthardamz Lower District. Observe the waterfall passing through the circular platform above where the chest was found, as four afflicted will pass through the sequence of archways which opens up directly behind the waterfall. Either snipe them as they pass by the falls or face them head on. Head down the short ramp to the north and turn right to find a gate to a room containing a chest with minor loot. To the right are two curved ramps leading to a landing containing three Afflicted and a chest on the wall near the tables, but which is otherwise a dead end. Head south and follow the path to the doors to Bthardamz Arcanex, where you will finally face Orchendor.  Showdown[edit] A Dwarven Centurion emitting a blast of steam Orchendor attacking the player The Arcanex zone resembles the previous zone with its multiple levels, and is crawling with enemies, including Dwarven Spiders and Spheres. The water holds nothing of interest, so fight your way through the chamber and take the steep slope upstairs. Before entering the building-like structure below the ceiling, take a quick detour to the left for a bit of treasure, then face a Dwarven Centurion and a few Spiders—the last guardians before the final showdown against the treacherous Wood Elf. Orchendor is a powerful Spellsword who knows several protective spells and magical barriers that increase his magic defenses to as high as 80%, making him a hard opponent for mages. He also knows Invisibility, Teleportation, and Ice Storm spells, and as an Afflicted he can use the toxic vomit attack as well. Loot his body once it is over for the elevator key, a boss-leveled amount of gold, the Alteration skill book Reality & Other Falsehoods and several other valuable items. Head to the upper level and locate the locked door, then enter for a chest and an elevator ride towards some much-needed fresh air. It's time to head back to Peryite for your reward.  Spellbreaker[edit] Back at the shrine, Kesh continues to wander around aimlessly. Asking his permission to take another breath of the fumes will gain you entrance once again into the surreal world of Peryite, who will say, ""Well done, mortal. All things are in their order, and Orchendor roams the Pits. His betrayal will be punished, and your obedience is rewarded."" When you bid him farewell, he will hand you the Spellbreaker, a unique shield capable of protecting from both magic and sword. The cauldron will then be empty and you can do nothing but leave Kesh the Clean to his lonely existence at the Shrine to Peryite."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Over_the_Edge","Look for a note at the Four Shields Tavern. Search downriver for the body. Read the guard's note. Confront Aldepius. Meet Peladius on the Dragon Bridge. Defeat Peladius. Retrieve the armor.","A Suicide in Haafingar[edit] Upon installing the Alternative Armors - Steel Soldier Creation, you will be directed to read a note located in the Four Shields Tavern in Dragon Bridge. Reading it, you will learn of an apparent suicide which took place at the town's eponymous Dragon Bridge. A new recruit guardsman had gone missing but a fellow guard named Aldepius claims to have seen him leap from the bridge. You will find the guard's body quite a ways downstream to the northeast of the bridge (though on the south bank of the river). It is just before the river meets another on their way to the bay at Solitude; about half-way between Dragon Bridge and the Solitude Sawmill. On the guard's body, you will find a note that shows the dead guard suspected Aldepius of being a bandit informant rather than a stationed member of the Dragon Bridge garrison. You will need to return to town to confront Aldepius. Duel at the Dragon Bridge[edit] Face Peladius on the bridge Upon re-entering the Four Shields Tavern, you will find that Aldepius is nowhere to be found. Instead, he has left a confession at one of the tables, inviting you to face him in honorable combat at the Dragon Bridge. In it he admits that his real name is Peladius and that he is a former member of the Crimson Dirks bandit gang. Peladius will be waiting for you on the bridge and will attack on sight, so be prepared to fight to the death.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Paarthurnax_(quest)","(Optional) Talk to Esbern or Delphine. Kill Paarthurnax. Return to Esbern or Delphine. Tell them Paarthurnax is dead.","Initiating the Quest[edit] This quest may initiate in two ways: At your discretion: After you complete Alduin's Bane and defeat the World-Eater in combat, you may consult with Esbern to learn of Alduin's whereabouts. This begins the quest. Automatically: If you have not yet spoken with Esbern or Delphine at Sky Haven Temple, when the Season Unending conference is held, Delphine will approach you and start the quest automatically. Delphine does require you to give a reply. She issues a demand and says you two have nothing to talk about until you have carried out the deed, even though talking to her is still possible. The Stakeholders[edit] Delphine and Esbern have discovered that Paarthurnax is the Master of the Greybeards and an ancient enemy of the Blades. You can argue in Paarthurnax's defense, but both will reiterate the war crimes and atrocities committed by Paarthurnax. In addition, Delphine thinks that his betrayal of Alduin actually makes him worse, because it could mean that he might betray the Dragonborn in turn. They will tell you that their oaths as Blades prevents them from giving you any further help until you kill Paarthurnax. If you go to Arngeir and tell him that the Blades want Paarthurnax dead, he will tell you that Paarthurnax supported Alduin because all dragons were in league with Alduin at first, and that Paarthurnax could not help it. He will go on to say that Paarthurnax did eventually rebel against Alduin, and was instrumental in Alduin's first demise. You are given the option to tell him that Paarthurnax must die or that you are going to spare the dragon. This will affect the conversation between Delphine and Arngeir if you are forced to negotiate a treaty in Season Unending. Alternatively, you can go to Paarthurnax at the Throat of the World. He acknowledges that all dragons thirst for dominance and that the Dragonborn shares this thirst, though he believes that he has overcome this predisposition through the sheer power of will and that he can be trusted. The Choice[edit] You do not need to give an explicit reply. If you choose not to carry out Delphine's order to kill Paarthurnax, the game withdraws this quest. It disappears from your quest log without any notice. Paarthurnax is an easy foe for those who are leveled sufficiently, comparable to the average Frost dragon. You will receive a dragon soul and the usual set of dragon bones and dragon scales upon defeating him.  Killing Paarthurnax will enrage Arngeir; if you return to High Hrothgar, he will angrily lecture you on your decision and even go so far as to threaten violence if you do not leave. After this, the other Greybeards will also fail to acknowledge you. On the other hand, the Blades will talk to you again. If Paarthurnax dies: Arngeir retracts the Greybeards' hospitality, and it is no longer possible to ask him for the locations of word walls. Paarthurnax will no longer be around to provide meditation bonuses to certain shouts. If you already have a bonus, it will not go away; you will just be unable to change it. Taking anything from High Hrothgar will count as stealing. The Blades will welcome you once again and support you on Dragon Hunting missions. If Paarthurnax lives: Arngeir will still disclose the location of word walls. Paarthurnax will still provide meditation bonuses for shout words. Paarthurnax will appear for an extra cutscene after Alduin's defeat, wherein he details his plans to rein in the dragons and teach them to live peacefully, following the Way of the Voice. This does not make gameplay any different — some will attack, and some won't, unless you attack them. After this, the quest will disappear from the journal. Taking anything from Sky Haven Temple will count as stealing. Removing items from some containers in the Sleeping Giant Inn will count as stealing, and you will lose access to the free bed there. If you have not brought three people to the Blades already, Delphine's recruitment quest will remain uncompleted, or will become unavailable if you have not started it. However, it is entirely possible to recruit three followers for Delphine before being given the quest to kill Paarthurnax. If you have not already obtained the potion from Esbern's Dragon Research, you will be unable to do so. In order to get the potion, you must do so between the quest Alduin's Wall and reading the Elder Scroll step of Alduin's Bane. The only real consequence of not killing him is no longer having dialogue with both Delphine and Esbern, and thus no longer having the option to go on Dragon Hunts with your recruited Blades. They still, however, act like regular companions - but of course, can only accompany you one at a time, like any other companion, rather than all three at once on a specific dragon-hunt."

(Optional) Reveal the truth to an old friend.","A Shadowmark in Raven Rock[edit] ""So tell me... how's my brother Delvin?"" For members of the Thieves Guild back in Skyrim, the local blacksmith of Raven Rock has a very familiar surname: Mallory. Glover Mallory has a house next to his smithy and to the left of the front door is a shadowmark. Approach Glover when he is working the forge between 8am and 8pm and ask about the shadowmark. He will confess his relation to Delvin Mallory back in The Ragged Flagon, saying things like: ""So tell me... how's my brother Delvin? Still spending his nights at the Ragged Flagon trying to win Vex's heart?"" He will however also say: ""Damn layabout never even bothers to send his own flesh and blood a letter saying how he's doing. Can you imagine?"" In the end, he will have a Thieves Guild-related job for you: ""Eager to make some coin, eh? That's the spirit. I'll tell you what. The Guild's got a problem out here that I've been trying to deal with for years, but haven't been able to handle. A fellow Breton who went by the name Esmond Tyne showed up on my doorstep about a fortnight ago. He noticed the shadowmarks like you did, and I thought he was one of us."" He will then proceed to tell you what Esmond Tyne stole: ""It's my own formula for improved bonemold. Took me years to perfect."" As for the whereabouts of Esmond, Glover only knows a bit: ""Well, before he ran off, he was talking some nonsense about trying to fence goods to the rieklings at Castle Karstaag. I told him he was crazy to even think about talking to those vicious little buggers, but he wouldn't listen. I'd bet a fat purse of coin that he's either dead or hiding out up there."" When you tell him you will retrieve the bonemold formula, he'll ""make sure you're set up right"". Castle Karstaag Caverns[edit] The remains of Esmond Tyne Castle Karstaag is a massive fortress of ice, located in the northwestern region of Solstheim. Your objective is the  Castle Karstaag Caverns, located at the bottom of the waterfall west of Saering's Watch. Enter the Caverns and head upstream. Rieklings inhabit the cave and Esmond Tyne didn't make it very far in his attempt to fence goods to them. In the first huge chamber, he can be found dead with his lit lantern next to him. You can easily reach him by swimming silently, so you will never have to deal with the rieklings. Loot his corpse for the bonemold formula and various leveled loot and leave the Caverns the same way you came. The Reward[edit] When you return to Glover with the formula in hand, he will not grieve over Esmond's death: ""I told him not to head up there. Sounds like the bloody fool got what he deserved."" He will then hand you the reward, the key to his house and basement, saying you can help yourself to whatever you find there. In fact, you can claim everything inside the house, so look around before heading down into the basement. Unlock the door and behold all the treasure, proving that Glover has been a high-esteemed Thieves Guild member and that he is very rich: The hidden room Thief Cache Strong Box Glover's Letter Enchanted, leveled shield Enchanted leveled sword 3 soul gems 5 different poisons   3 different potions 4 coin purses A complete set of Blackguard's Armor 3 bottles of Black-Briar Reserve 6 bottles of Black-Briar Mead Lockpicks  One Last Thing[edit] ""I... I can't believe it."" Pick up Glover's Letter from the basement room and read through it. It solves the mystery about Sapphire from Riften and reveals that Glover is her real father. It tells the tale about how he ran away from the farm where she was born, only to return fifteen years later when she had been abducted by bandits. It also reveals why Glover chose to move to Solstheim, simply because he saw her in the Thieves Guild and couldn't bear to tell her the truth. Time to tell Sapphire the truth, so travel to Riften and seek out Sapphire. Hand her the letter and she will say: ""I... I can't believe it. All those years on the farm, and my mother never told me about any of this. Words can't even begin to describe how much I appreciate you bringing this to me. Here, take this. I used to carry it for good luck, but I think you deserve it more than I do."" She will then hand you an exquisite sapphire, a unique item worth 5000 gold."

You'll find that he is somewhat bitter about living and working in Solstheim, should you speak with him. One thing that does seem to spark his interest is the East Empire pendants. The pendants were once used as employee incentives, but are no longer being produced and, as a result, are now considered a valuable collector's item. Fethis lets you know that, if you find any of these East Empire pendants in your travels throughout Solstheim, he will be glad to buy them from you for 500 gold per pendant. The pendants are located in East Empire Company strongboxes, which are locked with an expert lock and contain other valuable loot as well.

Most of the strongboxes are at locations marked on your map, but for those which are in unmarked locations, the entry for the ""Location"" column is the location from which it is easiest to find the strongbox.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Pale_Lady","Find Frostmere Crypt. Learn about theft. Fight deeper into the crypt. Banish The Pale Lady one way or another.","While traveling near Frostmere Crypt, you may come upon several bandits attacking one of their own. Whether to help or not is up to you. Regardless of your choice, you will learn that some sort of thievery has occurred inside the crypt and the quest will begin, requiring you to investigate further. Alternately, you may start the quest without witnessing the bandit attack if Eisa Blackthorn is present outside the Crypt. She has her journal in her inventory which once read, also starts the Pale Lady quest, but this is not necessary if you save her during the attack. Fighting through the crypt, you can find two journals, one belonging to a leader of the bandits, Kyr, and one to a woman met earlier, Eisa. Reading both journals will update optional quest steps and reveal that the bandits found a hidden underground forest while digging for treasures. It is also revealed that Eisa's friend, Ra'jirr, seems to have started losing his mind soon after the forest was discovered. The opening area of Frostmere Crypt has two bandits talking at a table, and a third bandit off to the right in a side chamber. Opening the iron gate leads further down into the crypt. An iron door barred from the other side will force you into a large cavern on an upper walkway with bandits below. One bandit near a door lever from a west side position can be killed from a distance. Moving forward will bring you to a T-intersection - to the left is a guarded room with a grindstone, supplies and a bored bandit guard outside. The path to the right opens up into a large area leading immediately to three rooms. To the left is Kyr's room where there is one of the two journals, a chest and some basic loot. Straight ahead is another sleeping room with Ra'jirr's Note and Eisa's Journal. To the right is a lower level area and two more bandits. Two exits lead from the room. One is a drawbridge in the raised position, controlled by the west side position bandit above, so the only option is to pass through the door. Two more bandits are in this room with low level loot. A further passage leads around to a rock face being excavated and a bandit controlling the bridge lever. Activating the lever opens up the lower level mining area, with two more bandits and an iron ore deposit. A passage to the west leads down to another chamber with two more bandits and more mining tunnels. A tunnel leads downward and to the south, but be careful of a dead-fall trap. Another T-intersection leads to two choices. To the east is a small chamber with an empty chest and an ore deposit close by. To the west, the mine tunnels change more to a crypt-like setting and another bandit working a silver ore deposit. A door in this chamber leads to Frostmere Depths. Eventually you will reach the underground forest only to find the dying bandit leader mumbling his last words and Ra'jirr attacking The Pale Lady, a named Wispmother. At this point you have three options: Quickly run up to Ra'jirr's body, loot the sword—appropriately named ""The Pale Blade""—and place it onto the pedestal nearby, thus finishing the quest and banishing the Pale Lady. Save Ra'jirr from The Pale Lady using either Whirlwind Sprint or Slow Time before she has the chance to attack him. Pickpocket The Pale Blade from him, then place it on the pedestal. Ra'jirr will remain standing in front of the pedestal and will attack on sight, despite your having saved his life. Fight the Pale Lady. You can do this after having done one of the above by simply removing the sword from the pedestal. If desired, it can be placed back on the pedestal, re-banishing the Pale Lady, to give you a break during combat. Once the Pale Lady is killed, the quest will be complete with The Pale Blade as your reward. After you have slain The Pale Lady, make sure that you follow the path west-southwest of the pedestal until you get to the end of a rock formation, turn right and climb up to find another path that leads to a master-locked chest. If you follow the stream located on the eastern side of the pedestal, closer to the word wall, you'll find an orichalcum vein. On your way out, next to the iron doors, is a boss-leveled chest, and near it is a sword. On top of the staircase leaving the forest is a trigger-plate that will release poisonous darts. The next room has a bridge leading over a pool of water back to the entrance of the ruins. On the bottom is an adept-locked chest with some gold and a leveled magicka and a healing potion. Two soul gems, a piece of armor, a random potion and a leveled Battleaxe is also there."

I should ring [sic] her neck!"" When asked to elaborate she will explain about a foolish student, Larina, who stole Pantea's flute and sold it to a necromancer, who believed in Larina's story about the flute being able to make the dead dance. Pantea is understandably upset as the flute has been passed down through seventeen generations, so she asks you to retrieve it for her – right away. Hob's Fall Cave[edit] A map marker will now point you towards Hob's Fall Cave, a necromancer den northeast of Frostflow Lighthouse in the Winterhold region. While the cave itself seems straightforward, it has quite a few secrets worth exploring, so enter and take a look around. The ledge overlooking the first room is where you will return after a successful trek, so locate the icy path to the left and make your way through the tunnels and fight the hostile necromancers guarding the desk with a soul gem and a treasure chest. Proceed forward until you reach a suspension bridge. Look over the edge and notice the necromancer camp deep down below, with an alchemy lab and several bedrolls. Use the ledges to jump down for a surprise attack, then loot the camp for a rare unusual gem and a copy of the Restoration skill book The Exodus. Finding the Flute[edit] Head back up, using the path to get back on track, and then fight the necromancers guarding the next room. Examine the arcane enchanter for a copy of the Enchanting skill book Enchanter's Primer, then activate the pull chain and either dodge or destroy the spellcaster traps. The final room is guarded by three necromancers and contains the chest with the flute, a black soul gem, and a locked cage containing a dead body. After taking the flute, jump down from the ledge and exit the cave the way you came in. Back in the Bards College, Pantea will be overwhelmed with joy and will teach you a few tricks she learned while playing for the Winterhold wizards, specifically a one-point boost to all your Magic skills, including Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Enchanting, Illusion, and Restoration."

Once in Tel Mithryn, Neloth can be asked about where to find this Black Book.  (Start this conversation with him only if you are prepared to immediately follow him at the end of the conversation, to avoid a bug that stops progress.)  He replies: ""You refer to the tomes of esoteric knowledge that old Hermaeus Mora has scattered throughout the world? What could you know of them?"" Two or more possible dialogue choices will be presented, however the specific ones that appear are based on certain variables, such as the status of the Daedric quest Discerning the Transmundane: Your Dialogue  Neloth's Reply  Condition   The Black Books have something to do with Hermaeus Mora?  ""You didn't know? Hmm, I thought it was obvious. Hermaeus Mora has always tried to seduce mortals into his service with the lure of forbidden knowledge. Where the Black Books actually came from... no one really knows. Some appear to have been written in the past, others might be from the future. Apparently time is more malleable if you're a Daedric Prince of fate and destiny.""  Default choice   I found a Black Book. I need to find more.  ""Found one? Yes, and you read it, too, didn't you? Don't try to deny it, you've got the look. I can see it now. Dangerous knowledge is still knowledge and therefore useful. Usually turns out to be the most useful, in my experience.""  A Black Book has been found.   I've dealt with Hermaeus Mora before. I've read the Oghma Infinium.  Have you? The actual Oghma Infinium? That's... I've searched for it myself for many years without success...Well then, you should know better than anyone that Hermaeus Mora is not to be trifled with. But he is subtler than most of the other Daedric Princes, as you would expect of the prince of knowledge and fate. You seem to have escaped the fate of many who find themselves ensnared forever by the lure of his secrets. Or... perhaps not.""  Discerning the Transmundane has been completed.   Who is Hermaeus Mora?  ""If you have to ask that, you'd probably be best leaving his books to wiser heads than yours. Like all Daedric Princes, he's not to be trifled with. But he is subtler than most of his ilk, appropriate for the prince of knowledge and fate. Many scholars and loremasters have been ensnared by the lure of learning the secrets that only Hermaeus Mora possesses. But don't worry. I have no intention of joining them in their endless search through the infinite halls of Apocrypha.""  Discerning the Transmundane has not been completed After this, the conversation follows with: I have to know what Miraak knows if I want to stop him: ""Now that is a dangerous path indeed. Hermaeus Mora gives nothing away for free. You may end up like Miraak, of course. Two power-mad Dragonborn. It could be very interesting.""  Next, the conversation moves towards the Black Books where he admits owning one and knows the location of another: Do you know where I can find another Black Book?: ""Oh yes. They're not hard to locate once you know how to look for them. I have one here that I have been using to locate more."" You have a Black Book? ""Yes I haven't been idle while this fascinating madness engulfed Solstheim. But my book isn't what you're looking for. I'm quite sure it is unconnected with this Miraak. But I do know where to find a Black Book that can help you."" Next, two dialogue choices are presented: So you know where to find this Black Book? The one connected with Miraak?: ""Yes I do. I haven't been able to get it, though. But maybe together we can unlock the secrets the Dwemer left behind."" The Dwemer? What do they have to do with this?: ""Forbidden knowledge was somewhat a specialty of the dwarves, eh? You don't think they would just leave it alone, do you? It seems the ancient Dwemer discovered this book and took it to study. I have found their ""reading room"" in the ruins of Nchardak. The book is there, but it's sealed in a protective case which I wasn't able to open. But perhaps the two of us together will be able to get the book. To Nchardak, then. Follow me."" Just tell me where the book is and I'll go get it: ""I'm afraid it isn't that simple. If it was, I would have the book already."" Why won't the book you have here help me?: ""Oh, it clearly is not associated with the same power that has overtaken the island. And I'm not talking about Hermaeus Mora. These Black Books are all his, of course. No, what you're looking for is a specific book. Presumably because Miraak's power derives from it."" This ends the conversation and Neloth heads off to the ruins of Nchardak, located just north of Tel Mithryn, along the coast. City of a Hundred Towers[edit] ""Nchardak, The 'City of a Hundred Towers'. In its day it was the largest of the great Dwemer Archives and perhaps the most advanced."" ""The Dwemer certainly knew how to build for the ages. These towers have outlasted their creators by millenia [sic]."" Once you reach the outskirts of Nchardak with Neloth, he will remark: ""The Dwemer certainly knew how to build for the ages. These towers have outlasted their creators by millenia [sic]. The book is housed inside that dome. I'll need to unlock the door for us. Let's get on with it."". If Frea accompanies you, she will comment: ""The Skaal have always avoided ruins such as these. Nothing of the All-Maker is to be found within."". There will be a band of reavers camped outside of the ruins that must be defeated first. Upon spotting them, Neloth cries: ""I had to clean out the riff-raff last time I was here, too. Where do they come from?"". Once they are dealt with head up to the main door. Neloth remarks: ""Maybe now we can finally begin what we came here for."". He then walks up to the main door and reveals that he sealed the ruins on his last visit: ""The Dwemer of Nchardak appear to have been fond of these control pedestals. Luckily I found a cube to operate it inside on my last visit. I sealed the door when I left to keep out ignorant meddlers. Let me unlock it."" Nchardak Reading Room[edit] Once inside, follow Neloth towards a large gold ring in the center of the room where the Black Book is held. He explains: ""You can see the book right there. So tantalizingly close...But trust me, no magic will open that. I'd have had the book already if I could. No, we'll have to do this the hard way. If we can restore the steam supply to this room, I'm certain I can open it. As you'll see, that's easier said than done. This way to the boilers."" Next, Neloth uses his control cube to open another door where an elevator leading to the Nchardak Great Chamber is located. Follow him down the elevator into the next area. Nchardak Great Chamber[edit] ""There seems to be an inexhaustible supply of these Dwemer contraptions."" Upon entering, Neloth reveals: ""The last time I was here, I only explored a small part of the ruins. I was here alone then, and I find an assistant is absolutely essential for this kind of dirty, dangerous work."" as he walks down the stairs. When you get to a fork, Neloth will go to the left, but to the right there's a hole that you can drop into to find a chest. Upon reaching the main chamber, Neloth exclaims: ""Nchardak, The 'City of a Hundred Towers'. In its day it was the largest of the great Dwemer Archives and perhaps the most advanced. In the old stories, when the Nords came to conquer it, it's said the Dwemer sumberged the entire city beneath the sea until the invaders gave up. I have my doubts. But the city was a marvel of Dwemer engineering. Now... reduced to this."" If you have brought Frea with you, she'll remark: ""Amazing to think that they built this so long ago, and it still survives."" Follow Neloth to a control pedestal overlooking a large flooded area where he activates the pumps with his cube. As the water begins to drains, he reveals: ""The pumps only operate when a cube is in the pedestal. And unfortunately, I have only one cube. These four boilers provide steam to the room upstairs. They're shut down, but they still respond to the control cubes. So, if we can find four more cubes, we can turn these boilers back on and restore steam power to the room upstairs. Then I should be able to open the book's protective case. Bring that cube. We'll need it."" Pick up the control cube from the pedestal and follow Neloth over to a display panel that he begins to study. He reveals: ""Yes... here we are. This device shows the location of four more cubes in this section of the city. It looks like most of the cubes were moved to the lower levels, perhaps to try to control the flooding before the city was abandoned. Interesting. That would suggest that the city must have originally sunk during the first cataclysm of Red Mountain. Or that the Dwemer's servitors continued to try to preserve the city after their creators' disappearance."" Before entering the Nchardak Workshop, he remarks ""Three of the cubes are through here. This seems like a sensible place to start. You should be able to unseal this door with the control cube I gave you."" Once you place the cube in the control switch, the large brass seal that covers the door retracts and Neloth heads into the workshop. If you neglected to pick up the cube, he'll mention: ""You'll need a cube to unlock this door. I hope you remembered to pick up the cube I placed in the pedestal."" At this point it's possible to ask him to explain the details again, via two dialogue options. These are: How do we get the book out of its case?: ""It won't be easy. The whole lower part of the city is flooded, which has shut down the boilers which supply steam to the reading room. If we can restore the steam supply, I'm certain I can open the book's protective case."" Why do we need these cubes?: ""I thought I made myself clear the first time. The boilers in the Great Hall provide steam to the reading room upstairs, which we need in order to open the book's protective case. We need a total of five cubes - one to operate the pumps in the Great Hall, the other four to activate the boilers."" Nchardak Workshop[edit] ""Much of the Dwemer army at the Battle of Red Mountain must have come from here."" ""These must be the ""Great Workshops of Nchardak"". Upon entering, follow Neloth over to a nearby control switch that contains a cube. He remarks: ""I hope the rest of the cubes are this easy to find. Although knowing the Dwemer, I rather doubt it."". The cube also controls the jets of fire in the next hallway. If Frea is present, she'll tell you ""It would be madness to go through there."". If you continue without taking the cube, Neloth will note: ""Wouldn't it be easier just to turn off the trap? Like so?"" and take the cube. Then follow Neloth down to the next area. Dwarven spiders will be found down here; once they have been dealt with head over to a bridge stretching over another flooded area. Several Dwarven centurions can be seen lining the walls of this chamber. Follow Neloth as he remarks: ""These must be the ""Great Workshops of Nchardak"". Impressive even in ruins. In the city's days of glory, it was reputed to be able to assemble a complete automaton in a single day. Much of the Dwemer army at the Battle of Red Mountain must have come from here."". Even Frea will admit: ""It is rather impressive."" Walk over the bridge to reach two control pedestals. Neloth remarks: ""It looks like we'll need to lower the water level to make any more progress."" Place a cube in either pedestal to lower the water level; however this also results in a few Dwarven automatons appearing. Once they have been defeated, proceed down to the ground level and place a cube in the control switch to expand a set of stone stairs. Next, head up and around the walkway to the small brass bridge and place the cube in a second control switch to raise the bridge. Next, walk up the stairs and head left at the intersection to reach a brass gate. Open the gate and take the control cube that can be found behind it. Picking up the cube will result in the water level rising again, and Neloth will start to make a comment about how unfortunate this is. However, taking the cube also causes some Dwarven spiders to appear nearby, so Neloth's statement will almost certainly be cut short. Defeat the spiders and make your way back to the top of the room. Pick up the cube you left on a pedestal, which will result in the water level rising much higher than it was originally. Then proceed to the door on the southern side of the room. Neloth will remark, ""Let's see where this leads"", as he follows you through the door and into a narrow corridor which descends into a shallow, collapsed obstruction. If the first cube on the bridge was not collected, Neloth will state ""There's a passage up there. We could reach it if the water level was higher."" Otherwise, he will say: ""With the water level this high, we can swim across the collapsed part of the passage and reach the other side."". Swim through and defeat any Dwarven spiders and Dwarven ballistae that appear in this section. At the end of the hall the fourth cube can be found on a pedestal. Taking this cube will result in the water level rising yet again, and a Dwarven centurion awakening from its gantry. Once it's been dealt with, walk up the small staircase near the Centurion and activate the control switch, lowering a bridge which leads back toward the Great Chamber. Return to the Great Chamber[edit] Upon arrival in the Great Chamber, Neloth will walk over to the large flooded section and explain that the last cube is through the northern door, however the water must be completely drained in order to proceed. Place two cubes on the pedestals on the upper area to drain the water. Dispatch the automatons triggered by the cube placement, and follow Neloth down the curved pathway towards the northern passage. Two Dwarven ballista are guarding the northern door; once they are dealt with ascend the short staircase activate the control switch on the left side of the doorway, then open the large brass seal and head into the Nchardak Aqueduct. Nchardak Aqueduct[edit] ""I'd guess that must be the pump activator up there. But how to reach it?"" Follow Neloth until he spots several raised bridges and remarks: ""Looks like we'll need those bridges down in order to get the pumps in here working."" As he walks deeper into the chamber, he adds: ""The last cube is somewhere in here. I hope it won't require more swimming around in this filth."", which is answered by Frea with ""You should leave slogging around in the muck to us youngsters."" if she is present. Eventually, Neloth spots a small alcove on the upper floor and says: ""I'd guess that must be the pump activator up there. But how to reach it? We'll need to get all three of these bridges down in order to reach the pump control."" Turn around and walk up the ramp to an upper platform with three control switches overlooking the aqueduct. The sequence to lower all three bridges is the right switch, then the left switch. Once the correct combination is entered, and all three bridges lowered, Frea will congratulate you with ""I think you did it."", and Neloth will snap: ""That's it! Don't touch anything else. Quickly now."" before running across the bridges. To the south of the control switches is an apprentice-locked chest and a dwarven warhammer to loot. Cross the bridges and defeat the Dwarven automatons that appear. The control pedestal is located on the upper platform on the eastern side of the room. Activating it with a cube will drain the water, allowing access to the last chamber. As the water begins to lower, Neloth comes up with a plan for the final cube: ""I have an idea. I'll wait here and retrieve this cube once you find the last one we need. Good luck!"". If Frea is around, she will comment: ""Finally. We will not have to listen to his complaining."" Head down to floor level and find the control pedestal on the left side of a large bronze doorway on the western side of the room, on the opposite wall from the platform you used to lower the water level. Insert the cube to open the brass seal, then through the tunnels to reach a small room lined with traps. The first trap is a pressure plate activated set of iron bars that slam shut near the entrance. Next are two spinning blades in front of the gate that holds the final cube. Use Whirlwind Sprint to dart across them and place a cube in the control pedestal on the right hand side of the gates to turn off the blades and open the doors. Be careful here as there is yet another pressure plate which activates poisoned darts just before the pedestal. Taking the last cube will raise the water level. Swim back to the aqueduct chamber, where Neloth will be waiting. Once he sees the final cube has been obtained, he will greet you with ""Do you have the cube? Good, good! Then I'll take this cube and we can be on our way."" and remove the control cube from the pump activator. He then will warn you: ""Watch out, the water's rising even higher with both pumps shut down."", which Frea responds to with sarcasm: ""Thanks for the warning."". Neloth will then say, ""That was easier than I expected. I'm glad you were here to do all the hard work. With the cubes I retrieved, we should now have a total of five. I hope you haven't left more scattered about. With the cube I retrieved from the pumping pedestal, we should now have five cubes - exactly what we need. Now we can finally see about getting those boilers started."". Frea will then again express her skepticism toward Neloth: ""Now we will see if he knows what he is talking about."" Before leaving, swim and climb to the northeast chamber of the Aqueduct, just north of where Neloth was waiting by the pump control pedestal. A Dwarven Ballista guards the chamber. There is a table in the room with the Kagrumez resonance gem, a weapon, a piece of armor, and some Dwemer scrap laying on it. There is also a chest on the table with loot. There is more Dwemer scrap under the table, and on a shelf on the south side of the room. The resonance gem might fall to the ground during the battle with the Ballista. Be sure to check before abandoning the room if it isn't on the table with the chest as it is very small and easy to miss.  Return to the southern door and pass through to meet Neloth in the Nchardak Great Chamber. Activate the Boilers[edit] Head up the ramp to the main control pedestals. Pick up one of the original cubes already in the pedestals and head down to the lower platform. Place the remaining four cubes in the boiler pedestals to start the boiler. As the boilers are activated, Neloth comments: ""That seems to have done it. Good. It took longer than I'd hoped, but at least it's finally done. "" but then cries out ""Look out! Another Steam Centurion!"" as a Dwarven centurion awakens from its station at the far side of the great chamber bridge. Once it has been dealt with, he remarks: ""I'm going to head back upstairs and see if the reading room has steam. If so, it should be a simple matter to release the book."" Before heading back to the Nchardak Reading Room, you may wish to head over the bridge to the centurion's holding cage, where a boss-level chest can be found. Note: leave the activation cubes in the control pedestals. The Black Book[edit] ""At last. I hope it was worth it. Please... be my guest. You deserve the first look."" ""Aren't you going to read it? I thought that was the whole reason you dragged me out here."" Upon reaching the reading room, Neloth will be waiting by the control pedestal, where he remarks: ""Now that the boilers are working, it should be simple to release the book from it's [sic] protective case."" Press the button on the pedestal to cause four beams of light to shine up from the floor and focus on a large crystal above. This also causes the room to rumble and the Black Book to rise up from the floor. Neloth remarks: ""At last. I hope it was worth it. Please... be my guest. You deserve the first look. Besides, it could be very dangerous. These books are known to drive many people insane."" The Black Book is revealed to be Epistolary Acumen. As you begin to read the book and enter the realm of Apocrypha, Neloth jokingly parts with: ""Oh good. Be sure to say hello to Hermaeus Mora for me if you see him."". This begins the next quest: The Gardener of Men. Reward[edit] Once the quest is completed, the Black Book Epistolary Acumen will be accessible. The book grants one of three abilities once Apocrypha has been traversed: Dragonborn Force, Dragonborn Flame, or Dragonborn Frost. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: The Path of Knowledge (20 points/Bronze)"

Kill the Vampire Naturalist in Cronvangr Cave and rescue the tame spider. Find the tame skeever within the Ratway and the key to unlock its cage.","A trained goat is for sale in Whiterun Hold Goat for Sale[edit] In The Bannered Mare in Whiterun, a For Sale notice can be found at the counter. It is advertising for the sale of Hilda, a trained pack goat in Rorikstead. Journey to Rorikstead and locate Halvar in order to purchase the goat. Halvar is a farmhand who can be found working the field beside Cowflop Farmhouse. He will sell Hilda for 200 gold, at which point it will act as your follower and can be given various orders such as instructions to wait at a specified city or player house. Upon purchasing Hilda, you will be prompted to read Halvar's Journal to find out more about the goat. It can be found on Halvar's bedroll next to the field. Reading it will reveal that Halvar had come across many other tame animals in his travels, and your journal will update with objectives to track down each of them. They can be found and rescued in any order you wish.  Sweet Roll stands over the body of its former master A Bosmer and His Fox[edit] In the forest south-southwest of Half-Moon Mill, you will come across a collared fox named Sweet Roll standing over the body of a Bosmer thief. If you are having trouble finding it, stand beside the pile of rocks (the cairn) at the north end of the bridge and walk south; cross over the stream on foot; he is located right over the hill at about a total of 37 running steps from the cairn.  A detect dead spell will show one blue and two red bodies. The thief was probably killed by wolves, as evidenced by the scattered arrows and the two wolf carcasses surrounding him. His body can be looted for some ill-gotten treasure as well as the Thief's Journal. Reading the journal will reveal that the fox has a penchant for sweet rolls (thus the name). It will refuse to interact with you until you have a sweet roll in your inventory, at which point you can feed and tame it. Fortunately, the thief has five sweet rolls on his body. Alchemist Bunny[edit] A tame rabbit named Thistle can be found at the abandoned Alchemist's Shack in the mountain pass south of Ivarstead. The nearby Notes on Tamed Rabbit will reveal that Thistle enjoys carrots. A trough of carrots can be found right next to the rabbit, making it a simple matter to feed and tame it.  Some vampires prefer the taste of fear, others the taste of pain The Taste of Pain[edit] You will be led to the hidden vampire lair within the spider-infested Cronvangr Cave in order to obtain a pet frostbite spider named Arachnia. It has been tamed by a Vampire Naturalist, who is using it to harvest vast amounts of venom for the purpose of torturing her victims before she drinks their blood. Kill the vampire and loot the Spider Cage Key from her corpse in order to free Arachnia from its cage. You can also loot the Vampire Naturalist's Journal for some background information on her experiments. Once the cage is opened, Arachnia is yours.  Free Skritch from a grisly fate A Skooma-Sucker's Dinner[edit] Within the Ratway beneath Riften, you will come across a tame skeever named Skritch found locked in a cage. You can find the body of its owner just across from the entrance to The Ragged Flagon: a failed pickpocket who planned to catch skeevers for food but decided to train one instead for use as a distraction. Loot the Skeever Cage Key from his corpse and open the cage in order to rescue Skritch and claim the animal as your own. You can also read the Pickpocket's Journal for optional background information. Pets of Skyrim[edit] Once you've obtained the last of the 5 pets, the quest concludes. Like other Creation Club pets, each one can obey a range of orders and each also has its own distinct attribute. Arachnia can place paralysis web traps and provide  Potent Frostbite Venom; Hilda can provide Jugs of Milk; Skritch can locate or provide food items; Sweet Roll can locate or provide loot; and Thistle can locate plants which can be harvested for ingredients. Some of the pets can also be equipped with an Animal Collar or an Animal Pack, two items added by Pets of Skyrim; indeed, Hilda is already wearing a pack, and Sweet Roll a collar. The collar is simply aesthetic, but the pack provides a real benefit by increasing the pet's carrying capacity by 40. Each time you get a pet a new ""Teleport: <Pet's Name>"" appears. This can be used to retrieve your lost pet if it ever gets ""misplaced""."

Kill Silus to retrieve the Razor or let him escape.","Receiving the Quest[edit] Sometime after you reach level 20, a courier will deliver to you the Dawnstar museum pamphlet, announcing the opening of the museum and noting that admission is free. This activates the miscellaneous quest, ""Visit the museum in Dawnstar"". Alternatively, at or above level 20, you may initiate this quest by speaking to Silus Vesuius outside his home in Dawnstar. Visit the Museum[edit] ""And here comes my first visitor. The Museum of the Mythic Dawn is open, friend."" Travel to Dawnstar and go to Silus Vesuius's house, only to hear the house owner and Dawnstar's court wizard, Madena, arguing: Madena: ""Your ancestors wouldn't want this, Silus!"" Silus: ""Why should I hide from it? This is my family's legacy!"" Madena: ""It's the past! Dead oaths on dead lips. Let it stay there."" Silus: ""The museum is opening, Madena."" You may talk to Madena for a concise history on Silus' family or ignore her and speak to Silus, who will warmly welcome you and offer you a tour of the museum, after which he will ask you to retrieve the three pieces of Mehrunes' Razor. If you accept, he will give you The Keepers of the Razor which contains his notes about the Razor, including information on the locations of the pieces. The quest will initiate in your journal and the location for each piece will appear on your map. If you return to Silus at the museum in Dawnstar after obtaining each piece, he will reward you with gold and tell you that he needs any remaining parts. However, you may also wait and return all three pieces together. Retrieve the Pommel[edit] The pommel of Mehrunes' Razor is at Dead Crone Rock, southwest of Markarth. Getting to Dead Crone Rock[edit] Due to the mountainous terrain, navigating there from Markarth can be frustrating (or adventuresome, depending on your attitude). If the destination is selected as your current objective, the Clairvoyance spell serves as a reliable supplement to your compass. Once you have arrived in the environs of Hag Rock Redoubt, both your compass and Clairvoyance will keep sending you in circles through the redoubt. Your actual goal is above the redoubt and you may not get a compass indicator until you have actually entered Dead Crone Rock. Exit Markarth by the eastern gate and proceed eastwards along the road. Passing the first bridge over the river to your right, proceed on the main road and cross the bridge toward Whiterun, as indicated by the signpost. Shortly thereafter, take an easily-seen dirt path to the right. After a short way, where the rocky cliffs on both sides of the path drop back and water can be seen ahead, you will likely encounter randomly-generated enemies. This sometimes involves some kind of group or individual battling another; if so, allowing the fighting to complete can thin out some of your enemies before you are engaged. You may deal with anything from a pack of wolves fighting a stray dog, to a group of bandits, to a spriggan and possibly their usual consorts, to bands of Forsworn Briarhearts attended by mages. If you do not witness a battle, one is likely to have just finished, so after you have dealt with whatever attacks you, you may wish to take a look around the area for corpses to loot. Continuing on, you may next encounter an animal or two, such as a bear, which may be dead, hibernating on or near the road, or aggressive. Soon thereafter, you will reach the Orc stronghold Dushnikh Yal where the guard Nagrub will engage you in dialogue if you get close enough, leading to any of a number of outcomes. You may avoid this conversation and discovery of the stronghold if you wish: Just before reaching the stronghold, take a sharp right around the stone outcropping (this turn is not always easily seen on approach), and follow the path as it continues in this direction. At the first right turn, an iron ore vein sits directly in front of you. The path ahead is sometimes difficult to follow. Wind along it until you reach a bridge crossing a river. You can take the path on your left just before reaching the bridge and discover Purewater Run if desired. You will see part of Hag Rock Redoubt on the far (western) side. After crossing the bridge, there is a choice to make about your route. Whichever you choose, you will need to pass through at least some part of the heavily-guarded exterior zone of Hag Rock Redoubt to reach Dead Crone Rock. Both ways will involve some serious battles, but one will pit you against fewer enemies than the other. There is also a shortcut. The Easy Way[edit] There is a shortcut that can bypass the dangerous part of Hag Rock Redoubt and deliver you to the door of Dead Crone Rock without needing to battle any enemies. To go this way, take the path to the left before you pass under the arch. Leave any follower in that area. After climbing the second set of steps, continue straight ahead and up the hillside to the rocky cliff. Bear right, and stay close to the cliff to your left. Use your compass to point you toward the Dead Crone Rock icon. As you near Dead Crone Rock, you will reach a wall that's been artificially cut from the mountain. Take a right here, and make a jump. Then get into sneak mode. Head west and then up a flight of steps to your left (south). If you have been spotted, it will have been by at least one difficult enemy, such as a Forsworn Briarheart, and a troll or giant frostbite spider. You can sprint straight ahead up the stairs to the door and enter. No enemy will follow you in. Skip down to Dead Crone Rock. The Hard Way[edit] Take the left fork in the path just prior to passing under a stone arch. Your goal is to reach the entry door to the interior of Hag Rock Redoubt before encountering any enemies. Follow the path, ascending two small sets of stone steps. Proceed through a stone archway and then straight ahead to the door. Enter and contend with some leveled Forsworn and probably a mage or two. Many of these can be dispatched with sneak/bow attacks, but it may be wise to poison your weapon and prepare for some fairly powerful attacks. Follow your compass to the top of the zone. You will face the heaviest fighting near the exit from at the top of a circular staircase. To minimize the number of strong enemies, stay to the west as much as possible once you emerge from it. When all is clear, skip down to the section below, ""Dead Crone Rock."" The Harder Way[edit] Forsworn guarding the way to Dead Crone Rock There are two difficult routes through Hag Rock Redoubt. These do not involve traveling through its interior zone. To experience the greatest number of powerful enemies simultaneously, proceed up the left fork of the path as in the preceding paragraph, but go straight past the entry door to the ruin. Soon after you pass the door, a large number of enemies will become alert to your presence (and more will be on the way). These will involve leveled Forsworn, mages, and probably a frost or storm atronach. When this area is clear, find the dome-shaped hut ahead containing an alchemy table. If you are ready for more, you can turn to the east, cross the bridge, and fight your way down a short tower back to the fork in the path from which you began this part of the trip. You can alternatively leave these alone and proceed onward as described in the second paragraph below. Alternatively, instead of taking the fork to the left, proceed straight, pass under the stone archway, and enter the short tower after battling its defenders.  Once you have entered the structure, climb upwards. After the first flight of stone steps is a flight of wooden steps. It is easy to get stuck if you stray off of the wooden platform at its base. In fact, there are multiple places around the area in which you may become stuck. For this reason, as well as mass of powerful enemies you will confront, you may wish to save frequently. At the top of the tower, cross the bridge to the west. Near its midpoint a large number of enemies will begin to attack you, including leveled Forsworn, mages, and probably a frost or storm atronach. You will face about the same number of enemies as if you took the route described in the paragraph immediately above, but somewhat more sequentially. Next, you will ascend several sets of wide, impressive stairs generally to the west of the small round hut containing an alchemy table. At the base of the second staircase lies a trap activated by a tripwire that will release boulders from an overhead arch. With good luck or exquisite planning, this can be used against yet another set of enemies who await just above. These will comprise a number of powerful attackers simultaneously, including perhaps a Forsworn Briarheart, a mage, and a troll, each capable of dealing out very powerful attacks. Dead Crone Rock[edit] Drascua carrying the pommel stone of Mehrunes' Razor Continue up the stairs to the west until they end; here the path turns you to the left and up one more short stairway to Dead Crone Rock. Once inside, ascend a series of tiers, battling Forsworn and mages along the way. At the top of the second flight of stairs, a metal gate must be unlocked by a lever in another room. To reach the lever, enter the room containing a long banquet table, on which sits an arcane enchanter, and continue past the fire trap. Deactivate this trap by taking the soul gem from which the flames emanate. Enter the short, dark hallway to access a small room containing the lever. A pressure plate activating another fire trap awaits the unwary on the floor of this hall. A copy of the Alchemy skill book A Game at Dinner sits in front of the lever. The locked wooden door on this level leads to a small external balcony area containing some loot. Continue upwards to the pinnacle of the ruin, where Drascua, the ruin's hagraven leader, possesses the pommel. Obtain it, and then find the word wall behind a large altar. A Stone of Barenziah and two soul gems bedeck the altar. A chest near one of its corners contains some valuables. Retrieve the Blade Shards[edit] The Razor's blade shards are held in the basement vault of Cracked Tusk Keep, a fort occupied by Orc bandits. Getting to Cracked Tusk Keep[edit] The keep is located west of Falkreath and just west-southwest of the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary. On foot from the Guardian Stones: If you have not discovered Falkreath and prefer a trek to a carriage ride to Falkreath, you can travel on foot or horseback from the Guardian Stones, located southwest of Riverwood. The following guide traces the Clairvoyance spell pathing, which serves as a reliable guide. Take the road uphill then bear right at the fork you will soon encounter. The section of road running alongside Lake Ilinalta borders several caves and barrows/ruins, setting off a number of encounters with the likes of animals, particularly wolves; monsters, particularly frostbite spiders; groups of leveled bandits, likely including bandits who may cast shock spells; hostile Orcs; and vampires who are often present on or close to the road, searching for fresh blood from their lair in the nearby North Shriekwind Bastion ruin. If trouble does not find you in this area, you won't need to look far to find some. If you shoot first and ask questions later, however, you may find yourself having committed the crime of murder, as non-hostile characters may also be encountered here. One spot in which you are likely to encounter someone or something is just past the large boulder positioned on the right side of the road where it departs from the lakeside. There is an iron ore vein here: Westwards from the boulder extends a patch of rocks sited between the road and the river in an essentially rectangular formation. The vein lies at the northwest corner of this. Continue west, then take a left turn onto another road. This has no signpost and can be overlooked if you're not watching for it. Follow this road as it winds to the bottom of a hill. Just after it reaches the bottom and levels out, take a smaller path to the right. This is intermittently paved with flagstones and will soon point you directly at the Keep.  Cracked Tusk Keep[edit] ""Looking for the blade? You aren't the first!"" The Keep's exterior is relatively lightly guarded by orcs and bandits, typically of the bandit archer class, who tend to attack with bows from a distance and melee weapons up-close. They are better-trained in one-handed weapons and so can be more dangerous when wielding them. They are non-magical. A surgical sniping approach may be accomplished by sneaking around a wide arc to the right of the fort and climbing the mountain from the other side. You should have any follower wait before you find a way to climb up. It may require luck, patience and persistence to find a way up and over that lands you in a position from which you can see and kill one or more guards below. If you can do so, and then sneak into the interior through one of several vulnerabilities in the perimeter, it is possible to eliminate all of the guards without any of them even seeing you. The access point of choice is probably a deteriorated breach in the wall located on the north wall near the northeast corner. Climbing up here will allow you to reach an elevated wooden platform from which you can sometimes see and kill remaining guards. (Another breach near this corner but on the east side allows you to access a partially-buried chest, but presents a more difficult if not impossible route inside.) There are three entrances into the keep's first interior zone. If you take the front door, you will be immediately attacked by two enemies of the same type as the guards. Incapacitate them and proceed up the stairs and through the door, where the bandit chief, Ghunzul wields more advanced melee weaponry, and wears stronger heavy armor as well as the key to the vault. There is a second vault key on the chest next to his bed. A second entrance is a hatch on the roof of the circular structure at the southeast corner of the exterior which will drop you directly into Ghunzul's quarters. To find it, take the stairs to the right just after entering the exterior gate to the fort. Work your way around the walls and elevated platforms of the perimeter counter-clockwise until you reach it. This will require a tricky jump at one point which can land you in an area where you may become stuck. If you obtain the key, proceed two levels down to enter Cracked Tusk Vaults. The shards of Mehrunes' Razor The third entrance is a locked door to the right of the main entrance and down some steps. This opens directly into the unguarded room which accesses the vault zone. If you have sufficient lockpicking capabilities, it can allow you to access the vault and the quest item without encountering any enemies in the interior. There is a sliding panel on the wall to the right of the cage barring access to Cracked Tusk Vaults. It can be opened with the key or by picking a difficult lock. Open the next door. Two barred rooms on either side of the hallway, each containing significant loot, are unlocked by small buttons on the wall to the right of each. The room to the left contains a copy of the light armor skill book Rislav The Righteous. Activating the levers to the left and right of the final barrier will open the way to the blade shards. Three tripwires on the floor between you and the shards activate dart traps; these may be jumped over. Removing the blade shards from their pedestal will also activate a dart trap. Placing something, like the nearby bucket, onto the pedestal will deactivate the trap—if you can get something to remain on the surface of the pedestal. Using Telekinesis from a safe distance is also possible. However, you may also turn to the left as you face the pedestal, and take an alternative route back through the room. Other options include simply taking some damage from the traps or using the Become Ethereal shout to protect yourself on the way back out.  Retrieve the Hilt[edit] Jorgen, owner of the hilt of Mehrunes' Razor To get the hilt, speak to Jorgen in the town of Morthal. He will initially claim not to have it, and when he admits that he does, he will refuse to give it to you. To gain access to it, you may use one of the speech challenges: threaten, persuade, or bribe. You must pass a hard-level Speech check to persuade him; bribing him does not require such a high skill level. Option  Dialogue  Reaction   You won't miss it, then. (Persuade) Passed: You want the hilt that bad? Fine. Here's the keys. It's locked in a chest inside my house.Failed: I don't care, but my ancestors do. You can't have it.

It's locked in a chest inside my house.Failed: Why don't you take your coin and keep walking? Passed: Retrieve the HiltFailed: Nothing   Give me the hilt, or things get ugly. (Intimidate) Passed: Easy. Here. These are the keys. The hilt is in a chest in my house, just don't hurt anyone.Failed: You want a fight? You got it. Passed: Retrieve the HiltFailed: Brawl   Never mind, then. Best leave the past buried, I say. Nothing If successful, he will give you the key to his house west of the mill and another to the chest within it containing the hilt. You can also just take the hilt from the chest without speaking to Jorgen by picking the locks or pickpocketing the key(s) from Jorgen.  Silus Vesuius, trying to invoke Mehrunes Dagon Completing the Quest[edit] After retrieving the three pieces, return to Silus and he will pay you a leveled amount of gold for each and then ask you to meet him at the Shrine of Mehrunes Dagon. Once he is gone, if you wish to read the Mythic Dawn Commentaries, located inside the locked display cases at Silus' house, this may be your only time to do so without him present unless you decide to kill him at the shrine. Once you are done inside travel to the shrine. Upon arrival, Silus will be unable to get Dagon to repair the Razor, so he will ask you to interact with the shrine. When you do, the Daedric Prince will manifest and demand that you kill Silus. Silus will ask you to spare him in return for 500 gold, saying that he will place the pieces of the Razor in a display case in his house. You then have two choices:  Silus, attacked by two Dremora The pieces of Mehrunes' Razor, sealed in a display case Leave Silus alive If you accept, he will give you the gold and run back to his house taking the broken dagger with him, while Dagon summons two Dremora to kill you and Silus.  ""I'm not dying without a fight!"" The reforging of Mehrunes' Razor Kill Silus If you choose to kill Silus, interact with the shrine after you kill him and Dagon will fix the Razor for you. After you take it the quest will end, but Dagon will still summon two Dremora to try to kill you as ""one final test"". If you just wait long enough without answering Silus, his nerve will break and he will attack you instead. When you kill him, Dagon will react the same as if you had attacked him.  After completing this quest you can gain access to the interior of the shrine after taking a key from one of the Dremora that Mehrunes Dagon sends to attack you. Inside the shrine, you will encounter two more Dremora. Once they are killed, you will find in the shrine a room full of treasure."

Return to Alessandra.","A Daughter's Path[edit] Alessandra is the priestess of Arkay in Riften. She tends the Hall of the Dead, located beneath the Temple of Mara, by herself. When you speak with her, you will note a certain bitterness about her position: ""I didn't ask for this job, I got stuck with it thanks to my father."" Her father was a Priest of Arkay and it was his desire that she follow his footsteps. As a result, her entire life has been spent around the dead, learning the proper burial rituals and prayers. While she seems to have accepted her lot in life, albeit reluctantly, she feels the need to make peace with her father. Unfortunately, her father did not live to see his daughter become a priest. Alessandra holds her father's ceremonial dagger as well as the one she received when she did complete the training. She asks you to journey to the Hall of the Dead in Whiterun (see Bugs) to place her ceremonial dagger with her father's remains, fulfilling her honor-bound obligation to him and making peace with his memory. The dagger needs to be delivered to Andurs, the caretaker at the Whiterun Hall of the Dead, who will inter it with her father's remains. If you agree to help her deliver the dagger, she'll appreciate your help and entrust you with it. The Pilgrimage[edit] Travel to Whiterun and talk to Andurs in the Hall of the Dead.

(Optional) Use key to a stash of gold on lodge strongbox. Steal Frost's lineage papers. Steal Frost. Return to Louis Letrush.","See a Man About a Horse[edit] When visiting the Bee and Barb in Riften, a Breton bard named Louis Letrush will recruit you into doing a favor for him. Apparently, Louis has purchased a valuable horse named Frost from Sibbi Black-Briar. Unfortunately, Sibbi was locked up in the Riften Jail before the deal could be finalized. Louis asks you to discuss the situation with Sibbi in the jail, then deliver the horse and its lineage papers to him. Possession is Nine-Tenths of the Law[edit] At the jail, bribe or persuade the guard to be allowed in.  Visit Sibbi in his cell where he explains the whole story of how he ended up in jail. He also mentions that the horse he owes to Louis is not ""actually"" his; in fact, it's owned by the Black-Briar estate, namely Maven Black-Briar. However, Sibbi does not want to back out on the deal with Louis, so he offers you the second half of the payment owed if you steal Frost from Black-Briar Lodge. He also directs you to where the lineage papers are at the lodge. If you're feeling put upon, you can persuade Sibbi to give you the key to the lodge strongbox containing two-hundred fifty gold. Horse Rustling at the Black-Briar Lodge[edit] Frost located at the stables Make your way east of Riften to the Black-Briar Lodge. The lodge is heavily guarded, and the mercenary guards will attack on sight. The lodge doors are leveled, but can be opened using the Black-Briar Lodge Key that each guard carries. The easiest way to complete the in-lodge requirements is to kill or evade the outside mercenaries, then enter by the back door. This puts you on a level below, and mostly out of sight of, the dining room containing four mercenaries above. The reason for bothering with the upper level at all is to get the unusual gem in the master bedroom on the upper level. If your sneaking skills are high, you can just slink into the bedroom and grab the Stone. If not, or if you just want to kill all the mercenaries, your position as you come in by the back door is perfect, forcing the guards to funnel toward you down a long narrow hall, enabling you to snipe them one by one. To the right of the ladder in the basement is the lodge strongbox. The strongbox is master level but can be opened using Sibbi's stash key if you got it from him back at the jail. Around the corner, you will find Frost's lineage papers on a table. Take the papers and leave the lodge. Steal the horse named Frost and follow the road away from the lodge until you get close to Louis' quest marker, then cut north to meet him. There are bandits and spiders between the road and Louis, so be prepared to fight them and protect both Louis and Frost; if either dies, the quest will fail. A few well-timed save games will serve you well in case one of them dies. For your completion conversation with Louis, there are multiple options: Let him go with the horse and receive the leveled gold payment. He will then ride the horse to Whiterun Stables. It is possible though to receive the payment and then immediately steal the horse; the quest will count as finished without double-crossing Louis. Note that stealing the horse will make Louis attack you. Persuade him to give you the horse and the payment, threatening to tell Maven about everything. If this persuade check succeeds, he will give you the money and run away. Tell him that if he was dead, you could keep both the money and the horse. He may attack you or run away. The latter two will grant you Frost as a horse, although it won't appear in the statistics as a ""horse owned""; still, it behaves like an owned horse (helping in fights, waiting where you leave it, and so on), and more importantly, you can mount him in front of witnesses without it being considered stealing. (Possibly only if you have already told Maven): If you give Louis the horse, or if you blackmail him out of the money, as of the most recent patch Louis remains ""essential"" at this point, so you cannot cut Louis down as he flees with or without Frost (presumably this is to allow for the later encounter with him and thugs, whether they are his own thugs or Maven's). If you threaten to kill him, he may fight or he may run away, but either way he will be non-essential. (Striking him is considered an assault, but with Louis himself as the only witness, so your bounty will vanish when he dies, unless he runs far enough for someone else to witness his death.) Consequences[edit] If you persuade Louis into letting you keep Frost, a random event may occur in which a thug appears in front of you claiming to have a ""message"" from Louis, and then proceeds to attack you. This event may happen more than once. If you kill the Black-Briar Mercenaries and take Frost but do not bring the horse to Louis, you will eventually be tracked down by Black-Briar thugs who have a bounty on you. Kill them and you will find a note instructing them to ""deal with you"" (and kill if necessary). If you tell Maven and then deliver the horse to Louis, you may encounter a thug and Louis. The thug will kill Louis unless you intervene, and the survivor will attack you. If you deliver the horse to Louis without telling Maven, you may encounter a thug and Louis. Again, the thug will kill Louis unless you intervene, but he will then ignore you and walk away if you don't initiate combat.

Rescue the Moth Priest from Forebears' Holdout. Report back to Isran.","The Interrogation[edit] ""You're a resource. You're an asset."" Once you have recruited Sorine Jurard and Gunmar into the Dawnguard, and Isran has welcomed them to Fort Dawnguard, you are told to follow Isran for a little interrogation session with the newly arrived vampire, named Serana. When asked what she is doing in the enemy fort, she will explain: ""I'd rather not be here either, but I needed to talk to you. It's important, so please just listen before your friend, here, loses his patience. It's... well, it's about me. And the Elder Scroll that was buried with me. I'm guessing you figured this part out already, but my father's not exactly a good person. Even by vampire standards."" She then proceeds to explain that her father once was a better person but stumbled upon a prophecy that foretold vampires could control the sun, thus not be afraid of daylight. She finishes with: ""That's what he's after. He wants to control the sun, have vampires control the world."" Serana and her mother tried to stop him from taking over the world, so Serana was sealed away with the scroll, to keep it from her father. She realizes she is in a fort filled with vampire hunters, but agrees to try and persuade Isran to let her help. Once again, you will have to do the talking, although Isran will be his usual paranoid self: ""All right, you've heard what it has to say. Now tell me, is there any reason I shouldn't kill this bloodsucking fiend right now?"" Regardless of your choice, Isran will agree to let Serana help out, but will turn to Serana and let her know: ""Don't feel like a guest, because you're not. You're a resource. You're an asset. In the meantime, don't make me regret my sudden outburst of tolerance and generosity, because if you do, your friend here is going to pay for it."" While Serana can't help but make fun of Isran's anger, she will turn to you and remind you that she carries the Elder Scroll on her back and that it is necessary to read it to understand the prophecy. The only people who can read the scrolls are the blind Moth Priests who live in the Imperial City in Cyrodiil, a long way from Skyrim. Luckily, Isran noticed an Imperial scholar passing by on the road just a few days ago. He is unwilling to waste men looking for him, but suggests that you ask innkeepers or carriage drivers all over Skyrim. Serana, however, suggests the College of Winterhold as a place where a scholar would go. Either way, Serana feels adventurous and will be your follower on the search for the scholar. Searching for the Priest[edit] You will face three different options, either asking the numerous carriage drivers parked all over Skyrim, asking the innkeepers in the various cities, or taking a trip to the College of Winterhold. It is also possible to just wander around Skyrim; if you come to the area south of Dragon Bridge where the Moth Priest was kidnapped from, then you can continue on with the quest even if you haven't done this part. See the table below for a list of options, conditions, and dialogue: Option  Conditions  Dialogue   Carriage Drivers  All of them will provide information, although you will have to persuade them (with a Speech skill of 50), or successfully bribe them to get the information.

Failed: ""An' maybe it won't."" Never mind, I'll look somewhere else. ""Suits me just fine.""

It's important that I find him right away. (Persuade) Passed: ""Ah, well, in that case I'll tell you what I know. He took the road southwest out of town, and said he was going to be crossing over the Dragon Bridge. That's all that he told me. I hope it helps."" Failed: ""It's like I said, I'm not going to talk about it."" Finding that Moth Priest is worth a lot to me. (Bribe) Passed: ""I can see that. He said he was heading for Dragon Bridge next. I hope that helps you."" Failed: ""Sorry, but that Moth Priest's comings and goings are none of my business, and none of yours either."" I'll try my luck elsewhere. ""Never much cared for folks who can't mind their own business.""   College of Winterhold  The librarian in the Arcanaeum, Urag gro-Shub, will provide the information without any demands. Your rank at the College does not affect this, although certain College quests can temporarily block dialogue.  I need to find a Moth Priest. ""A Moth Priest? What in Oblivion do you need a Moth Priest for?""  My business is my own. Just tell me what I need to know. ""Fine, fine. No need to get your breeches in a twist. The obvious answer is to go to the Imperial City. The Moth Priests make their home in the White Gold Tower. Sometimes they go out looking for Elder Scrolls. Lucky for you, there's a Moth Priest in Skyrim right now, doing just that. He stopped in to do some research in the library, then left for Dragon Bridge. If you hurry, you might catch him there."" The Ambush at Dragon Bridge[edit] The ambush With all clues pointing to the small settlement of Dragon Bridge, travel there and ask the locals if they have seen a Moth Priest. Some will not even have the topic, while others will claim they know nothing about a traveling priest. Azzada and Michel Lylvieve will both suggest talking to a guard: ""A Moth Priest? I'm sorry, but I don't know anything about that. Try asking one of the guards."" Following their advice and asking a local guard will have him say: ""Ah, so that was a Moth Priest, then? He rode through town not long ago with an escort of soldiers. They didn't stop, just headed south across the Dragon Bridge."" The only other person  people who ever noticed a caravan traveling through town is young Clinton Lylvieve, who will tell you: ""I don't know what a Moth Priest is, but I did see an old man in a robe not long ago. He was riding in a wagon with some Imperial guards. They didn't stop to visit, though. They rode through town heading south, and went across the big bridge. It was only just a little bit ago. I bet you can catch them if you hurry up."" Head southeast out of town and cross the old bridge. Stay on the path and before long you will see signs of a roadside attack, an overturned cart, a dead horse, a bloodstained corpse, a copy of the book Effects of the Elder Scrolls, and a dead vampire. Examine the vampire and read the vampire's note. The note points you towards a place named Forebears' Holdout, apparently where the attackers dragged the Moth Priest. Follow the bloodstains over the bridge to the east until you reach yet another attacked cart, with two corpses: a Redguard and a Nord. Follow the blood spatters to the northeast until you reach five standing stones, and the entrance to Forebears' Holdout. Forebears' Holdout[edit] ""The more you fight me, the more you will suffer, mortal."" ""I serve my master's will."" Head down the slope and around the corner. Before long you will land on a balcony in a huge chamber with a river, and what resembles an old interior fort with a patrolling vampire, and a bluish orb glowing on the other side. Sneak down the stairs to the south and watch out for two patrolling death hounds on the ground level. Cross the narrow bridge leading west and follow the wall until an opening reveals a huge bonfire. You will likely be detected by two vampires and two of their thralls, so dispose of them and make use of Serana as she is quite strong with her ranged attacks. Head up the stairs where Malkus, the author of the note, will be busy trying to enthrall the imprisoned priest. Malkus: ""The more you fight me, the more you will suffer, mortal."" Priest: ""I will resist you, monster. I must!"" Malkus: ""How much longer can you keep this up, Moth Priest? Your mind was strong, but you're exhausted from the struggle."" Priest: ""Must... resist..."" Malkus: ""Yes, I can feel your defenses crumbling. You want it to end. You want to give in to me. Now, acknowledge me as your master!"" Priest: ""Yes. master [sic]."" Dispose of Malkus and claim the Weystone Focus from his corpse. Follow the marker up the stairs and activate the Weystone Source with the Focus you took from Malkus. The magical barrier will disappear and reveal the  Moth Priest, although not in the state you expected. Instead, he will chant: ""I serve my master's will. But my master is dead, and his enemies will pay!"" The enthralled priest will then attack with everything he has got, so fight him until he yields. He will then stutter: ""That... that wasn't me you were fighting. I could see through my eyes, but I could not control my actions. Thank you for breaking that foul vampire's hold over me."" You can now ask him several questions, but first he will introduce himself: ""I'm quite alright, thanks to you. Dexion Evicus is my name. I'm a Moth Priest of the White Gold Tower. These vampires claimed they had some purpose in store for me, but they wouldn't say what. Probably hoping to ransom me, the fools. Now tell me, whom do you represent, and what do you want with me?"" When you introduce yourself as a member of the Dawnguard, and that you need him to read an Elder Scroll, he will prove quite knowledgeable: ""You have an Elder Scroll? Remarkable! If my knowledge of history serves me, I recall that the Dawnguard was an ancient order of vampire hunters. I will be happy to assist you with your Elder Scroll. Just tell me where I need to go."" When you tell him to go to Fort Dawnguard, he will immediately be on his way and you are to report back to Isran. Before leaving, loot the chest nearby then exit the same way you came. The Elder Scroll[edit] When you return to Fort Dawnguard, you will find Dexion Evicus in the main chamber, facing Isran. Isran will confirm that Dexion has the Elder Scroll and is ready to start reading it. When you speak to the priest he will prove to be overwhelmed with joy: ""Ah, my rescuer! It's good to see you again. It's not exactly the hospitality I'm used to, but your man Isran has seen to my needs well enough. And might I add, this is a remarkable fortress. I have colleagues back home that would love to study this place in detail."" When you tell him to read the Elder Scroll he will begin: ""Among the night's children, a dread lord will rise."" Now, if everyone will please be quiet, I must concentrate. I see a vision before me, an image of a great bow. I know this weapon! It is Auriel's Bow! Now a voice whispers, saying ""Among the night's children, a dread lord will rise."" In an age of strife, when dragons return to the realm of men, darkness will mingle with light and the night and day will be as one. The voice fades and the words begin to shimmer and distort. But wait, there is more here. The secret of the bow's power is written elsewhere. I think there is more to the prophecy, recorded in other scrolls. Yes, I see them now... One contains the ancient secrets of the dragons, and the other speaks of the potency of ancient blood. My vision darkens, and I see no more. To know the complete prophecy, we must have the other two scrolls. This ends the quest and starts the next three quests, Chasing Echoes, Scroll Scouting and Seeking Disclosure."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Prophet_(Vampire)","Speak to Lord Harkon. Listen to Harkon's speech. Locate a Moth Priest. Seduce the Moth Priest. Report back to Lord Harkon.","The Speech[edit] Seek out Lord Harkon as directed by Garan Marethi at the end of the previous quest. The leader of the Volkihar is in his chambers, located east of the entrance to the Cathedral. Question him about wanting to speak with you, and he will let you in on his plan to end the sun's tyranny: ""Yes, I did. When I told you that I was grateful for my daughter's safe return, I told the truth. But I did not tell you everything."" There are two options, both of which end up at the same place. If you tell him you suspected as much, and he will respond: ""Good. Strong instincts and a cunning mind will serve you as well as blade, spell or claw."" If you instead ask when he plans to start trusting you, you'll be told: ""Do not presume to tell me who I can and cannot trust. I possess the wisdom of a dozen lifetimes, and I will make my own judgements. Now be silent, and hear what I have to say."" Lord Harkon giving his proclamation Now, he will speak of his plans, and your part in them. After the monologue, follow him to the balcony overlooking the main hall of Volkihar Keep, where he will give a speech to the other resident vampires. He will command them, and you, to find a Moth Priest, as Moth Priests are the only people able to read Elder Scrolls: ""Scions of the night! Hear my words! The prophesied time is at last upon us. Soon we will claim dominion over the sun itself, and forge a new realm of eternal darkness. Now that I have reclaimed one of my Elder Scrolls, we must find a Moth Priest to read it. I have spread false rumors about the discovery of an Elder Scroll in Skyrim to lure a Moth Priest here. Now it is time to see if those efforts have borne fruit. Go forth, and search the land for rumors of a Moth Priest within our borders. Look to the cities. Speak to innkeepers, carriage drivers, anyone who would meet a traveler. Go now, and carry out this task. This is my command!"" As Harkon said, there are two potential sources to check out: innkeepers and carriage drivers. Serana will approach you after the speech and give you another lead: the College of Winterhold. According to her, wizards always know about things people shouldn't know about. She will also request to accompany you on the trip, as she is feeling restless after being trapped underground for so long. In Pursuit of a Priest[edit] When you do as Harkon and Serana suggested and talk to the people of Skyrim, you have a few options. Carriage drivers are the easiest: all of them know immediately what you are talking about, and they are positioned outside all the major cities. You'll have to pass a Speech check to get the information for free; otherwise it will cost you. Have you seen a Moth Priest? ""That's one of them Imperial scholars, right? Old man with a gray robe? That's right. You've seen him? ""Might be that I have, but I can't say for sure. I got enough troubles on my mind just tryin' to scrape by out here."" At this point you have several options: Option Dialogue Reaction   Please, it's very important that I find him. (Persuade)  Passed: ""Now that I think on it, I did see your priest. He tried to hire me for a trip to Dragon Bridge, but I told him that ain't one of my stops."" Failed: ""Can't help you, friend. I might remember better if my pockets weren't so light.""   Passed: Obtain informationFailed: Nothing   Maybe this will put your mind at ease. (Bribe)  Passed: ""Ah yes, I remember your Moth Priest now. He wanted me to take him out to Dragon Bridge, but I told him it ain't one of my stops."" Failed: ""An' maybe it won't.""    Never mind, I'll look somewhere else.  ""Suits me just fine.""  Nothing Innkeepers are another choice; however, only Corpulus Vinius or Sorex Vinius at the Winking Skeever in Solitude and Hulda at The Bannered Mare in Whiterun have a clue, and they require a Speech check (50) or a bribe as well. Heard anything about a Moth Priest passing through? ""Have I heard anything? It was the talk of the city for three days straight. Ain't too often we get a visitor like that. Where is he now? ""Oh, he just left a short while ago. He said he'd finished up his work and it was time to move on. That's all I can tell you. He asked me not to let anyone know where he was going. I suppose he didn't want the attention."" At this point you have several options: Option Dialogue Reaction   It's important that I find him right away. (Persuade)  Passed: ""Ah, well, in that case I'll tell you what I know. He took the road southwest out of town, and said he was going to be crossing over the Dragon Bridge. That's all that he told me. I hope it helps."" Failed: ""It's like I said, I'm not going to talk about it.""   Passed: Obtain informationFailed: Nothing   Finding that Moth Priest is worth a lot to me. (Bribe)  Passed: ""I can see that. He said he was heading for Dragon Bridge next. I hope that helps you."" Failed: ""Sorry, but that Moth Priest's comings and goings are none of my business, and none of yours either.""    I'll try my luck elsewhere.  ""Never much cared for folks who can't mind their own business.""  Nothing It takes a bit of travel, but Urag gro-Shub, the librarian at the College of Winterhold will tell you there is a Moth Priest in Skyrim for free: ""The obvious answer is to go to the Imperial City. The Moth Priests make their home in the White Gold Tower. Sometimes they go out looking for Elder Scrolls. Lucky for you, there's a Moth Priest in Skyrim right now, doing just that. He stopped in to do some research in the library, then left for Dragon Bridge. If you hurry, you might catch him there."" He will always tell you this regardless of your standing at the College, though College quests like Containment and The Staff of Magnus can block this dialogue. Once you have arrived in Dragon Bridge, ask the guards or townspeople about the Moth Priest. Many of the adults in town will tell you they don't know anything but others, such as Azzada or Michel Lylvieve will direct you to a guard. Some guards may not have the dialogue option, or only respond ""A Moth Priest?"" and not say any more, while others will realize what you're talking about and tell you what you want to know: ""Ah, so that was a Moth Priest, then? He rode through town not long ago with an escort of soldiers. They didn't stop, just headed south across the Dragon Bridge."" The most reliable method is to find the only child in town, Clinton Lylvieve. He will be excited to share the information with you: ""I don't know what a Moth Priest is, but I did see an old man in a robe not long ago. He was riding in a wagon with some Imperial guards. They didn't stop to visit, though. They rode through town heading south, and went across the big bridge. It was only just a little bit ago. I bet you can catch them if you hurry up."" Head across the Dragon Bridge and make your way south along the road until you come across a wrecked carriage. Among the wreckage are a dead horse, a bloodstained corpse, a copy of the book Effects of the Elder Scrolls, and a dead vampire. Search the vampire to find a note directing you to Forebears' Holdout, a ruin up the hill to the northeast. Follow the blood spatters, and when you reach the four standing stones, the entrance is to the north. Forebears' Holdout[edit] The barrier with the Moth Priest inside Inside, you will see what appears to be a ruined underground fort inside a large natural cavern divided by a river. Past the fort, you may notice the large blue-green orb on the platform; this is your target. Head left down the stairs and across the bridge. There is a Dawnguard warrior patrolling the walls of the fort, and more enemies inside, including an armored troll. However you wish to deal with them, make your way to the interior of the fort, climb the stairs and head across the platform to the orb from before. It is actually a magical barrier, and it contains the Moth Priest, Dexion Evicus, trapped inside. If you are stealthy enough as you go up the stairs, you can overhear a conversation between a Dawnguard lieutenant and his commander: Dawnguard Lieutenant: ""Those vampires put up a hell of a fight."" Vanik: ""I just hope we weren't too late. I'm not sure what they did to this Moth Priest, but he doesn't look right."" Dawnguard Lieutenant: ""You think they turned him?"" Vanik: ""I don't know, maybe. Won't know until we get him out of there."" Dawnguard Lieutenant: ""How do we do that?"" Vanik: ""I'm working on it, now give me some silence so I can think."" Kill them, and search the corpse of Malkus, located between the barrier and the west wall, for the weystone focus. With this in hand, go up the western stairs and find the weystone source on another platform overlooking the barrier. Activating the source with the focus in your possession will drop the barrier, and Dexion will emerge, chanting, ""I serve my master's will."" His demeanor will then change: ""But my master is dead, and his enemies will pay!"" He attacks you with all his might, so fight back until he yields. While he is kneeling, use your Vampire's Seduction power on him. Activate him after this to feed on him and make him your thrall. He will be awestruck: ""By the divines! It's as if my eyes have been opened! I am blinded by the light of your majesty. I... I must obey you. What would you have of me, master?"" Order him to travel to Castle Volkihar, where you must return as well. Prophet[edit] When you arrive, your new thrall will be waiting in the main hall, along with your fellow vampires. Talk to Harkon at the far end of the hall. When you tell him what you have done, he will say, ""Yes, I see that. I trust his capture was not too difficult a task?"" You then have three options; whichever one you choose, he will then give you your next instruction: ""Well, your thrall awaits and we have given him the Elder Scroll. Command him to read it, and let us hear the words of prophecy together."" Order Dexion to read the Elder Scroll, and he will be excited: ""Ah, yes, the Elder Scroll! I admit, I'm looking forward to this."" Then he will produce the Scroll and read from it, leaving you with more questions than answers: ""I see a vision before me, an image of a great bow. I know this weapon! It is Auriel's Bow! Now a voice whispers, saying ""Among the night's children, a dread lord will rise."" In an age of strife, when dragons return to the realm of men, darkness will mingle with light and the night and day will be as one. The voice fades and the words begin to shimmer and distort. But wait, there is more here. The secret of the bow's power is written elsewhere. I think there is more to the prophecy, recorded in other scrolls. Yes, I see them now... One contains the ancient secrets of the dragons, and the other speaks of the potency of ancient blood. My vision darkens, and I see no more. To know the complete prophecy, we must have the other two scrolls."" Thus ends Prophet, and begins the next two quests, Chasing Echoes and Seeking Disclosure."

Participate in your own initiation.","The Trial of the Whelp[edit] After completing one radiant quest, your job providers, Aela the Huntress and Farkas, will point you towards Skjor when asked for more work: ""Skjor was looking for you, earlier."" When asked for a reason, their response will differ. Aela will answer: ""He didn't say, but you'd better move fast. There's probably something I could find for you to do, but best to check with him."", while Farkas will say: ""Don't know. He just said he needed to talk to you before you do anything else. I don't like making him angry, but there is some work for you if you want it."" Skjor will reveal that a scholar has discovered another fragment of the legendary battleaxe, Wuuthrad. He asks you to retrieve it and will direct you to Farkas who will serve as your Shield-Brother for the task, both helping you survive the quest and supervising you to ensure you complete the mission ""honorably"". When approached, Farkas becomes a temporary follower. If you already have a follower, they will return to your home or to their base location and await you there until you've completed the quest. If asked, Farkas will elaborate on the origins of Wuuthrad. Your destination is Dustman's Cairn, a barrow northwest of Whiterun. You can either have him follow you all the way or ask him to meet you there. Dustman's Cairn[edit] The place is crawling with draugr, so be prepared for a long trek. There is a Two-handed skill book The Battle of Sancre Tor in the first room. The second chamber contains an arcane enchanter and two thrones, with the only available path blocked by a gate. Locate the northernmost room and pull the lever, which will drop another gate and trap you inside, after which the lever will break. From the other side, Farkas says he will find a way to release you, then is unexpectedly confronted by a group of Silver Hand members, leaving you trapped to watch the scene unfold. Eyes on the Prey[edit] Farkas transforming to fight the Silver Hand The Silver Hand turns out to be there for a reason. While you watch, Farkas will transform into a werewolf and wipe out the opposition within seconds. After opening the gate, Farkas will reveal that only certain Companion members are blessed with the ability. Proceed forward through the linear cave system until you reach the entrance to the second zone, Dustman's Crypt. Farkas fighting a Frostbite Spider After continuing through the next door, you will cross the bridge where you can see the lower room you are headed towards. If you stand idle in this caged walkway, at least one archer will attack you from the room below. After crossing the bridge, you will go around a corner and be in a long down-sloped hallway. If you run ahead to attack the Silver Hand, or choose to follow Farkas, a few draugr will awaken from the crypts lining the walls and attack you from behind. Make your way through the crypt and fight all Silver Hand members and draugr. In the large chamber under the bridge, open the chest for the Dustman's Cairn Key and unlock the door to the north. A few skeevers will attack in the next tunnel. When you reach an alchemy lab, head east and fight the residing frostbite spiders, then head downstream using the small bridges and face the draugr. Follow the linear path through the catacombs and open the iron door. A Fragment and a Shout[edit] A Fire Breath word wall The chamber ahead appears quiet at first, but the many sealed alcoves and coffins should hint at what to expect. Loot the many minor containers for treasure, then follow the map marker to the altar where the Fragment of Wuuthrad rests. Approach the word wall behind the altar to learn one of the words for the Fire Breath dragon shout. Finally, pick up the fragment and prepare as numerous draugr burst out of the coffins to attack you and Farkas.  Additionally, the iron door will now be locked, preventing any strategic backtracking. After the battle, a path will open from the balcony above, so make your way to a tunnel initially inaccessible in the first zone, which will land you back near the entrance to Skyrim. The Initiation[edit] Back in Whiterun, you will find Vilkas waiting for you just outside Jorrvaskr. He will then lead you around the building where the entire group of Companions will be gathered. Guild head Kodlak Whitemane will give a short speech and welcome you to the Companions, while Farkas will swear eternal loyalty to you. You are now an official member of the Companions, but will have to complete yet another radiant quest before your next major assignment. You will also be able to buy Skyforge Steel weapons and Wolf Armor from Eorlund Gray-Mane from now on, and he will give you one Skyforge Steel weapon of your choice for free. You can also find Skyforge Steel weapons and Wolf Armor in the Merchant Chest underneath the Skyforge from here on out as well."

They will reveal that they have been pondering Kodlak's choice in the Glory of the Dead quest and want to follow suit: to be cured of lycanthropy. The Right Ingredients[edit] If you have a Glenmoril witch head in your inventory from your previous adventures in the Blood's Honor quest, the brother will urge you on to Ysgramor's Tomb. If you do not have one, the Companion is eager to procure one. Travel to Glenmoril Coven to take a head. There are five Glenmoril witches laid up in the coven. Depending on how many heads you gathered in the previous visit to the coven, harvest what you need. If you did not cure yourself of lycanthropy in the previous quest and wish to be rid of it now, harvest a head for yourself as well. However, you will need to finish the quest by curing the active follower, before you can cure yourself. The Ritual[edit] When you have one of the heads, return to Ysgramor's tomb. As you did for Kodlak in Glory of the Dead, activate the Flame of the Harbinger by tossing in the head. This will release the wolf spirit of the brother wanting to be cured. You must destroy the wolf spirit in order for him to be purged of his wolfish ways.

Upon arrival at the fort, dispose of the two Silver Hand members outside, a guard at the entrance and an archer on the roof, then head inside.

In the two-leveled room with many boxes on the floor, make sure to search for An Explorer's Guide to Skyrim which will add a few map markers for later exploration. It is located on a bookshelf beneath an elk head mounted on the wall.  The tunnel north of the room contains a locked door, so unlock it and wipe out yet another Silver Hand.

Passed: Get the keyFailed: Nothing   Let me in or I'll kill you. (Intimidate) Failed: Ha ha! That's funny. Ya' think you can take me on? Try it anytime. I've been itching for a fight. Failed: Nothing If you don't wish to kill Vald yourself, and don't want to pay the debt, you can sneak to the back of the house and shoot the ramp contraption. Vald will become hostile and chase after you. Lead him to the marketplace or any other area with guards and they will kill Vald. Loot his body and take the key. It is also possible to climb up the exterior of the Temple of Mara, by jumping onto the braziers and from there scaling the roof. From there, you can use Whirlwind Sprint to reach the balcony without ever interacting with Vald. A Plot Revealed[edit] Get a good vantage of the mechanism under the ramp and attack it using a ranged weapon (magic, bows, and shouts all work). The ramp will crash down, providing access to the second floor and the rest of the house. The first room is unguarded. The next has a single guard who should be facing the west wall, allowing you to sneak past easily. The stairs down are to the northwest. At the bottom, another guard will be patrolling. When you reach the bottom of the stairs, immediately face east and there will be closed doors. Head through them. On the northeastern corner to the barred front door you'll see a Suspicious Cabinet. Open it and then open the false back panel. Inside is a stairway down to the cellar, which leads to an underground system of tunnels. After avoiding the pressure plate by the metal gate that you see when you first enter the tunnels, make a left and head south towards a room filled with circle-shaped traps. Looking at the tiles, head south two squares, west two squares, north two squares, west two squares, and south two squares in order to avoid the traps. The hallway after the trap room has a pressure plate trap right around the corner that will launch a series of darts in front of the plate. Past this trap there is a chest on the right, which was on the other side of the metal gate at the beginning. Following the hallway, you come to a hallway filled with timed pendulum blades and battering rams. Sprinting is a useful way to get past them. Once at the other end, head down the ramp and stop at the closed door. There is a dart trap trigger on the left side of the door. On the other side of the door are, among other things, Mercer's plans, a note titled Many Thanks, a copy of the Sneak skill book The Red Kitchen Reader, and Chillrend in a case. On the desk is the Bust of the Gray Fox, which can be sold to Delvin as part of The Litany of Larceny quest. There is also a stash of jewels hidden in the bowl on Mercer's desk. Continue along the path until you reach the entrance to the Ratway Vaults. Fall down the hole (you may be attacked by some Vagrants and Lowlifes even if you had previously cleared the Ratway) and turn right to reach the Ragged Flagon. Return to Brynjolf and hand over the plans."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Put_A_Fork_In_It","Travel to Solstheim and enter The Retching Netch. Read the mysterious note and take the Fork of Horripilation. Kill the two specified bull netches using the fork and loot the artifacts from their bodies. Craft the Staff of Sheogorath using a Staff Enchanter.","Something Waiting for You[edit] The mysterious message from Sheogorath A mysterious note can be found pinned to a keg on the ground floor of The Retching Netch cornerclub in Raven Rock, along with the Fork of Horripilation. The items will be hard to miss, as they are surrounded by a green glow before you approach. The note outlines a proposed combat challenge from Sheogorath, the Daedric Prince of Madness. You are instructed to use the fork to kill two specific bull netches on Solstheim, and recover two ""familiar"" artifacts from their bodies. Specifically, you will need to recover the Branch of the Tree of Shades and Ciirta's Eye, two items which originally appeared in the Symbols of Office quest in Shivering Isles. Netch Hunt[edit] You must take the fork in order to accept Sheogorath's combat trial. Note that while the fork is literally a kitchen utensil and has very low damage, it is neither generic cutlery, which is not a weapon, nor the harder to find fork weapon, which is weapon type ""other"" - it actually has the dagger weapon type, allowing your skills and perks to interact with it normally (e.g. it will make no noise when sneak attacking), although both fork weapons do the same base damage of 1.  It also weighs 12 times as much as a normal fork, equivalent to the weight of a Daedric Dagger.  It has a special enchantment that allows you to deal damage to the Bull Netches while holding the fork, which are otherwise immune to damage. The first bull netch is located close by on the Isle of Basalt, a small volcanic island directly west of the Earth Stone. Kill the beast as instructed and claim Ciirta's Eye from its corpse. The second netch can be found due west of Skaal Village, next to an icy waterfall. It will drop the Branch of the Tree of Shades when killed. Once you have obtained both artifacts, you will need to use them to craft your true reward: the Staff of Sheogorath. Staff Crafting[edit] In addition to the two items obtained from the netches, crafting the Staff of Sheogorath will require two Heart Stones and access to a Staff Enchanter. Heart Stones are readily available on Solstheim, and can be mined from deposits all over the island. In order to use the Staff Enchanter in Tel Mithryn, the player must complete the quest Reluctant Steward for Neloth. However, any staff enchanter will do, such as the one added by the Myrwatch or Bloodchill Manor Creations. Once you have obtained the necessary crafting ingredients and access to the Staff Enchanter, you can craft the Staff of Sheogorath to complete the quest. The staff has a powerful area of effect paralysis enchantment."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ragnvald_(quest)","Find the sarcophagus. Retrieve Saerek's Skull Key. Retrieve Torsten's Skull Key. Open the sarcophagus. Kill Otar the Mad.","Two Heroes, Two Keys[edit] According to legend, the ancient ruin of Ragnvald was once populated by Nords and ruled by a fearsome chieftain named Otar. At some point, Otar went mad due to evil voices within his head and turned into a servant of the ancient dragons, causing havoc and leading to dark times in Ragnvald. Eventually, the Nords decided to stop Otar and sent in two champions, Torsten and Saerek. Although they couldn't destroy him, they managed to seal him off inside the ruin, using separate keys to ensure he never escaped from his containment. Ragnvald has long since been abandoned, but the Markarth guards are aware of the dangers lurking within, and will rightfully warn you about the place: ""There's an evil to the north, friend, and its name is Ragnvald. A tomb like so many in Skyrim, where the dead have found no peace."" Ragnvald[edit] Straight north of Salvius Farm, an unmarked path will start in the middle of nowhere, leading directly to the huge exterior area of Ragnvald. The ruin is only guarded by two draugr enemies, but the area is otherwise devoid of life and sound. Following the building on the southwest side of the entrance all the way to the back will lead to a dead bandit and a coin purse.  Enter Ragnvald Temple through the main gate and proceed through the nearly destroyed first chamber with a dead draugr on a table. Take the only available path downwards and keep an eye out for helpful potions and minor loot along the way. The path will eventually lead to a large, complex chamber guarded by three leveled draugr. Fight them and proceed in a western direction until you face an odd-looking sarcophagus in front of a set of stairs leading to a sealed area. Touch one of the empty slots and read the inscription. The quest will trigger at this point and add map markers to the two items needed, located in different zones within Ragnvald. The Two Guardians[edit] As told in the legend, the next step is to claim Saerek's Skull Key and Torsten's Skull Key from the heroes that managed to seal off Otar the Mad back in ancient times. The two guardians still protect the keys with their lives, and you will have to fight both of them to complete this quest. Check the map markers for doors leading in two different directions and choose which zone to enter first, Ragnvald Canal or Ragnvald Crypts. Guardian TorstenRagnvald CanalThe door opens to a huge water-filled room guarded by three leveled draugr enemies. Follow the stream as it bends, making sure to surface in the alcove halfway through for a boss-leveled chest behind a door, but beware of the hidden flamethrower trap activated when you touch the door; it can be deactivated by pulling the nearby handle. Proceed west and head up the bridge where a small crack in the woodworks will allow you to proceed forward. Follow the path until you reach a large open area, with Torsten's Skull Key on a pedestal. Claim the skull, which will cause Guardian Torsten to burst out of his sarcophagus, along with two leveled draugr. Finish the fight, examine the room for loot, then return to the pedestal and cross the bridge leading east. This is a shortcut back to Ragnvald Temple, although you will have to traverse a hallway full of swinging blade traps.    Guardian SaerekRagnvald CryptsHead down the wooden bridge and fight the lonely draugr guarding the first room. Two paths leads south, both of them ending in the same chamber, although the one on the left is filled with traps triggered by pressure plates. In the crypts, a total of five draugr will awaken from their slumber and attack. In the next chamber is an oil slick which can be used to damage the enemies that inhabit it. Examine the alcove for the Restoration skill book Mystery of Talara, v2 in front of the booby-trapped minor loot chest, then head up the stairs to the north. You will emerge on the level above, with free access to Saerek's Skull Key on an alcove to the east. As soon as you take it, Guardian Saerek will burst forth, accompanied by two draugr from the alcoves above. Defeat the guardians and backtrack west over the bridge, a quick shortcut back to Ragnvald Temple. Otar the Mad[edit] Otar the Mad With both Skull Keys in your possession, return to the sealed sarcophagus in the western part of Ragnvald Temple and insert them into the empty slots. The locks will then disappear, and before long, Dragon Priest Otar the Mad will emerge. Otar uses shock as his primary weapon. He tends to summon a storm atronach in the beginning of the fight, and he also uses the unique Staff of the Storm Wall with very high Shock damage. Otar will rarely follow you if you stay away from him, but he will bombard you with his staff that casts Wall of Storms. The Unrelenting Force shout is ineffective against him. He can prove to be a challenging enemy to face, especially at low levels. After the battle, it is time for your reward. From Otar's corpse, claim his valuable staff, the Dragon Priest Mask Otar with resist shock, fire and frost enchantments, along with a huge amount of gold. In the chamber behind the sarcophagus, the boss-leveled chest holds even more gold, while the word wall in the back of the chamber provides a word for the Kyne's Peace shout. When all is said and done, reclaim the two Skull Keys from the sarcophagus, as they can be sold for a high price, and exit Ragnvald the way you came."

Nothing At last, she will reveal her supplier as Sarthis Idren and his base as Riften Warehouse. She explains that the warehouse is always locked and that only the jarl has a key. The next step is to report the presence of a skooma dealer to the jarl. The current jarl in Riften will acknowledge Sarthis and his illegal operations. However, the dealer has informants in the town guard because he disappears every time they raid the warehouse. Perhaps, an outsider may be able to surprise Sarthis in the warehouse, and ""'convince' him to close down his operation"". If you accept the mission, you will be given the Riften Warehouse Key to unlock the warehouse. The Raid[edit] The warehouse is located at the southern end of Riften's docks. Orini Dral is patrolling the warehouse, and will immediately spot you. Sarthis is in the basement and will come rushing upstairs to aid his bodyguard. Orini is a modest opponent, but Sarthis can prove a difficult opponent to defeat. When they are dead, loot Sarthis' body for his key. Descend the stairs in the northeastern corner, turn around and use the key to unlock the door. On the shelves there are five bowls of moon sugar and six bottles of skooma. On the table there is another bowl of moon sugar and two bottles of skooma. Inside Sarthis' satchel there is a note with information regarding Sarthis' sources. Make sure to read the note to advance the quest. It's Not Over Yet[edit] Return to the jarl with the evidence and news of Sarthis' demise. The jarl will be grateful, saying, ""It's nice to receive good news for a change"", but will ask you to continue the crusade, which starts the next quest."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rannveig%27s_Fast_(quest)","Note: This quest does not appear in your journal. Encounter the regretful ghosts outside Rannveig's Fast. Fall into the trap of a sadistic warlock or (optional) sneak behind the warlock for an ambush attack. Claim the treasure and learn a word for the Kyne's Peace shout.","The Ghosts of Rannveig's Fast[edit] The Nordic ruin called Rannveig's Fast is located in the wilderness south and slightly to the west of Morthal, not far from the shores of River Hjaal. No road will take you there, so either follow the river or take a shortcut through Cold Rock Pass to reach the ruin. The exterior is quite large and guarded by some rather unusual Subjugated Ghosts and a single Ghost Adventurer, all of whom will apologize for attacking you. You can either choose to put them out of their misery or simply enter the ruin, as they will not follow you inside. The Setup[edit] The door opens to a huge chamber with the sky visible above and the floor overgrown with ferns. Proceed north and you will meet another subjugated ghost, who is unwilling to attack you but forced to by unknown powers. The next huge chamber has another regretful ghost wandering around. There are several paths to choose: the locked southern door leads to a small chamber with a minor loot chest, while the northern door will offer an alternate route to discover the secrets of the ruin. The most tempting option will obviously be the chiming word wall to the east, with a huge glowing chest in front. ""This is actually going to hurt a lot.""Falling DownIf you walk directly toward the word wall and the glowing chest, the darkened part of the walkway will turn out to be a cleverly hidden trap door and you will fall down to another level through another trap door until you finally land inside a locked cage. Here you find yourself surrounded by the bodies of dead bandits floating in knee-deep water. Outside the cage, Sild the Warlock will be wandering around and will be pleasantly surprised by yet another rat in the trap: ""Ooooh...yes...yes. You've fallen for my trap! Greed makes a great lure. Odd you didn't die from the fall though. Most do."" Due to your unexpected, but most welcome survival, he will start messing around the chamber, looking for something with which he can dispose of you as quickly as possible, so he can subjugate you as part of his army of ghosts. When he finally locates his desired item he will say: ""Ah...Here it is. Now, if you'd be so kind as to stand still this will be much easier for me to do. Oh, and I wasn't entirely truthful before. This is actually going to hurt a lot. You see, you have to be dead in order for the spell to take hold."" Sild will then proceed to cast Oakflesh on himself and then shower you with flames or firebolts. Without resorting to dragon shouts from inside the cage, there are three ways to get out and fight Sild face-to-face. First, you can examine the dead bandits in the water; one of them has ten lockpicks. Alternatively, search the satchel found just to the left on the cage door. It contains the key to the door. Lastly, when your health is almost down to zero, Sild will open the cage himself to finish you off.    ""This one didn't survive the fall either.""AmbushIf you manage to resist the temptation of the word wall and the glowing chest, the northern tunnel leads to a closed gate with a handle visible on the other side. Go south from the gate and up two sets of stairs until you reach a handle. The western path leads to the overhead bridges above the huge chamber and a room with another subjugated ghost and some minor loot, including a locked chest and a diamond in the hands of a dead bandit. Backtrack to the handle, pull it, and head downstairs to the iron gate, which will now be raised. Fight another ghost and take the only available path into the depths of the ruin. You will see a wooden door, but that will be your escape route so skip that for now and follow the voice coming from the western chamber, preferably using Sneak to avoid detection. Before long you will see Sild the Warlock wandering restlessly around in his chamber, waiting for yet another victim to fall for his glowing chest-trap, mumbling to himself: ""Come on! You know you want what's in that chest. Just walk toward it!"", ""Just walk toward the chest! Gravity will do the rest."" and ""I know you're up there. Go get the treasure. Doesn't it look pretty?"" If you wait long enough, an Orc bandit will take the bait and fall down in the chamber, dying immediately. A frustrated Sild will comment: ""Well...that's disappointing. This one didn't survive the fall either. No matter. Another one will be along any time now."" He will then keep wandering around the cage, hoping for more victims, but nothing else will happen. Note that Sild is hard to sneak up on, so just get as close to him as possible, then fight and kill him. The Truth About Sild[edit] After battling Sild, make sure to claim the key if you haven't picked it up already. Notice the dead body of Sild's assistant near the cage, then examine the chamber for answers. The rows of cages contain more dead bandits, a dead dog, a dead Wood Elf, and a dead Breton. Most importantly, examine the table next to the Alchemy Lab for Sild's Journal to learn the truth of Sild's sadistic activities. Lastly, unlock the boss-leveled chest for your reward, and check the table for an Unusual Gem and the Destruction skill book Horror of Castle Xyr. When all is said and done, head east and, when you reach the wooden door, open it and head south. In the last room, a door leads outside to a small ledge east of the main entrance."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rare_Gifts","All of the items can be found in multiple places in the game. For more thorough lists of locations, see the item's page.","Amulet of Arkay[edit] There is a guaranteed Amulet of Arkay at Wayward Pass at the Shrine of Arkay. You can also obtain one easily by starting The Taste of Death in Markarth. Note: Be careful when bringing the amulet back to Torbjorn Shatter-Shield. The quest marker may indicate that you should enter his house, the door of which may be unlocked, but if you enter you may be treated as a trespasser with no option to tell Torbjorn or his wife what your errand is. Meet him on the street during the day instead. Black-Briar Mead[edit] Black-Briar Mead can be found in large quantities or bought at the Black-Briar Meadery, and are guaranteed in other locations as well, most closely in Lod's House (on the table with the private letter required by Dengeir of Stuhn's quest Some Light Theft). They may also be bought from most innkeeper merchants. There is also one at the end of the cave in Unbound, right where you are told to sneak past the bear. Mammoth Tusk[edit] If you are willing to steal, you can find a mammoth tusk in several places in Whiterun: Dragonsreach Jarl's Quarters — go upstairs and into the main room then head into the room to your right; the tusk is atop the bookcases to the right of the door Jorrvaskr — on the table in the left room The Bannered Mare — located on top of a bookshelf right behind the counter; jump on the rafters from the room for rent and pluck it off the shelf If you'd prefer not to steal one and are unable or unwilling to kill a mammoth, Halted Stream Camp just north of Whiterun contains several mammoth tusks. Belethor, the general goods merchant, has a chance of stocking one if you're willing to pay for it. With Hearthfire, a free one can be found in the Main Hall of your home, if you build one. With Dragonborn, one can be found in Severin Manor, and is free to take after you take ownership. The Mirror[edit] After accepting this quest, a copy of The Mirror can be found in Windhelm's Palace of Kings. This is where your quest marker will point you, but it will count as stealing unless you are Thane of Eastmarch. Captain Aldis will accept a stolen copy. Copies may also be found on the bookshelf in the sleeping area of Broken Tower Redoubt in the Reach, or in Forsaken Cave in the Pale, over a table in the first tomb's zone. With Hendraheim, another copy can be found on the table towards right side end of the hall of the house. Night Falls on Sentinel[edit] A copy of Night Falls on Sentinel will spawn on a crate in Swindler's Den after accepting the quest. Copies may also be found in a bandit camp near The Guardian Stones, and in Volunruud during the quest Silenced Tongues. Song of the Alchemists[edit] Unfortunately, Song of the Alchemists cannot be obtained without stealing in the base game. After activating this quest, a copy spawns in the Bards College on the main floor, to the right from the entrance on the counter (a blue book). It is not marked as stolen, but you will still incur the penalties of stealing if you are caught taking it. The book can also be stolen from Anise's Cabin near Riverwood. If you have the Dragonborn expansion, a copy which does not require stealing can be found in Apocrypha, inside the Black Book called Waking Dreams, in Chapter III. A copy of the book can also be found in the hidden alchemy laboratory of Goldenhills Plantation."

(Optional) Talk with Mulush gro-Shugurz (near the smelter, during the day) and ask him about about Weylin and his room key. Find evidence about Weylin. (Optional) Talk with Eltrys in the Shrine of Talos to get your reward. Find evidence about Thonar. Find out who ""N"" is. Find evidence about Nepos. Return to the shrine.","The Attack[edit] Glory to the Forsworn! While walking through the open market in Markarth, a woman named Margret is viciously attacked while buying jewelry. Her attacker, a Breton witchblade named Weylin, will shout ""The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!"" as he attempts to escape. If you do not step in, the guards will kill Weylin, who defiantly exclaims, ""I die for my people."" In the ensuing confusion, the guards are curt as they try to quell the small crowd that has gathered. If you ask about the crime and the Forsworn, they tell you that the Forsworn are nothing but a bunch of madmen, and to mind your own business. If you search Margret's body, take the key to her room for use later in the quest, although you will be able to acquire it later on from the Silver-Blood Inn innkeeper. It is possible to save Margret from Weylin if you're fast enough. If you do save her, she rewards you with the pendant she just purchased. (Preventing the murder will affect the course of the quest; see notes below.)  The Meeting[edit] Shortly after the scene in the marketplace, a Breton citizen named Eltrys will approach you and ask if you saw what happened. You can chat with him for a bit about the assault, but then he will suddenly say, ""Oh, I think you dropped this. Some kind of note. Looks important."" If you question him about the note, he feigns innocence. The note tells you to meet him at the Shrine of Talos. You can ask him how to find the shrine, and while he is still elusive, he will say: ""Huh. Not sure. I don't worship Talos, myself. I think I heard someone mention it was underneath the Temple of Dibella, in the big crag in the center of the city."" Travel to the shrine underneath the Temple of Dibella. To get there, climb the stairs at the north corner of the marketplace, follow the bridge to the left, then take the path to the left and you should see the door. Descend into the temple and speak to Eltrys, who has been looking for answers about the Forsworn attacks that have been happening in the city, ever since his father was killed by the Forsworn and that he has been trying his whole life to find out why, and why the guards do nothing about it. He pleads for your help; find out why Weylin attacked Margret and who is behind all of this. He will pay you for any information you can bring. Margret[edit] To find information on Margret, go to the Silver-Blood Inn and ask Kleppr or Frabbi about her. She apparently rented the nicest room in the inn, which is down the hall to the left of the entrance. If you did not obtain the key to Margret's room from her corpse earlier, you can receive it through dialogue with Kleppr, steal it from behind the bar (or even just simply take it freely), or just pick the lock to her door. Searching the end table in her room will yield Margret's journal. After reading her journal, you learn that she probably wasn't just a casual jewelry shopper, and that she has been gathering information about Thonar Silver-Blood. If Margret is alive, she will be sitting by the fire at the inn or standing out in the marketplace. You can persuade her to divulge her real purpose in Markarth. Apparently, Margret is an Imperial spy working with General Tullius to investigate the Treasury House and the Silver-Blood family. She was hoping to procure the deed to Cidhna Mine for the Imperials. She is also sure that Thonar Silver-Blood arranged for her murder. After leaving the inn with your information about Margret, a Markarth City guard will try to warn you off your investigations. You can report back to Eltrys with your information about Margret for a leveled gold reward, or continue researching Weylin and Thonar before going back to Eltrys. Weylin[edit] In your investigations thus far, you have learned that Weylin worked as a smelter at Cidhna Mine and lived in the Warrens—a public house for the city's destitute. You can follow the smelter lead to the Smelter Overseer's House to speak with Mulush gro-Shugurz. However, he is reluctant to talk to you, giving you a Speech challenge, which actually results in very little information. You will find out that you need to go to the Warrens and speak with Garvey. A more direct route will be to speak with Garvey, a resident of the Warrens and the keeper of the keys. Ask him about Weylin and tell him you need the key to Weylin's room. He will only give you the key if you pass a Speech challenge to persuade, intimidate, or bribe him. Option  Dialogue  Reaction   It's important. Trust me. (Persuade) Passed: Trust is hard to come by here, but all right.Failed: No. It's not. Trust me. Passed: Continue investigationFailed: Nothing   How about now? (Bribe) Passed: Welcome to the Warrens.Failed: No, I don't think so. Passed: Continue investigationFailed: Nothing   I wasn't asking. (Intimidate) Passed: Now don't get all upset. Here. Take it.Failed: And I wasn't stuttering. No key. Passed: Continue investigationFailed: Nothing   Never mind, then. Right. Nothing If you do not receive the key, you can pick the lock on the door or pickpocket the key from Garvey. Weylin's room is to the rear of the Warrens, on the right-hand side. Enter it and look in the chest for a note addressed to Weylin. Read the note to learn that Weylin truly was not acting alone, and that some anonymous puppet-master named only ""N"" was directing Weylin's actions. You will now gain the objective ""Find out who N is"". When you exit the Warrens, a Breton named Dryston will approach you, threatening: ""You've been digging around where you don't belong. It's time you learned a lesson."" You have some dialogue options, but it will come down to Dryston taking a swing at you and a brawl ensuing. If you attack Dryston with anything but your fists (i.e., weapons or magic), you will receive a bounty and any guards that witness the fight will attack you. Once you defeat Dryston, he will tell you, ""I was sent by Nepos the Nose. The old man hands out the orders. He told me to make sure you didn't get in the way. That's all I know, I swear!"" This is all Dryston knows, and any attempts at further questions will just be answered with, ""Nepos is in charge. That's all I know."" Dryston also carries a note confirming it was Nepos that directed him to ""rough you up"". You are now directed to find out about Nepos the Nose. You can report back to Eltrys with what you have discovered about Nepos for a leveled gold reward. Eltrys will be quite surprised that Nepos may be involved, but concedes that he may be getting orders from elsewhere. From here, continue on with your investigation into Thonar. Thonar[edit] For the Forsworn! Following Eltrys' suspicions that Thonar and the Treasury House are involved in this conspiracy should be your next stop. When you enter the venerable financial institution, Rhiada will be at the front desk. You can ask to see Thonar, which prompts a Speech challenge, or you can just pick the lock on the door to the left of the front desk, bypassing Rhiada altogether. When you enter Thonar's room he doesn't seem alarmed to see you and you may speak to him about Margret, the Forsworn, or the guards that are harassing you. Suddenly, there is a disturbance—Thonar will call out to his wife, Betrid, who has fallen victim to Nana Ildene and Donnel, the supposed cleaning crew for the Treasury House. Kill Nana Ildene and Donnel, and then express your sympathies to Thonar. He will curse the Forsworn, and then tell you that he has been controlling them by imprisoning their king Madanach. Madanach has now become ""out of control"", however. The attack on Betrid can be avoided by pickpocketing Thonar's journal without speaking to him. Nepos[edit] When you enter Nepos's house, his housekeeper, Uaile, will step in to keep you from seeing Nepos. However, she is overruled by Nepos, and he invites you in for a chat. Your dialogue choices all end with Nepos admitting that he is indeed Forsworn. When questioned further he will reveal a strong loyalty to ""the King in Rags"", Madanach, from whom he gets his orders. He will give you some history on Madanach's position and political views. Nepos is actually quite verbose in the matter of Madanach, which should by now be making you suspicious. As suspected, Nepos will then inform you that Uaile is actually a Forsworn agent and you won't be getting out of the house alive. Everyone in the household draws their weapons, including Nepos. After the battle, you can find Nepos's journal where he pours out his remorse for his actions. You can also try to pickpocket Nepos's journal to gather the evidence secretly and avoid the fight. Lingering too long after the theft here will result in everyone becoming hostile. An Illusion skill book, Mystery of Talara, Part 4, is in Nepos's bedroom. Do the Time Without Doing the Crime[edit] It's off to Cidhna Mine for you. Return to the shrine of Talos to report back your findings. However, when you arrive Eltrys has been slain by a group of guards, who are now lying in wait for you. ""We warned you, but you just had to go and cause trouble. Now we have to pin all these recent murders on you. Silence witnesses. Work. Work. Work."" Player: ""What did you do to Eltrys?"" Guard: ""Same thing we do with all the other natives who want to change things around here. We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you and Eltrys started snooping around. Well, you wanted to find the man responsible for those killings? You'll have plenty of time with the King in Rags when you're in Cidhna mine [sic]."" Player: ""You're corrupt. Thonar is paying you."" Guard: ""We have a nice arrangement in this city, and we're not letting you get in the way. You have a problem with that? Take it up with Madanach. I'm sure the King in rags and his Forsworn would love to meet you. Now you're coming with us. It's a life sentence in Cidhna Mine for you."" Player: ""Madanach is behind these killings!"" Guard: ""You think you're the only one who knows that? We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you showed up. You'll have plenty of time to take it up with the King in Rags while you're serving a life sentence in Cidhna Mine."" The guards there will now attempt to arrest you. You can try to resist arrest or talk your way out of it; however, you must submit to being jailed in order to advance the quest to No One Escapes Cidhna Mine.  Otherwise... Another route: if you are already a thane before starting this quest, and you pickpocketed Nepos's journal to avoid conflict; you may be able to avoid arrest and/or infamy related to finishing the quest by the following: Go back to the shrine of Talos to meet Eltrys. Allow the main guard there to initiate the dialogue: Guard: ""We warned you... ...Work. Work. Work."" Exit the chat before responding [press B etc]. The guard will immediately re-engage you. Guard: ""You have committed crimes against the Jarl... how do you respond?"" (Or similar dialogue depending on version). Player: ""I am the thane. I demand you release me at once"", to which the guard will apologize, and give the standard response to using thaneship to avoid crimes.  You must then immediately exit the shrine of Talos. If you do not immediately exit the shrine the guard (Presumably realizing his error) tries to re-engage you once again, back down the quest related options of dialogue: jail or resist only, and will immediately attack if you try to exit the dialogue any further. Once exiting, the main guard will follow outside, but will have apparently forgotten about the whole thing once leaving the shrine; as will all of the guards around who will treat you as before the quest started /no bounty or arrest warrant. You can also re-enter the shrine of Talos with this method to loot Eltrys's body after, which will remain in place alongside the other two guards (who will have normal dialogue with you instead of trying to arrest or attack). This route will complete The Forsworn Conspiracy quest without starting No One Escapes Cidhna Mine while keeping you free from the repercussions of finishing The Forsworn Conspiracy quest line. Using this method you will not be able to start the No One Escapes Cidhna Mine quest line. Resisting Arrest[edit] If you resist arrest, several waves of guards will attack you within the shrine.  If you end this combat (either by killing all guards or otherwise), any Markarth City Guard who sees you afterward will attempt to arrest you on sight for ""murder and conspiracy against the city of Markarth"".  When you are arrested with this dialogue, you may be presented with several normally-available choices for escaping arrest (i.e. Thane status, Thieves Guild, bribery), but any choice other than going to jail or resisting arrest is rendered useless. The guards will reject any and all attempts to exonerate the Dragonborn whatever the player tells them. They will then attempt to apprehend the Dragonborn on sight. This is a gameplay script exclusive to this mission. Going to jail will still begin No One Escapes Cidhna Mine.  This arrest-on-sight status will persist permanently in Markarth until you submit to going to jail."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rebel%27s_Cairn_(quest)","Clear Red Eagle Redoubt. Climb to the top of Sundered Towers. Kill the Forsworn Leader and retrieve the sword Red Eagle's Fury. Go to Rebel's Cairn. Place Red Eagle's Fury into the holder to open the door. Kill Red Eagle. Retrieve sword that is now called Red Eagle's Bane with different stats.","This quest starts when reading the book The Legend of Red Eagle, and is found in the Miscellaneous section of your journal. The first waypoint leads to Red Eagle Redoubt, an outdoor encampment with a couple Forsworn and some minor loot. Next head into the cave Red Eagle Ascent. There's not much to speak of in here, just a handful of Forsworn, a few easily-avoided traps, and some alchemy ingredients in various places. At the end of the cave you'll exit back out into Skyrim through an exit marked Red Eagle Redoubt (not the same door through which you entered). Head up the stairs to your right and kill all of the Forsworn along the way. Note that once the stairs end there is a sizable camp to the left with a forge, an alchemy lab, an adept-locked chest, and the Alteration skill book Reality & Other Falsehoods. To the east of the camp (to the right as you reach the top of the stairs) is the large stone structure Sundered Towers. The structure is actually the personal encampment for the Forsworn Briarheart, who you find seated at a throne as you approach. Kill him in order to retrieve Red Eagle's Fury. The quest will auto-update and ask you to unlock the secret of Red Eagle's Tomb. There's a journal on the altar near the Forsworn Briarheart with details on what you have to do, as well as a nearby chest. Don't forget to grab the key off of the Forsworn Briarheart's body. Head back across the throne and up the wooden stairs to a master-locked door, which unlocks with the key you just found. Follow the path up the tower (there are no enemies nearby) and use the pullchain to lower a drawbridge you need to cross to reach your next destination. Once you cross the bridge, you can loot some items here, and go downstairs to a door. You exit the tower facing east. You can see ruins to the north, which are empty but do provide a nice view. The next destination is Rebel's Cairn, to the southeast. Rebel's Cairn is not the tower you can see in the distance to the southeast; that tower is Bleakwind Bluff, which you may want to discover if you haven't already. Rebel's Cairn is located before you reach that tower. Inside Rebel's Cairn[edit] Red Eagle's Tomb Upon entering Rebel's Cairn you will find a good amount of fungus-type alchemy ingredients (some of which you may need to use Whirlwind Sprint to access), a dead adventurer, an iron ore vein, and an altar with a weapon slot. Activate the weapon slot to insert Red Eagle's Fury, which will open the way ahead into Red Eagle's tomb and the next phase of the quest. The top of the first flight of stairs here triggers a trio of skeletons and Red Eagle himself to rise. If you are sneaking, it seems that the skeletons sometimes turn on Red Eagle himself, so it may pay to initially stay out of sight and take some pot shots at Red Eagle while he dismisses the skeletons. Take them out how you see fit, although do note that Red Eagle can raise the skeletons, so you might want to take him out first (the skeletons are actually summons; after a while they may collapse on their own). You can also head around to the far right or left behind some spiked sticks to give you some cover from Red Eagle (while still leaving you room to attack him). Once defeated, Red Eagle will drop a honed ancient Nord greatsword of burning. A chest behind Red Eagle's coffin contains some loot. Head back out to the first chamber and grab Red Eagle's Fury, which is now Red Eagle's Bane."

Ask Esbern about dragon lairs to start the repeatable quest Dragon Hunting.","Help Wanted[edit] Delphine inducting Lydia into the Blades After completing Alduin's Wall, you may notice that the Blades' mission of ridding Skyrim of dragons may be rather daunting for just two people. Ask Delphine about her apparent staffing shortage and she will reply, ""The Thalmor hunted us down, remember? It wasn't exactly great for recruitment. But we have a headquarters of a sort now. We'll rebuild the Blades. Someday."" As you are the Dragonborn, and the Blades are sworn to protect you, you might be inclined to help Delphine find new recruits. When you offer, she will say, ""If you find anyone you think would make a good recruit, I can certainly take a look at them. Remember, though, being a Blade is a lifelong commitment. Their loyalty has to be with us once they're in."" Recruiting[edit] To recruit a follower into the Blades, simply bring your new recruit to Delphine in Sky Haven Temple for introductions. Since being a Blade is binding, Delphine will ask you for confirmation: ""Are you sure? I'll need to ask them to take an oath to leave their old life behind and stay here from now on."" Confirm your selection and Delphine will agree. She will then give the oath to your first recruit: Delphine:  ""You there. The Dragonborn wishes to give you the chance to join the lost guardians of Tamriel. The dragon slayers. The Blades. Do you wish to become a Blade?""   Follower: ""I do.""   Delphine: ""Are you willing to trade away all claims and titles of your former life? To live here and devote yourself to protecting Tamriel from danger?""   Follower: ""I do.""   Delphine: ""Then by my right as acting grandmaster, I name you a Blade, with all the privileges, rights, and burdens that brings. Godspeed."" Happy Hunting[edit] You can bring two more recruits to Delphine for the oath taking. After the third, she will say ""That's enough recruits for now. Ask Esbern about the dragon lairs he's been studying. We'll have the recruits do some hunting with you."" Speak to Esbern to complete the quest and begin the Dragon Hunting repeatable quest."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Recipe_for_Disaster","Talk to Festus Krex. Find Anton Virane and make him talk. Kill Anton Virane. Find Balagog gro-Nolob and kill him. Take the invitation off of Balagog's corpse. (Optional) Hide Balagog's corpse. Return to Festus Krex.","A Pinch of Assault[edit] After dealing with Cicero, Astrid is anxious to get back on task. She mentions something about a famous, elusive chef and a crazy scheme to impersonate him while cooking for the Emperor. She then points you to Festus Krex, who will be directing this phase of the Emperor's assassination. Festus explains that your new objective is to kill the Gourmet and while assuming his identity, poison the meal being prepared for the Emperor. What complicates this matter is that the Gourmet's identity is known by only a select few. Luckily, Festus has obtained an autographed copy of the Gourmet's book Uncommon Taste owned by Anton Virane. This suggests that Virane may know the true identity of the Gourmet. Carving the Cook[edit] Your first task is to track down Anton Virane, obtain the Gourmet's name, and kill Virane to prevent his interference in the operation. He works at Markarth in the Understone Keep kitchen. He is at first not willing to give you any information, but after some special persuasion, he will quickly reveal the name of the Gourmet: an Orc named Balagog gro-Nolob. After he reveals the name it is advisable to tell Virane that he will not be harmed or to remain silent, else he will start running around in a panic. Wait for an opportunity to present itself and kill him, preferably without any pesky witnesses present who could cause you to incur a bounty.  Conversely, instead of having him remain in the crowded kitchen it may be better to scare him and have him run out to a more private place where you can kill him with no witnesses. When this is finished, it's on to the main course... Just a Dash of Blood[edit] Balagog gro-Nolob, the second assassination target for this quest The Gourmet, Balagog gro-Nolob, can be found at the Nightgate Inn, either inside or outside, depending on the time of day: during the afternoon, he stands at the dock right outside the inn and gazes out over the pond, making it very easy to sneak attack him for a quick kill. After he is dead take the writ of passage from him, and simply drag his body into the pond (see Notes below) to fulfill the bonus objective. Another way to dispose of the body is to use the Unrelenting Force shout to send it into the water.  At night, Balagog gro-Nolob can be found in the Nightgate Inn Cellar, which can be entered either from inside the inn or via a small hatch near the north exterior wall. Balagog will be asleep much of the time, but as there are no witnesses, the kill will be easy whether he is awake or not. When presented with an opportunity, kill him and take the Writ of Passage from his corpse. Make sure not to kill him in the chair that he sits in because his body may get trapped in the chair, rendering him unable to be dragged to a hiding spot. To successfully hide the body in the cellar, drag him behind the haystack or drop him into the large barrel at the end of the cellar next to the ladder. If you kill him while he cowers behind the wine barrels, this will automatically count as hiding the body. If you successfully hide the body, you will be awarded with the Nightweaver's Band. You may also have a small conversation with him: Topic  Dialogue  Reaction   ""You've served your last meal... Gourmet."" ""Gourmet? Why I... Um... Oh dear. You're going to kill me now, aren't you?"" Cowers behind the barrels of wine.   ""Soon, the Emperor will die. Murdered, by the Gourmet."" ""What? The Emperor? But I... Oh. Oh, by the gods, no. No, you can't do this. You can't!"" Cowers behind the barrels of wine.   (Remain Silent) ""Yes, well. Perhaps the proprietor of this establishment can assist you. Please, you're starting to... frighten me."" Ends conversation. No More Soup for You[edit] With the Writ of Passage in hand, return to the sanctuary for your reward. Astrid greets you with special news: All of the pieces are in place, and the time is at hand. She instructs you to head to Castle Dour in Solitude to fulfill your duties as Listener."

Return to Neloth for your reward.","The Missing Steward[edit] The eccentric founder of Tel Mithryn is master-wizard Neloth who works his few employees hard and expects them to carry out even the most unfair duties. His current steward is named Varona Nelas and is constantly challenged by the demanding wizard, who has a weak spot for tea brewed from canis root. Once you have spoken with Varona and left Tel Mithryn at least once, she will be nowhere to be found. Pay a visit to Neloth in his tower and he will wander around saying: ""Where is that ash sucking steward of mine? Varona!"" As it turns out, the wizard is quite hungry and will task you with finding Varona: ""Well find her. Tell her I want apple cabbage stew, with some canis root tea."" He will not take 'no' for an answer, regardless of which option you choose: ""Where is that ash sucking steward of mine?"" Why don't you just make your own tea? ""What? Make my own tea? I am a master wizard of the House Telvanni. Other people make tea for me."" Hey, I'm not your servant. ""Obviously not, or you would have a cup of tea in your hands. I supposed you want to be asked nicely. Very well. Please, oh hero of Skyrim. Please find Varona. I shall be ever so grateful."" Of course, Master Neloth. As you command. ""Finally. Someone who recognizes my importance around here."" Neloth will then return to his daily routine and you will have no choice but to search for the missing steward. No map marker will be provided, so look around for the other inhabitants of the settlement. Ash Spawn Attack[edit] Outside, Neloth's apprentice Talvas Fathryon will refuse to talk about Varona until you complete his quest From the Ashes. Even so, he will point you towards local apothecary Elynea Mothren for information. Alternatively, you can talk to Ulves Romoran inside Tel Mithryn Kitchen. Both he and Elynea will tell you that Varona just departed for Raven Rock in order to gather supplies. Bringing this information to Neloth will net you nothing, as he only cares if his tea is hot or not. After speaking to Elynea or Ulves, a map marker will now point you towards Varona who will most likely (see bugs) be in the area west of the Sun Stone, not far from a dead reaver. Unfortunately, she never made it to Raven Rock as she was killed by three ash spawn, all of them still gathered around her dead body. Kill the ash spawn and investigate her body for a quest update. A Popular Wizard[edit] Back in his tower, Neloth will have a hard time showing any emotion when you tell him the sad news: ""Dead? Well that's annoying. How did she die?"" When you tell him about the ash spawn attack, he will reflect a bit but will quickly get over it: ""There are more and more of those things showing up around here lately. I suppose you'll have to find me a new steward. Try Raven Rock. They are in awe of me there. I'm sure almost anyone would be willing to serve me."" Three options will be available and the two top options will always lead to the third: ""Try Raven Rock. They are in awe of me there."" You can't just order me around. ""Well, somebody needs to get me a new steward. It might as well be you. But if you don't want to help a master wizard of House Telvanni, possibly earning his favor, you're a fool."" What's in it for me?	 ""So gaining the favor of a Telvanni wizard isn't enough? I suppose I'll have to pay you. Heroes. They get greedier every century."" What kind of a person should I look for? ""Hmm. Excellent question. Once word gets out, there will be a lot of people to choose from. Someone with a brilliant mind and robust physique that is blindly obedient would be ideal. Oh, and they need to know how to brew tea. Ulves always waters it down."" Once again, you will have to obey orders, so travel to Raven Rock, where a huge amount of the citizens will have an extra dialogue option, namely to consider a position as Neloth's new steward. Unexpected Reactions[edit] When you begin asking the inhabitants of Raven Rock if they want a new job as Neloth's personal steward, it soon becomes quite clear that the wizard may have overestimated both his reputation and popularity, as shown in the table below: Name Response   Geldis Sadri ""Are you nuts? Neloth is crazy! I hear he talks to mud crabs.""   Fethis Alor ""Don't be ridiculous. Who would run this place? You should ask around at The Retching Netch. Someone there might be crazy enough, or drunk enough, to do it.""   Adril Arano ""I'm perfectly content with my current position.""   Cindiri Arano ""I could never leave Adril behind, and he will never leave Lleril. Besides, I'd never work for Neloth! I heard he cut the heart out of his former apprentice.""   Glover Mallory ""Ha ha ha! Gods, that's rich. Work for Neloth. Ha ha ha!""   Dreyla Alor ""My father needs me. He can't run his market stand alone. Besides, Neloth is as loony as a skooma addict. He wanted my father to import a white mammoth. Alive!""   Crescius Caerellius ""Nah. I don't think so. Anyway, I don't think he'd take on anyone that isn't a dunmer.""   Aphia Velothi ""Me? I hardly think so. That Telvanni wizard is unhinged. I heard he tries to drink the ash.""   Mirri Severin ""Now why would I want to work for House Telvanni? Besides, Neloth is a madman!""   Mogrul ""Ha, ha, ha! Not on your life! I'd have to be truly desperate to do that.""   Milore Ienth ""Not on your life! I'd sooner try to swim back to Windhelm.""   Rirns Llervu ""I'd saw off my own leg for a septim, but you couldn't pay me enough to do that.""   Bralsa Drel ""Would he give me skooma? I might do it for some skooma."" (see bugs)   Garyn Ienth ""And leave my farm? No thank you."" ""There's got to be more to life than sweeping and cleaning all day."" While Neloth seems to be the laughingstock in town, three citizens will prove helpful and point you towards Drovas Relvi who works as a cook at the Retching Netch. These citizens are Dreyla Alor, Geldis Sadri, and Glover Mallory (see notes). The Unhappy Cook[edit] Drovas is quite unhappy with working at the Retching Netch, as Geldis Sedri doesn't allow him to drink on the job. When presented with the idea of acting as Neloth's new steward he will therefore accept right away: ""Uh... you mean leave Raven Rock? For good? To go work for a crazed Telvanni wizard? Sure. Just let me get my things. On second thought, nevermind. I can get new stuff."" Drovas will then set off at a running pace and head towards Tel Mithryn where he will begin his life anew, now a steward for Neloth. If you speak to Drovas before he leaves the inn, he will simply say ""I'm off to take up my new position with Master Neloth."" When you tell Neloth, he will hatefully comment: ""That Drovas man? I suppose he'll do. He makes dreadful canis root tea though. But, I should be grateful. Here, take this for your efforts. Oh, and you may use my staff enchanter if you want."" He will then hand you the reward, a leveled amount of gold and a key that provides free access to his unique Staff Enchanter in the locked southern chamber. The chamber also holds his Black Book, Hidden Twilight. Lastly, you can now hear the eccentric wizard calling for his steward: ""Where is that lazy steward of mine? Varona! No, wait. She's dead. Drovas!"" You can also ask Neloth how Drovas is doing, and he will respond: ""The man makes a dreadful cup of canis root tea. However, he seems run the place well enough. Oh. Were you fishing for a compliment? A sign of gratitude? Don't waste your time. Those things are for the weak and foolish."" You can also ask Drovas how things are going, and his response will be: ""Neloth is a real task master. And the tea. The thrice damned tea! I don't think I'll ever learn to make it properly."""
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Repairing_the_Phial","Note: This quest can only be started after gaining full access to the Throat of the World during the quest of the same name. Talk to Quintus Navale about repairing the White Phial. Find the items required. Return to Quintus Navale.","One Last Attempt[edit] Nurelion on his deathbed A few days after the failed attempt to help the alchemist Nurelion realize his life's ambition (so long as you have unlocked the top of the Throat of the World by completing the similarly named quest), a courier will seek you out with a letter from Quintus Navale (Nurelion's assistant) who has grave news, and seeks your help. Head to Windhelm and locate The White Phial in the market district. In there, Nurelion will still be in his bed, coughing and slowly dying. Quintus, however, will be more than ready to explain what is needed to repair the Phial: ""I have some thoughts. There are three crucial elements. Some may be easier to find than others. On the top of the Throat of the World is a patch of Unmelting Snow. No heat can touch it. Then we need the tusk of a mammoth, ground to a fine powder as only the giants know how. The final step is tricky. It requires the briar heart from a Forsworn of the Reach. If you can bring me these materials, the Phial can again be made whole."" Gathering the Items[edit] Although he claims not to be as skilled as his master, Quintus will provide quite a bit of information on each of the items to explain why they are needed for his plan to repair the Phial: Item  Description   Mammoth Tusk Powder   ""The ivory produced by those beasts is as hard as iron. But the giants have found ways to make it yield. They're able to grind it down so fine that it can be infused into the lattice of packed snow. The finished material has the delicate nature of fresh powder snow, but the strength of the hardest steel.""   Unmelting Snow   ""On top of the Throat of the World is a patch of snow that's never melted. They say the Greybeards taught it to ignore the sun, and heat simply washes over it. The original Phial was made from this snow. We'll only need a small bit for the repairs.""   Briar Heart   ""The final tempering of the Phial was performed with a type of old magic that's been lost since the Dragon War. The nearest modern incarnation of it is the strange rituals practiced by the Forsworn. With the heart of one of their Briar Warriors, I can lock the Phial's magic into its physical form. It's difficult to explain to the layman -- forgive me if I begin waxing alchemic."" Repairing the Phial ""Master, look. It's the Phial."" The rather unremarkable patch of Unmelting Snow can be found at the Throat of The World. Mammoth Tusk Powder is in a large vat beside the giants at Stonehill Bluff, and it is possible to pick up the powder without aggravating the giants. Note that the Mammoth Tusk Powder is different from the alchemy ingredient Powdered Mammoth Tusk. A Briar Heart can be acquired from a dead Forsworn Briarheart and can be obtained from multiple Forsworn camps; one will be marked on your map. Repairing the Phial[edit] When you return to Quintus with the three items, he will be relieved: ""Thank the gods. I'll get to work on the Phial straight away."" He will then leave his spot behind the counter and get to work at the alchemy lab in the corner. Once he is finished repairing the Phial, he will head upstairs, eager to show his master what he has accomplished: Quintus: ""Master, look. It's the Phial."" Nurelion: ""What? How?"" Quintus: ""It doesn't matter. Look, it's refilling with your tonic as we speak."" Nurelion: ""Marvelous."" Nurelion will then die peacefully and Quintus will turn around and express his gratitude: ""He is gone. But thanks to you, he died knowing his life's work was not in vain."" When you say you are sorry to hear that old Nurelion is dead, he will respond: ""As am I. You acted very nobly in helping my master realize his life's work. Thank you for that. As for myself, I've always been content to simply be an alchemist. I fear keeping the Phial would just remind me of Nurelion's obsession, and how it consumed him. Here, keep it. You are as much a part of its legend now as Curalmil was. I hope it brings you the happiness that my master desired."" The Reward[edit] You have a number of options for which kind of liquid the Phial will be able to regenerate: I'd like it to have the power of healing. (restore health for 100 points) I want to resist the forces of magic. (20% resist magic for 60 seconds) I want to be tougher in battle. (+20 stamina for 300 seconds) I want to strengthen my magical skills. (+20 magicka for 300 seconds) I want to deal more damage in battle. (+50% to one-handed damage for 60 seconds) I want to be better hidden in the shadows. (20% harder to detect for 60 seconds) You will be given The White Phial, which functions as a potion of the nature you chose.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Repentance","Help Illia reach the top of Darklight Tower. Defeat Silvia on the top of Darklight Tower.","A View to a Kill[edit] The standoff While travelling southwest of Riften, you may come across the ominous Darklight Tower. The guards in Riften are concerned about the place, stating: ""There's a foul presence coming from Darklight Tower... Some say the place is home to necromancers.""   When you enter the tower, you will be witness to a murder; an Imperial elemental mage has killed a witch. Seeing you, the mage, Illia, tries to explain. Illia is near desperate, trying to escape the depravity of the coven within the tower. She was tasked with locating a human sacrifice so that her mother, Silvia, can conduct a ritual to become a hagraven. Illia takes responsibility for the horrific things she has done in the tower, but makes a stand against taking an innocent life. She asks you to help her stop her mother's vile plan. Witch Hunt[edit] Hagraven duel If you agree to help her, Illia will start ascending the stairs, but will typically wait for you to catch up. On each level of the tower you'll encounter a witch or hag and an assortment of creatures such as skeevers, frostbite spiders, or trolls. Despite being casters, witches and hags are very weak and Illia, unlike them, is a very capable frost mage.  Battling through to the third floor, you may notice a locked door requiring a key on the way up. Illia has this key, and it can be pickpocketed, however, it's probably not worth the effort to pickpocket her or kill her for this, as the room only contains a cupboard with several potions. Once the quest is over, you can take Illia's key freely if you ask her to be a follower. Stopping at a portcullis, Illia warns of a hagraven ahead. Pulling the lever will open the gate and allow you to slay the hagraven, as well as any other creatures on this level. A copy of the Illusion skill book 2920, Sun's Dawn, v2 is on the table by the hagraven's tent. Continue into Darklight Chambers, killing the witches. Here you will come to a master-locked door. Illia says that one of the hagravens carries the key. She then hopefully asks if you can pick the lock. If you decide to retrieve the key from the hagraven, Illia will wait at the door for your return. The hagraven you are looking for is in the room off the corridor to the east, accompanied by a hag.  Once you have the locked door open, Illia will resume the ascent to the top of the tower. You will meet more hags and creatures on your way up, as well as a copy of the Destruction skill book Mystery of Talara, v3 on a table on one of the landings. The Demise of Silvia[edit] A daughter's betrayal Once you reach the top, Illia explains that her mother is just on the other side of a closed door; and Illia has a plan. She's going to present you to her mother as the sacrifice and while her mother is preparing, you and Illia can kill her mother together. While a difficult decision, Illia seems resolute. She would rather her mother die at her hands than have her turn into a monster.  Open the door to an open area where Silvia has prepared the ritual. Illia will begin the charade and Silvia will ask you to sit on a chair in order for the ritual to begin. At this point you can either outright kill Silvia or trust that Illia isn't merely playing you for a fool and sit in the chair. If you do sit in the chair, Silvia will begin the ritual and Illia will make good on her promise to stop her.  Silvia is fairly tough, compared to the residents of the tower, but no match for you and Illia combined. Once Silvia's path has ended, Illia will ask for no sympathy; she plans to leave this all behind. Illia thanks you and allows you to keep her mother's Staff of Hag's Wrath as payment for your help. You can ask Illia if she would like to come with you and she seems eager at the chance to, ""do some good for a change"". She will then be your follower. Before leaving, be sure to pick up the Destruction skill book Horror of Castle Xyr, sitting atop the table next to the tent."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rescue_from_Fort_Kastav","Report to Legate Rikke at Winterhold Imperial Camp. Meet the Imperial scouts near Fort Kastav. Sneak into Fort Kastav. Free the prisoners from their cells. Clear the fort of Stormcloak soldiers. Report back to the scout team commander.","Report to Rikke[edit] Report for duty to Legate Rikke at Winterhold Imperial Camp, east of Dawnstar. She will tell you to take Fort Kastav from the Stormcloaks. As the rebels currently hold some fellow Legionnaires in the fort's prison, you are to meet up with some scouts in the area, infiltrate the prison, release the prisoners, and then use their help to take the fort from the inside. When you agree to take the mission, the quest will initiate. Rikke will mark the scouts' location on your map (southeast of your location, about halfway to Windhelm), and you will note in your journal that your objective is to ""Meet the men near Fort Kastav"". You can successfully complete the quest without first sneaking inside and freeing the prisoners, but to accomplish all of the objectives as ordered, you must meet the scouts within a certain period of time, and you must avoid being detected by the rebels holding the fort before you get inside. The route you take to get there, and what you do on the way, can influence both of these contingencies. Meet the Scouts[edit] The meeting point is on a cliff to the southwest of the fort. If your route takes you next to the fort before you reach them, you are likely to be detected by a rebel sentry. While you can successfully complete the quest in this event, you will not be able to complete all the objectives according to the plan. Accordingly, if you will fast travel to a location near the fort, you may wish to select a location to the west or southwest of the fort, such as the Nightgate Inn, Forsaken Cave, or Fort Dunstad. This will allow you to approach the meeting point without passing the fort. Detailed guide and tips: Main roads route   If you follow the Clairvoyance pathing from the camp, it will take you back into Dawnstar, then south out of town toward Fort Dunstad by the main road that lies west of town. Sometimes the pathing may not go through Dawnstar, but instead take you to the road just southwest of town. Expect a dragon attack in Dawnstar or just to its southwest.  Stone pile indicating the left turn, partially visible middle-leftTravel quite a distance on the road south from Dawnstar. Eventually, you will likely encounter a frostbite spider attack. Shortly past the site of this, watch for a pair of stone piles on your left. They may be obscured by a tree and some grass (see photo). Turn left onto the paved road that they mark. If the road takes a curve to the right and you see Fort Dunstad ahead of you, you have missed it. This road will point you due east toward Fort Fellhammer, visible a short distance ahead of you. Fort Fellhammer will likely be guarded by bandits who will detect your presence and attack as you pass—unless you successfully sneak by, sticking to the right, and following the road as it curves to the right. If you engage them, then afterwards return to the road (southwest of the fort) and proceed south. There are no significant valuables around the fort's exterior. This road will take you southwards over a low hill and then down a fairly sharp descent. Where you level out, you are likely to be pounced upon by a snowy sabre cat or other hostile animal. Ice Wraiths also inhabit the general area. Before you reach Weynon Stones, identifiable by some stone pillars just ahead, turn left (east) at a T-intersection. Although the road you will run across is generally well-maintained, the paving stones are spotty here, so you may have to look around a bit to see it. As you proceed, your compass should show the tree icon marking Shrouded Grove ahead of you. Continue onward, and as this icon flies off to the right of your compass, you will reach a major crossroads marked by a prominent signpost and known to be a favored ambush point for thieves. After dealing with any such threat, turn left (east-northeast) toward Windhelm. You will pass the Nightgate Inn, on the right side of the road, and may wish to save your game in this area. At this point, you and the scouting team (of four men) are both nearing the meeting area. The scouts may meet one or more enemies, most likely including a frost troll. If such an attack occurs, it may happen before you arrive, while you are arriving, or just after you arrive. You may have an opportunity to intervene and reduce some or all potential fatalities among the scouts, thus giving you more allies when you eventually engage in the main battle for the fort. In any event, at least their leader will remain when you arrive, and he is all that is required. If you are unhappy with the number of scouts who end up alive, you can later reload a save from here. From the Nightgate Inn, continue east on the road. After a moderate distance, passing two roads departing up to the left, you will reach an intersection with a stone pile and a signpost marking the road to Winterhold running up to the left. This is another point at which thieves may lie in wait, or you may encounter a wanderer, such as M'aiq the Liar. From the signpost, turn toward your objective marker and head eastward up the hill off-road, and eventually right off a short cliff. Here you may encounter a frost troll, ice wraith, or other hostile, possibly ahead of you and to the right. If you do find enemies here, quick action—especially paralyzing or otherwise quickly incapacitating any frost troll—may help protect the lives of the scouting party. Detailed guide and tips: ""Direct"" mountain trek route   Note that getting lost in the mountains can carry two implications for how the quest unfolds. First, if your path ends up taking you past the fort on your way to meeting the scouts (and you are seen by a Stormcloak there), the optional objective of sneaking in to release the prisoners will not appear; however, the quest can still be completed in this event: The rebels will engage you directly and the scouts will come to your assistance. Second, the scouts will not wait for you if you become delayed for too long, either because it takes you too much time to find your way, or because you are too long delayed in battles (e.g., if you near Mount Anthor, you will likely confront more than one of the powerful dragons who nest in the area). In such an event, the objective of sneaking into the prison will not appear, and you will go directly into battling for the fort whenever you finally arrive.  Head SE from Frostflow Lighthouse.You needn't get lost, however. The following route can get you to your destination quickly: From the camp, turn toward the objective marker on your compass and trek cross-country on the footpath you will find in the area. You will soon encounter a rocky mountain range extending to the right (southward). If you bear to the left of this, you will pass between Frostflow Lighthouse on your left and the rocky rise on the right. Turn south after passing the rock on the right. Once you pass over a small crest, you will see ahead of you some jagged rocks behind which lies an impassable chasm and some buildings which are part of the sprawling Dwemer ruin, Alftand. Navigate around this by passing the rocky area on your right, then turning right (south) instead of heading across the open area between you and the jagged rocks. Proceed southward for several hundred yards, ascending several rounded hills that rise in a somewhat step-like fashion, and passing Alftand Ruined Tower to your left.  Head south until you pass Alftand Ruined Tower (middle-left).You may encounter an Ice Wraith or hostile animal in this area. You will almost certainly see a dragon who nests on the mountain peak, though the dragon may or may not see you.   Your objective marker should now be pointing at a tall mountain peak to the southeast. If you approach its base and then skirt around to the right (southwest) of it, you should find yourself on a mountain path that travels through Wayward Pass. As you descend after Wayward Pass, be on the lookout for a path that turns to the left and heads uphill toward your objective marker. This is clearly a footpath, and not simply a clear area upon which you can climb up the mountain. This path will wind down and around, and then ends at a paved road which you can follow due east toward your marker. You may wish to save your game in this area. At this point, you and the scouting team (of four men) are both nearing the meeting area. The scouts may meet one or more enemies, most likely including a Frost Troll. If such an attack occurs, it may happen before you arrive, while you are arriving, or just after you arrive. You may have an opportunity to intervene and reduce some or all potential fatalities among the scouts, thus giving you more allies when you eventually engage in the main battle for the fort. In any event, at least their leader will remain when you arrive, and he is all that is required. If you are unhappy with the number of scouts who end up alive, you can reload from this point.  Remain on the paved road, heading eastward, until you approach an intersection with a stone pile and a signpost marking the road to Winterhold running up to the left. This is another point at which thieves may lie in wait, or you may encounter a wanderer, such as M'aiq the Liar. From the signpost, turn toward your objective marker and head eastward up the hill off-road, and eventually right off a short cliff. Here you may encounter a frost troll, ice wraith, or other hostile, possibly ahead of you and to the right. If you do find enemies here, quick action—especially paralyzing or otherwise quickly incapacitating any frost troll—may help protect the lives of the scouting party. Once you approach the scouts at the meeting point, you'll find Hadvar again, commanding them. The number of men under his charge can vary from three to zero, depending on how many may have been taken by the hostile creatures which infest the area. Speak to Hadvar. His plan is for you to sneak into the prison section of the fort through a grate located outside the walls. You should then find and release the prisoners, after killing the rebels guarding them. Once you release the prisoners, you are to make your way with them to the courtyard and engage the main rebel forces, at which point Hadvar and his men will also join to assist. If you tell Hadvar that you are not much for sneaking, he will say that he has faith in you, but also that if you get discovered at any point, you should run out into the courtyard and start fighting, at which point he and his scouts will come running. Hadvar will suggest waiting until nightfall before trying to sneak in. In reality, it's very easy to do this at any time. Your objective becomes to sneak into the fort through the grate. However, you can successfully complete the quest no matter how you accomplish the fundamental objectives, which are releasing the prisoners and taking over the fort by killing all the Stormcloaks (in either order). Sneak Into the Fort[edit] Stealthily enter the grate, to which your objective marker is pointing. If you are detected before entering the grate, the current objective will fail, but those of freeing the prisoners and taking the fort will become active, and you can still successfully complete the quest. Despite Rikke's and Hadvar's emphasis on sneaking into the fort. It is actually not necessary to sneak at all because there are no sentries who can see in your direction unless you stray quite far out of your way to the north while en route to the grate. Head directly east toward the grate from Hadvar's location, jumping down the cliff and proceeding toward the quest marker. While you cannot be seen, it is possible for you to be heard as you approach the fort by a guard who is stationed just inside the wall. However, you must actually make an effort to generate enough noise to be detected. If you wish to practice your stealth skills anyway, you may wish to consider these detailed strategies: Detailed strategies for sneaking in    Head toward the left parapet. Wait until evening, get into sneak mode, and remove your armor or lighten the amount you're wearing. It is safest to have any follower wait for you, but if you want to bring one, you may wish to take from them any especially heavy armor and weapons. If you do bring your follower along, at least take away any torches that they may be carrying. Followers apparently missed a lesson in stealth school, and will readily light up any torch they are carrying while sneaking at night.    Stand on the first set of steps. If you want to be extra-cautious, you can take further steps to try to remain undetected.     From the bottom of the cliff, walk to the spottily paved road. Follow that toward the fort until the pavement appears to end (it actually turns to the north [left]). From this point, walk due east—between two flattish-top rocks toward a parapet in the wall—until you reach a few wooden steps. From those, turn to follow your objective marker to the grate.  Proceed to the grate (top-left).If you open it without being seen, the current objective will clear, and your next objective becomes to free the prisoners. Free the Prisoners[edit] Open the grate. Once inside, follow Hadvar's plan by killing the guards before releasing the prisoners: The prisoners are unarmed in their cells, and therefore won't be much help if released into a battle. Once the guards are dead, upon release from their cells, the liberated prisoners will equip themselves with armor and weapons from a chest on the level above. A detailed strategy for freeing the prisoners   Having slipped in through the grate, pass through the wooden door and then proceed through the small room toward the doorway at its far side. This opens into a larger room, on the east side of which is a wooden door which may be open or closed. If you wait, one of the three Stormcloaks guarding the prisoners will walk into the room at one end of his patrol beat. If your fight with him is noisy, it may draw in a second guard from further in and below by the prison cells. Pass through the door to the east and, around the next corner. From most of the way down the stairs ahead, you may see the second guard who walks a patrol beat nearer to the prison cells. If that guard is not in sight, you can probably put an arrow in the back of the third guard, who spends most of his time sitting at a table at the very far end of the next room. He probably cannot be seen from the foot of the stairs unless you have eagle eye vision. You should be able to detect a lantern burning in the distance, however, and the guard will generally be sitting just to the right of this, laterally centered through the midpoint of the door between you. This would leave you with just one more to take care of. The chest next to the guard who was sitting at the table contains the prisoners' weapons and armor. In more recent versions of the game, these items are not visible (the chest appears empty), but the prisoners will nonetheless find their items there after they are freed. After the three guards are dead, you can either practice some lockpicking to open the cells, or take the Fort Kastav Prison Key off any of the guards or the table on the level just above the cells. Once all of the prisoners are all released, your remaining objective is to take the fort by killing the rebels in the exterior courtyard. Make sure that all four prisoners are released: The related objective should clear and you will note in your journal that retaking the fort is your next task. Retake the Fort[edit] The prisoners will equip themselves with armor and weapons and await your lead into battle. If you speak with them, however, you will have the option of ordering them to wait where they are. Lead them up and out into the courtyard and begin the attack. Hadvar and his men will join in the attack when the fighting starts. Unlike the battles at previous forts, no additional enemies will materialize during the battle, and the killed will remain where they fall for some time, giving you a chance to loot their bodies at your leisure. When all the rebels are dead, report back to Hadvar. Report Back to Hadvar[edit] Hadvar will inform you that he will remain to garrison the fort while you go to report the success. He will also lament that none of the prisoners you freed survived the battle if none of them survived. The quest will complete. If you have the underlying Reunification of Skyrim quest active, you will be directed to report back to General Tullius at Castle Dour in Solitude. On speaking to him, the general will elevate you to the elite rank of Legate, and bestow upon you a piece of armor with the promotion. The quality of the armor may be underwhelming, especially if you are at a higher level although you can receive Dragonplate armor."

He has sent scouts ahead to the fort, so meet up with them for further instructions. When you meet up with the scouts speak with Ralof, who will be quite happy to see you. He will tell you that they have located a cave under the lake that should lead into the fort's prison. He will ask you to sneak in, kill any Imperials you find, and then release the Stormcloak prisoners.  After you have released the prisoners, head to the courtyard where he and his men will join you in fighting the Imperials. Follow the quest marker around the fort to the lake. Be careful not to get spotted by any Imperials or you will fail that objective and have to storm the fort. Once in the lake, swim down and you will see a small wrecked boat with a locked chest slightly hidden under it. Directly behind you is the entrance to the cave. Rescue the Prisoners[edit] The passage at the bottom of the lake will lead into the prison level of the fort, through the natural cave at the southeastern corner. Eliminate the Imperial soldiers in the prison room and get a Fort Neugrad prison key from them (there should also be one lying on top of a chest in the same room). Open the cells and the Stormcloak soldiers will run to a chest to acquire weapons and armor. Talk to one of them and he will ask you what to do: you can tell them to wait where they are, or follow you. To guarantee they all survive, you may instruct them to stay behind, and return to them after the fort has been taken over. If you tell them to follow you, they will participate in the upcoming battle and may die, although this doesn't seem to have an impact on the quest. Take Over the Fort[edit] As you leave the Fort Prison level and reach the courtyard, you will engage more Imperial Soldiers. Ralof's band will join the fray once you start the fight. After the fight, you will have to go inside the fort to eliminate the rest of the garrison. You can have Ralof follow you, or tell him to wait out in the yard. Once the Imperials and the fort commander are dead, talk to Ralof and he says that he will stay and clean up the mess. That ends the quest and starts the next stage in Liberation of Skyrim."

Ask her if you can learn anything more about Restoration magic. She will tell you to go speak with the Augur of Dunlain down in The Midden. Pass the test[edit] The Augur of Dunlain will give you a test. Once you have stepped into the ""light"", all non-quest items will be taken from your possession. The Augur will summon one ghost, shortly followed by another, and finally a third; each will attack you with destruction spells and/or weapons.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Restoring_Order","Discover the location of the conjurer's lair. Investigate the Solitude sewers. Explore the root cave. Defeat Thoron. Retrieve the Sword of Jyggalag.","While completing the quest Balance of Power, you will learn that the Saints and Seducers are being funded by a conjurer named Thoron. While one journal will mention he is insane and living in the sewers, the other will mention he's located in Solitude. Both journals indicate that Thoron is looking for trinkets and junk, although his motives are a mystery to both bandit leaders. After entering Solitude, the map marker will direct you to a manhole cover leading down into the sewers. Straight ahead is a grate, and left is a barred door, so turn right and head down. Across the water you'll see that the tunnel is overgrown with strange-looking plant life. Enter this ""root cave"" and you'll notice pods that you can harvest for new types of flora. To the right is a dead end with a hollowed stump filled with random loot. Turning left will lead you into a tunnel system populated by Elytra and Spriggans. Further into the tunnel you'll reach an intersection. The right path leads to a small cave chamber populated by Spriggans, along with a dead end containing a dead hunter and goat. Continuing along the root path, you'll see a chamber ahead where some of the Solitude stonework is visible. Kill the Elytra Nymphs in the chamber, and to the left you'll see a chamber with water. From the water, you can either turn right to head up a ramp into further root tunnels, or you can go through a broken sewer wall to re-enter the sewers. If you follow the sewer path, you'll come to a room with a Spriggan and some elytra, as well as a locked chest (in an alcove behind the debris). Following the root tunnel will take you up and around, coming to an intersection where a fight apparently took place. Scattered around the intersection, you'll find both Golden and Dark armor/weapons... but no bodies. There is a short path to the right, but it's just a dead end with some enemies and a hollow stump. Continuing straight from the battle site, you'll come upon the object of your quest - Thoron, the mysterious benefactor of the Saints & Seducers gangs. The obviously insane conjurer appears to be performing a ritual, opening a doorway of some sort. Once you're close enough, the objective will update - you must defeat Thoron and stop his ritual. Thoron can be a handful - he will summon both Golden Saints & Dark Seducers, in addition to the usual atronachs. Once you've finished him off, make sure to loot his body for a unique Madness Helm as well as several spell tomes teaching you how to summon Saints or Seducers. From the 4-way intersection where you encountered Thoron, only the southern path leads anywhere (back to the beginning sewers). The northern alcove is Thoron's workstation, where you can find an arcane enchanter and numerous other items of interest. Make sure to loot it all, as both the note and the Sheogorath-Shaped Amber are needed for other quests. The notes begin the Amber and Madness Smithing quest, while the Sheogorath-Shaped Amber is needed for Staada's Quest. In the western alcove, grab the Sword of Jyggalag from the roots in order to complete the quest."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Retaking_Thirsk","Speak to Bujold the Unworthy in Bujold's Retreat. Join the assault on Thirsk Mead Hall and defeat the rieklings. Meet her at Hrothmund's Barrow. Listen to her interaction with Hrothmund's spirit. Keep her secret, kill her, or betray her to Kuvar.","Exiled Warriors[edit] Thirsk, the legendary mead hall founded in the Third Era by Hrothmund the Red of the Skaal, was built for Nord warriors who wanted to live, hunt, and fight in the wilderness, the old way. When you visit Thirsk Mead Hall, it is clear that the mead hall has seen better days, as it is currently inhabited by rieklings, without a single proud Nord in sight. Head east from the Hall and locate Bujold's Retreat, where you will find the former Nord inhabitants, clearly exiled from their own Hall and quite frustrated and embarrassed. As you enter the camp, you will witness a heated discussion between Bujold and Kuvar: ""We'll act when I say we do and not before."" Bujold: ""It won't be that easy to get rid of the Rieklings, Kuvar."" Kuvar: ""I never said it would be. But either way, we have to try. Whether we succeed or not, it'll stir up some of the old blood in this crowd."" Bujold: ""I'm not going to lead them to their deaths if they aren't ready."" Kuvar: ""Then train them. What are we doing here? We should either get used to staying here, or be preparing to retake the hall. You're having us do neither, and I can't stomach it."" Bujold: ""Your stomach isn't my problem. We'll act when I say we do and not before."" Kuvar: ""Well, you'd better say something. And soon."" Talking to the other residents reveals that everyone is unhappy about living in the remote camp, instead of the cozy warmth they are used to in the Hall. If you seek out Kuvar, he will explain it: ""We brought ourselves out here, along with our shame. We used to be proud warriors of Thirsk Mead Hall. There, up on the hill. But we let that sweet life get the better of us. We grew soft, and..."" He then tells you what happened: ""Rieklings. Those filthy vermin... they came in numbers. Waves of the things. One at a time, they're pests, but with this many... And so here we are, out of our home."" The Unworthy[edit] Locate the leader with the unflattering byname, Bujold the Unworthy, and ask her what is going on. Like Kuvar, she will be painfully honest: ""What's going on here is that we've been kicked out of our home."" She then proceeds to explain that rieklings took over the Hall and will explain how the mighty warriors lost the battle against the small vermin: ""With tenacity and numbers. Didn't help that we'd grown a little too comfortable up there. Too much mead. Too many stories. Too few battles."" While it is clear that the Nords drank themselves out of their home, ask her if she needs any help and she will gladly accept and reason that ""Some new blood should be enough to rouse these layabouts to actually fight again."" At this point, consider completing a favor quest for camp inhabitant Elmus (it becomes unavailable once this quest is started) - and consider if you want to help the Nords or not, as you will miss out on the quest The Chief of Thirsk Hall. Retaking Thirsk[edit] As soon as you agree to help the Nords, the quest will initiate and Bujold will gather her warriors with the words: ""Hey, you lazy milk-drinkers, get over here! I know you're all starting to settle in here, and keep up the fat lives you got used to up in the hall. But look here. This outsider has more fire than any of you. All I had to do was mention our little infestation, and he/she volunteered in a second! I don't want to have my spirit outstripped by some wanderer. So let's get up there and kill us some Rieklings!"" After the speech, all the warriors will draw weapons and set off at a running pace towards Thirsk Mead Hall, determined to reclaim it and wipe out the rieklings. You will have no choice but to tag along and fight a total of nineteen angry rieklings defending their new property. A total of six rieklings will defend the exterior while the rest will be inside, doing everything they can to protect their property, including the riekling chief himself. The chief can only be wounded by the Nords to the point where he drops into the recovery position; it falls to you to finish him off. When all is said and done and dead rieklings lie everywhere in the Hall, locate Bujold who will be exhilarated by the battle and ask how you feel. Regardless of your answer, she will ask you to be her 'second' for a journey, as she needs to get another blessing from Hrothmund the Red before the Nords again take up residence in the Hall. Hrothmund's Barrow[edit] Bujold will lead you to a Nordic ruin called Hrothmund's Barrow, southwest of Benkongerike. Near the entrance she will turn around and ask you whether you are ready or not. You can then ask her what this place is and she will explain the full background: ""The burial place of Hrothmund, who founded Thirsk. He brought a group of true warriors away from the soft life of the Skaal, to know the wilderness, to feel the sting of cold and of steel. I know that... sounds a little silly. It's just the way it's written in the books, and that phrase has always stuck with me."" She will also explain what will happen in the barrow: ""It's pretty simple. Hrothmund's axe is in there with him. Anyone who attempts to take hold of it has their spirit judged by Hrothmund himself."" She will then reveal that she is quite confident that she will receive Hrothmund's blessing once again. After all, she received it before. The Spirit of Hrothmund[edit] Inside the barrow, head through the first empty chamber and enter a huge water-filled room. As you approach, the water will disappear, and the now-visible path will lead you right to Hrothmund's Axe, where Bujold will try and grab it, as per tradition. When she does, Hrothmund's spirit will speak: ""Then... the leadership is not mine?"" Hrothmund: ""You seek my blessing for the leadership of Thirsk Hall?"" Bujold: ""I do. It is I, Bujold. You blessed me in the past, and now I've rid the hall of Rieklings and returned it to its rightful owners."" Hrothmund: ""And well it is that this has happened. But I have always watched, and know that it was your softness that lead to your own exile."" Bujold: ""No! I..."" Hrothmund: ""You allowed your fellow warriors to grow weak while the dangers around you mounted."" Bujold: ""Then... the leadership is not mine?"" Hrothmund: ""No. Nor is there any among you fit to serve. For a band in the wilderness, it is better to have no leader than a poor one."" After her conversation with Hrothmund, an embarrassed Bujold will approach you and two options will be available, although both will lead to Bujold making the decision to return to Thirsk Mead Hall and continue her leadership as if Hrothmund had given his blessing. She will explain why: ""No matter what Hrothmund says, we need a leader. And I'm still the best person for that."" When you point out that she goes against Hrothmund's wishes she will continue: ""Look what's happened to us so far under his watchful eye. He gave his blessing to all the leaders who brought us to this point. Anyway, he's dead and we're alive. It's time to begin a new tradition for Thirsk. And I'm going to do that. All I need is for you to back me up. You don't even need to lie... just don't tell anyone else what you heard here.""  Your next decision will make a huge difference for Bujold and maybe even cost you a few useful relationships within Thirsk Mead Hall. With Bujold determined to keep leading the mead hall regardless of Hrothmund's wishes, you must decide whether to intervene and end her leadership. After she tells you her plan, you will have two options:  NOTE: The quest will end right after you make the decision, and no reward will be given, so think carefully what benefits you the most: your relationship with Kuvar or the old Nord traditions of Hrothmund. ""Get out of here. Run to the wilds.""Follow BujoldIf you choose to accept Bujold's scheme, she will simply end the quest and walk away with the words: ""Good. See that you do. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a hall to lead."" When you return to Thirsk Mead Hall, Bujold will wander around carrying a new name, specifically Bujold the Intrepid. As soon as you enter, Kuvar will approach you and say: ""Bujold says you served well. Before we were married, I was her second on the first trip to the barrow. Hrothmund knows strength, in this world and the next."" You can either tell him the truth, that she was rejected by Hrothmund, or lie, saying that it was an honor to accompany her. Think twice before choosing, because Kuvar is a master trainer in Heavy Armor: TRUTH: ""I don't think you know how dangerous it is to say what you've just said. This is a serious accusation. I'm sure Bujold can straighten it out for us.."" He will then seek out Bujold and demand to hear the truth. Bujold will be taken by surprise by your betrayal and will admit everything, much to the regret of her husband. The argument ends with a heartbroken Kuvar asking Bujold to leave Thirsk and run to the wilds. Trying to talk to Kuvar further will reveal that he now holds a grudge towards you for separating him from his wife, meaning that he will no longer offer training. LIE: ""Yes, I remember how I felt being there with her the first time, before we were wed. I hope to see you more around the hall, friend."" He will then continue his daily routine and will offer training.     Bujold attacksFollow HrothmundIf you choose to follow ancient Nord tradition and say: ""I can't let you lead Thirsk."", Bujold will be quite sad when she says: ""I was afraid you might say that. Well, looks as though I'll have to prove my mettle against you now."" She will then draw her war axe and proceed to attack in order to keep her secret. Once she is dead, the quest will finish and Thirsk will be left without a leader. A return to the now cleaned-up mead hall will net you a concerned Kuvar who demands to know what happened to his wife: ""How did things go out there? Where is Bujold?"" You can then choose to tell the truth, that she was rejected, or lie and tell him you don't know what happened to her. Think twice before choosing, because he is a master trainer in Heavy Armor: TRUTH: ""Are you being serious? How... how did she take it?"" When you tell him she attacked you, he will respond: ""Ah. I see. I hope she... fought well. Was it... did Hrothmund recognize anyone else? Was it you? Is that why..."" When you tell him that Hrothmund said the next leader is a long way off, he will accept this, although he will refuse to speak to you again: ""Well, then. I'll do my best to keep the hall together until that day comes. Now, look... I understand you were just defending yourself. And because you helped us retake the hall, I'll look past it this once. But I wouldn't show my face in here again, if I were you. Do we understand each other?"" Trying to talk to Kuvar further will reveal that he now holds a grudge towards you for separating him from his wife, meaning that he will no longer offer training. LIE: ""Well, let's hope she makes it back soon. This lot doesn't have much patience with me."" He will then continue his daily routine and will offer training."

Return the amulet to Greta.","A Concerned Child[edit] When first entering Solitude, you will witness the execution of Roggvir, the guard that allowed Ulfric Stormcloak to escape Solitude after murdering High King Torygg. During this, a child named Svari is being sent home by her father to spare her from seeing her uncle's execution. Svari can always be found in the streets of Solitude between 10am and 8pm when she plays with the other children. Approach her and she will appear quite sad about recent events, specifically with her uncle. When you tell her you are sorry about what happened with Roggvir, she will respond: ""Thanks. Papa talks about it some. Mum doesn't say much since Uncle Roggvir died. She doesn't even go to Temple anymore. I wish she would. At least that way she'd have people to talk to."" When you offer to talk to her mother, Svari will encourage you to do it right away and the quest will initiate. The Grieving Sister[edit] Svari's mother Greta can usually be found in the family house across the street from the Bards College or browsing the market between 3pm and 6pm. Approaching her will reveal that she is both bitter and sad about the execution of her brother. When confronted with Svari's concerns, she will respond: ""She did, did she? She's going to get a sit down later."" When you tell her that Svari just wants to see her mother return to the temple, she will explain her Nord beliefs: ""Well. I wish it were that simple. Maybe it is. Look, I want to go back but I won't feel right in there without a tie to Talos. My brother Roggvir wore a symbol of Talos. He kept it hidden on his person. If I had that... I can't go near his body. Would you get it back for me?"" Agree to help her and the quest will update and a map marker will point you towards the body of Roggvir. Return to Grace[edit] If you started the quest within three days after entering Solitude, Roggvir's headless body will still lie behind the chopping block where he met his demise. If not, his body will be inside the Solitude Catacombs behind the Hall of the Dead. Enter the catacombs and fight the skeleton then locate Roggvir's coffin near the entrance. Pry it open and claim the Amulet of Talos then exit the catacombs. Locate Greta who will cheer up a bit when you hand her the amulet: ""Thanks so much. I'll return to temple. Here's something for your time and effort."" She will then hand you a reward and the quest will end.

Take these samples to Sinderion's colleague Avrusa Sarethi so that Sinderion's research may continue.","Seemingly unreachable Crimson Nirnroot, which can be harvested with a Whirlwind Sprint. The ""Noisy Red Weed""[edit] Sinderion had been obsessed with Crimson Nirnroot since purchasing a plant from a passing adventurer wanting to get something for the ""noisy red weed"" he found. Sinderion compensated the man, and then left Skingrad to set up a laboratory in Blackreach, the only known habitat of Crimson Nirnroot. Continue the Research[edit] The quest begins upon the collection of a sample crimson nirnroot in Blackreach. Your journal will update to reflect your part in finding out the significance of this plant. In order to get started, begin at the beginning in Sinderion's Field Laboratory. The research facility is located in Blackreach, right across from the gates of Alftand Cathedral. Inside you will find Sinderion's remains still clutching his field journal. After reading the journal, the quest will update requesting that you collect thirty Crimson Nirnroot samples from Blackreach - a difficult but rewarding task. Locating the Samples[edit] There are forty-four samples of Crimson Nirnroot within Blackreach (including some inside Blackreach's buildings).  Unlike the more common garden variety Nirnroot, the Crimson Nirnroot does not solely grow near bodies of water. Many plants are found near patches of mushrooms, Dwemer pipes or along the sides of the cavern. Since there are forty-four plants, all required samples can be collected at one time if you thoroughly explore Blackreach (see the Crimson Nirnroot article for more details on plant locations).  Alternatively, if you are having a hard time finding enough plants, they will respawn. Leaving Blackreach for ten days allows you to collect another sample from any previously-harvested plants. A Job Well Done[edit] After collecting the required number of plants, the quest will update again and you will be asked to deliver them to Avrusa Sarethi, Sinderion's former colleague. She is currently residing at Sarethi Farm, between Riften and  Ivarstead. Give Avrusa the thirty Crimson Nirnroot samples to complete the quest and receive The Nirnroot Missive. You will also be provided with Sinderion's Serendipity, an ability which provides a 25% chance to mix two potions instead of one."

Regain Hjaalmarch. Regain Falkreath. Regain The Reach. Regain Eastmarch.","Quest Options[edit] This quest governs the overall progress of the Civil War for the Imperial Legion. It serves as an ""umbrella quest"", taking you through a series of individual quests that you receive as it progresses. The overall goal of the quest is to conquer for the Empire, each hold of Skyrim that is currently under Stormcloak control. You will accomplish this one hold at a time, by taking control of the military fort in each.  The holds to be conquered can be altered by negotiations during Season Unending, if you do it before this quest, and therefore there are many possible ways to complete this quest. Without doing Season Unending, only the Stormcloak-controlled holds in the following table need to be conquered. The Imperial-controlled holds only need to be conquered if given to the Stormcloaks during Season Unending. The Stormcloak-controlled holds will not need to be conquered if taken from the Stormcloaks during Season Unending.

The Battle for Fort Amol Battle for Windhelm ^1These holds can change sides during Season Unending. One final complication is that when you complete the quest Dragonslayer during the Main Quest, any hold (other than Eastmarch) that you have previously been tasked with liberating is immediately transferred to Imperial control.  All remaining quests for that hold are skipped, and you need to return to Solitude to receive the next assignment from Tullius. The Pale[edit] The Pale does not need to be regained if it was given to the Imperials during Season Unending After defending Whiterun from the Stormcloaks, talk to General Tullius. He will promote you to Quaestor and order you to meet Legate Rikke at the Pale Imperial Camp. Speak to Rikke there using the ""Reporting for duty"" dialogue option. This will launch the quest A False Front. Complete that quest and then return to Legate Rikke, who will commend you and pay you leveled gold. Report for duty again and she will order you to join a group of soldiers who are staging to take Fort Dunstad from the Stormcloaks. This initiates The Battle for Fort Dunstad quest. The Rift[edit] The Rift does not need to be regained if it was given to the Imperials during Season Unending After completing The Battle for Fort Dunstad, your journal will tell you to report to General Tullius. When you speak with him at Castle Dour in Solitude, he will commend you then promote you to Praefect. He'll give you orders telling you that you're needed in the Rift. Report to Rikke at the Rift Imperial Camp who will tell you that the steward of Riften is corrupt and secretly in league with the Thieves Guild, something that can be used to blackmail her into giving information that will aid to the Legion. This will begin the Compelling Tribute quest. After completing that quest, return to Rikke who will commend you and reward you with leveled gold. Then report in to her and she will tell you to take Fort Greenwall after meeting the men outside, which triggers the quest The Battle for Fort Greenwall. Winterhold[edit] Winterhold does not need to be regained if it was given to the Imperials during Season Unending After completing The Battle for Fort Greenwall, your journal will tell you to report to General Tullius. Do so and he will commend you and promote you to Tribune (he may not mention the promotion, but he will give it). He'll then order you to report to the Winterhold Imperial Camp. At the camp, Rikke will tell you that there are Imperial Legionnaires imprisoned at Fort Kastav and that she wants to turn that into an advantage. This will trigger the quest Rescue from Fort Kastav. The Reach[edit] The Reach only needs to be regained if it was given to the Stormcloaks during Season Unending After the Rescue from Fort Kastav, your journal will tell you to report to General Tullius (again). Return to Solitude and talk to him. He will promote you to the upper echelons of the Imperial Legion as a Legate and leveled armor as a symbol of your new rank. He wants you to report to Legate Rikke (again) at the Reach Imperial Camp this time. Get there and she'll tell you to take Fort Sungard this time, triggering The Battle for Fort Sungard. Eastmarch[edit] Report to General Tullius. He will tell you that the Legion will take Windhelm soon, and to report to Legate Rikke at the Eastmarch Imperial Camp. Report for duty to her there, and she'll tell you to take Fort Amol to use as a staging point to attack Windhelm, triggering The Battle for Fort Amol. After completing The Battle for Fort Amol, return to Rikke who will tell you ""We're taking the city. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!"" This will start Battle for Windhelm. After the Battle for Windhelm, General Tullius will have a short dialogue with Ulfric Stormcloak, who will request that the Dragonborn be the one to kill him as it will ""make for a better song."" General Tullius won't care whether you kill Ulfric or not, just as long as he's dead. If you choose to kill Ulfric, General Tullius will tell you to use his sword (which is a leveled sword) to do the deed. If you choose to allow Tullius to do it, the General will reward you with a leveled sword anyway. After rewarding you, the General will rush with Rikke outside to give a speech to the troops promising increased pay and freedom for them to return to their families while giving compensation to families who have lost loved ones. This will end the quest and you're allowed to talk to Legate Rikke and General Tullius on what will happen next."

Activate the Oculory. Learn the location of the Staff of Magnus. Report to Savos Aren at the College of Winterhold.","The Synod and the Staff[edit] From the events of Good Intentions, you have learned from both the Augur of Dunlain and Savos Aren that the Staff of Magnus is a necessary part of averting the prophesied disaster. After speaking with Savos, ask Mirabelle what she knows about the Staff of Magnus and its whereabouts. She is a bit skeptical at first, but does mention that the members of a mystical group, the Synod, recently questioned her about it. While she did tell the mages that the College did not have the Staff she remembers the group talking about the Dwemer ruin Mzulft. She speculates that the Synod group may be traveling there to locate the Staff. Your Journey to Mzulft Begins[edit] Mirabelle will mark Mzulft's location on your map: southeast of Windhelm. You may reach it by traveling on the road south from Windhelm Stables toward Riften. As you enter Mzulft's interior, you will find a Synod researcher, Gavros Plinius, uttering his final words, ""Crystal... gone.... Find...Paratus...in Oculory..."" Search Gavros to find a research log which indicates he was sent here by the Synod Council with a ""focusing crystal"" needed to pursue some mysterious effort, and that the crystal needs to get to the Oculory right away. Take the Mzulft key from his corpse to unlock the adjacent door. This man Paratus seems to be an important part of this puzzle, so travel through the extensive ruin to a curious device called the Oculory. Mzulft contains a wealth of Dwemer items and multitudes of the hostile creatures and machines that typically populate Dwemer ruins. A detailed guide to the Oculory is in the table below. Getting to the Oculory    A Chaurus Reaper squashed by boulders Steam piston trap, floor pressure platesProceed through the door into a room containing a number of Dwemer metallic items. Ascend a ramp at the far end of the room. Around the corner, a pressure plate on the floor activates a ceiling spike trap. Beyond this, the body of another Synod researcher lies on the floor. At the entrance to the next large room, you will encounter two Dwarven spider workers. Two more spiders will attack in the room at the top of the next ramp. Two doors open from this room. The door to the north is guarded by a floor spike trap and contains some minor loot and a moonstone ore vein. The other door takes you up a ramp and into a room where a Dwarven spider will spring from its port at the far end. From here, continue into an area illuminated by natural light. If you turn left next to the exit, jump over the rocks next to the tree, and go to the corner, you'll find a Dwarven shield. A leveled chaurus feasts on another researcher near the far end of the first cavern. The tunnel leading out has a tripwire that activates a falling boulders trap, and two more chaurus (one of them leveled) are scuttling about. At the top of the next ramp around the corner a Dwarven sphere will drop from a port just outside a locked gate. After battling the sphere, move up another ramp and through another door. Beyond this awaits another spider, and beyond that another sphere at the end of the hall. As you move further into the ruin you come to a room with stairs leading down to a pit, a corridor leading north, and a spider. In the next room, a sphere will meet you on the far side of a narrow ledge rigged with a steam piston traps and pressure plates which will only push you off into the pit below if activated. The door that leads to Mzulft Boilery is up a ramp to the east. A strong leveled Falmer roams the area at the top of the ramp beyond. You will also find another dead researcher before heading up the next ramp. At the top of the ramp, fight another leveled Falmer, and then two more in the room through an open doorway to the north. A gate to the north opens into an empty room. The way forward is through the smaller connected room to the east.   A Falmer chestHeading east will bring you to an area consisting of natural caverns. When you enter a fairly lengthy tunnel, prepare to meet a leveled chaurus. Exit the tunnel through a narrow opening to your left. You will then see to your right the opening to a cavern illuminated with a slightly bluish light. If you wait and watch, you may see the occupants of this cavern walking around: a leveled Falmer attended by a chaurus. A claw trap which swings out from the left wall and is activated by a tripwire is behind a Falmer hut. A second chaurus will probably activate the tripwire on its way to meet you. Continue through the cavern as the path twists and turns. Ahead, there is another dead Synod researcher, and if they hear you, you might encounter two more Falmer here, one of which will be the highest-level variant you can encounter at your level, and the second will likely be nearly as strong. Your next left leads into a cavern containing another Falmer hut, and another dead Synod researcher near the doorway. The tunnel out is along the north wall, but be prepared to meet another chaurus in the next room. Further on, you will face a high-leveled Falmer in a room with a master-locked door leading to a chest and a copy of the Alteration skill book The Lunar Lorkhan. On the table is a key that will open an expert-locked door just ahead. Continue west until you come to a large rectangular hall divided by a shallow pool. On the far side of the pool await two leveled Falmer. Another researcher lies just before the door in the northeast corner leading to Mzluft Aedrome. After a lengthy and adventurous journey, go through the door to the third interior area, Mzulft Aedrome. Ascend the ramp and near the top you will find a leveled Falmer and a chaurus. Continue toward a large, multi-leveled room that can be accessed through either of two open doorways. Inside prowl four leveled Falmer, including one of the strongest variant you will find at your level, and one that will be carrying the focusing crystal mentioned in Gavros's research log. You need to obtain the crystal to complete the quest. Mzulft Observatory[edit] Your objective marker will point westward from here, but you should first obtain a key that you will need. To do this, leave the room through the doorway to the east and descend the ramp, then open the door at the bottom. Cross the next room and open another door leading eastward. Proceed until you reach a room containing two dead Falmer. Beyond the next door to the east waits a Dwarven automaton. It can be a Dwarven Centurion of the strongest type you can confront at your level. A Centurion on the other side will not be able to fit through the door to attack you up close, whether the machine breaks open the door or you open the door first. Keeping a distance makes it easy to dodge its steam attacks and pick at the machine with your own ranged attacks. After destroying it, obtain the Mzulft Observatory key from the chest on the east side of the room. Retrace your steps westward, back into the large room where you battled the four Falmer. Climb the stairs to the west and open the door there with the Observatory key. Beyond this, there is another locked door which you cannot open. When you try to do so, however, you will hear a voice from the other side, and the door will be opened by Paratus Decimius, a Synod member who is expecting Gavros, the dying man you met upon entering the ruin. Paratus will be suspicious of you; but whatever the course of your conversation, when he finds out that you have the focusing crystal, he will agree to work together with you and ask you to follow him. You will note in your quest journal that you have reached the Oculory and that your plan now is to follow Paratus to investigate further. At the Oculory[edit] As he leads you forward, Paratus will explain that the Synod happened on this machine created by the Dwarves for unknown purposes, and that the Synod now intends to try to use it toward some different end. Ascend a curved ramp along a giant sphere, but be careful not to fall off, as doing so can cause you to become stuck. At the top, Paratus will marvel at the magnificence of the device there and ask you to place the crystal into the central apparatus. Insert the Crystal into the gap at the bottom of the large ring. Stand as shown (photo), and place the crystal by activating the ""Dwarven Armillary"". When you have done so, the ring will rotate so that the focusing crystal is positioned at the top. Your objective will become to ""Focus the Oculory"". You will now have two objective markers, one pointing at the device in the center of the room and another at an elevated control console at the southeast part of the room. You can ask Paratus what to do next. Focus is the Key[edit] Paratus will indicate that you should direct some fire and frost spells onto the crystal to change the way that it bends the light beams projected by the device. If you look upward, you will see that the device receives one beam of light vertically, and splits it into three beams projected in various upward directions. The ultimate goal is to converge all of the beams into a pattern that will project an image on the wall below the control console. Puzzle Solution   You may wish to save your game before taking the following steps: You can climb the ramp at the southeast point in the room and obtain one or both spell tomes from the table there if you do not have both the Flames and Frostbite Destruction spells. Only the Frostbite spell will work; it won't move the beams into the correct position if you use any other type of frost spell. The Frost Breath shout will work, but only once, so you can't focus the crystal completely without the use of the Frostbite spell. Return to the same position that you assumed when placing the crystal. Notice that there are three horizontal blue bands circling the upper portion of the room, each with a round reflector positioned at some point around it. Direct a Frostbite spell into the middle of the ring where you placed the crystal. When the beams move, cast a second Frostbite spell. When the beams move again, cast a third Frostbite spell. Note that Frostbite moves the lenses to the next ""forward"" position and casting Flames will move them ""backward"".  Handy if you cast Frostbite too many times. Do not use other spells.  Step 5: Beam configuration after using spellsEnsure that each of the three beams of light are now pointing into the middle of each blue band (none of the beams should point to the horizontal gold rims that separate the bands). You will need to move around to check all three beams. The photo indicates a correct configuration as viewed from the control console at the top of the ramp.  When the lenses are in the correct position they will shine on the center of each band, not on the edges.  A focused OcularyWalk up the ramp at the southeast point in the room and use the buttons to rotate the bands until the round reflector on each band aligns with a light beam. The left button controls the top band, so press that until the beam aimed at the center of the top band meets the reflector. Then use the middle button to do the same for the middle band, and the right button to do so for the lower band. A sequence that will result in the proper alignment is: Activate the left button once. Activate the middle button six times. Activate the right button five times. When the Oculory is correctly focused, it will appear as shown. When the Oculory is correctly focused, Paratus will be initially excited, but then begin to exclaim with distress that there is something wrong. He will communicate that the map should show more, and speculate that there is some kind of interference coming from Winterhold. He may accuse you of attempting to stall his work and suspiciously ask if you knew what they are trying to do. Talk to Paratus[edit] Paratus will be looking at a map projected onto the wall under the control console. Speak to him and he will accuse you of trying to sabotage the Synod's efforts and demand that you explain yourself. Whatever the course of the ensuing conversation, Paratus will ask if—or assume that—you have something ""powerful"" at your college. He will be suspicious about this and toward you, stating that he will be reporting the information to the Synod Council. You'll learn that the Synod intended to use the device to scan the continent for powerful sources of magic, ""for the good of the Empire"". One way or another, Paratus will let you know that the map indicates that the Staff of Magnus is in Labyrinthian. You must now report this information to the Arch-Mage, Savos Aren. After that, once you head towards the southern exit, a Psijic Monk called Nerien will briefly spawn to comment: ""You have done well thus far, but trying times are ahead. It is imperative that you return to your College at once. You will be called on to take swift action. Rise to the challenge,  and discover what you are capable of. You are on the right path, and you will prevail."" Report to Savos Aren[edit] You may now take a shortcut exit or return the long way back through the ruin. To take the shortcut, leave the room containing the Oculory. A short distance ahead, just past the barrels in the hallway, there is an exit door to the right. If you turn toward it, Nerien, the Psijic Order member who appeared to you in Saarthal, will visit you again. He will warn you that you will encounter difficulties ahead, but assure you that you are on the right path and that you will prevail. He will then urge you to return to the College immediately. You will not receive Nerien's visit if you leave through the main entrance, but this will not impact your progress through the quest. Ancano casting a spell on the Eye of Magnus As you enter the Hall of the Elements, you'll find Arch-Mage Savos and Mirabelle in a panic. The gate to the room containing the Eye of Magnus is blocked by a barrier that Mirabelle speculates is some kind of ward, and the two of them implicate Ancano in possibly creating it. They will then begin casting Destruction spells at the barrier in an attempt to destroy it. If you speak to Savos, he will ask for your help in destroying the barrier, and say that they need to know what Ancano is doing in there. You can help break down the barrier with Destruction spells, but whether you do or not, the door will eventually open, and they will rush in. Savos will approach Ancano, who is casting a spell at the Eye, and command him to stop. Mirabelle will warn Savos not to go near Ancano, but Savos will begin casting a spell at him. At this point, all will go white, and the next thing you experience will be awakening in the Hall of the Elements with Mirabelle asking if you are all right and saying that she needs your help. When you reply that you think you feel well, this quest will complete and the next quest, Containment, will begin with the objective of finding the Arch-Mage, as Mirabelle requests of you. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: Revealing the Unseen (10 points/Bronze)"

Return to Madesi.","All the necessary components Speak with Madesi and ask him about his jewelry. You will learn that he is running low on supplies due to heavy bandit presence on the roads and needs help gathering some components. He requires two flawless sapphires, one mammoth tusk, and one piece of gold ore. Flawless sapphires, like all gems, can be randomly found or mined. One guaranteed sample can be stolen from the shelves in the Inner Sanctum of the Temple of Dibella in Markarth. Mammoth tusks can be looted from slain mammoths, as well as bought from hunters and certain merchants. Three guaranteed samples can be found in the College of Winterhold's Arcanaeum; eight guaranteed samples can be found in Halted Stream Camp. The closest one is in Black-Briar Meadery, where it can be stolen from the shelves of a cupboard in Indaryn's bedroom. Gold ore can be found randomly in containers or in buildings, but an easy place to find some gold veins is in Kolskeggr Mine. There's also Lost Prospect Mine; while the latter is closer, it doesn't have as many veins as Kolskeggr Mine.  Alternately, one can just use the Transmute spell to turn one Iron Ore into one Gold Ore. You can return the items to Madesi as you find them, or all at once. He will give you 100 gold for each item returned (i.e., 200 for the two sapphires).

Talk to Stig Salt-Plank in Dawnstar. Depart for Japhet's Folly with Adelaisa Vendicci. Kill Haldyn and report back to Adelaisa. Speak to Orthus.","The East Empire Company[edit] ""Please excuse the mess."" The East Empire Company is a huge organization that originated in Vvardenfell and later set up operations in Skyrim: a warehouse in  Solitude and an official office in Windhelm. The warehouse near Solitude is off limits, but talking to the guard outside will provide some information on the problems the Company is experiencing. The guard will then point you towards the Windhelm office, specifically an Imperial named Orthus Endario who works there. Travel to the Windhelm dockside office; it will be unlocked between 4am and 8pm, so enter the office and take a look around. The place is falling apart, the shelves are empty, and cobwebs cover most of the ceilings. Orthus will be inside, either trying to clean the place up or eating, and will immediately apologize for the horrible state of the place. When asked, he will explain that pirate attacks have managed to stop all shipments to the Company, from Hammerfell to Vvardenfell, and that the Shatter-Shield clan are the only ones who receive shipments. Apparently, the Shatter-Shields run a private shipping operation, and would be more than pleased with a monopoly at the docks. Orthus has no proof against the clan, but will point you towards a Dark Elf named Suvaris Atheron who works in the Shatter-Shield Office next door. He then hints at Suvaris' logbook, which could contain evidence that the clan is acquainted with the pirates. The quest will now start and you will have to break into the office and steal the logbook. The Logbook[edit] Breaking into the Shatter-Shield Office is not overly difficult. At 8pm, Suvaris Atheron leaves the office to go drink and sleep at New Gnisis Cornerclub until 8am. You can then pick the lock and enter unnoticed. If you're not comfortable with picking Expert locks, you can pickpocket the key from Suvaris. Another strategy is to simply enter the office during the day, while Suvaris is there and the door is unlocked. She is not exactly unwelcoming to visitors, nor does she make much of an effort at guarding her logbook, so wait until she sits down at the table near the front door, then claim the logbook from the table in the northwestern alcove. Leave the office and return to Orthus. When you hand over the logbook, Orthus will read through it and discover that Suvaris often traveled to Dawnstar to meet up with a bunch of pirates, led by captain Stig Salt-Plank. He will also explain more on the pirates and reveal them as the Blood Horkers, a clever bunch not to be trifled with. He suspects the pirates can be found at the local inn, so travel to Dawnstar and enter the Windpeak Inn. The Blood Horkers[edit] ""You beasts are the worst."" Inside the Inn, you will find Stig Salt-Plank boozing it up with his Blood Horker companions Alding, Gjuk, and Irlof. They are obviously unwelcome and seemingly unpleasant towards the tavern's bard, Karita: Karita: ""You beasts are the worst."" Stig: ""Come now, dearie, surely we aren't all that bad."" Karita: ""Just... leave me alone! I've brought your mead, now drink it and shut your filthy mouths."" Alding: ""Oh, we've got other things in mind for our mouths, sweetie."" Locate Stig Salt-Plank and ask him if he knows about the Blood Horkers. He will laugh in your face and admit he'd been captaining them for nine years, then proceed to ask why you are so interested. Pretend to be interested in the ship plundering business and Stig will tell you about someone named Haldyn, referring to him as their 'secret ingredient', as he is a powerful battlemage and functions as the leader of the Blood Horkers. Keep pretending to be interested in joining the Horkers and Stig will get suspicious; you can choose to bribe him or challenge him to a brawl. Both options will lead to him telling you about the hiding place of Haldyn, a place called Japhet's Folly. Alternatively, you can pickpocket Stig's note that mentions both Haldyn and Japhet's Folly, or kill him and take it off his corpse.  Attacking or killing Stig will not result in a bounty, or even retaliation by his crew; the player may kill all the pirates with no penalty. Adelaisa[edit] ""Sorry isn't good enough, Orthus."" When you return to the Windhelm docks, a new ship has arrived and will be docked right outside the East Empire Company office. Inside, you will find that Orthus has received a visit from a company superior, namely Adelaisa Vendicci, who will be understandably upset with the state of the place and the lack of effort on Orthus' part: Orthus: ""Adelaisa, I'm sorry."" Adelaisa: ""Sorry isn't good enough, Orthus. There's a lot of gold at stake here, and sniveling isn't going to get it back."" Orthus: ""I've got a top man/woman on the job right now. He/She should be returning any moment."" Adelaisa: ""This must be him/her, then."" If you talk to Orthus, he will briefly introduce Adelaisa and point you towards her; when you approach, she will be grateful to finally see someone who can get things done and order you to join her on her mission to stop the Blood Horkers once and for all. When you reveal the name Haldyn to her, she realizes the danger of the mission and will immediately exit the office. Head outside to the docked ship and talk to the East Empire mercenary and agree to tag along on the journey to Japhet's Folly, an isolated island on the very northern border of Skyrim. During the trip, a strange fog forces the ship to drop anchor outside the island, and Adelaisa suspects Haldyn to be responsible for the sudden change in weather. With all her mercenaries too scared of Haldyn to react, Adelaisa will ask you to take out the battlemage, thus making the fog disappear. This should clear the way for the ship and an attack can be launched. You will have no choice but to accept, so jump off the railing and use the many blocks of ice as a path to Japhet's Folly. Follow the map marker to the hidden sea cave and enter. There is no use trying to shortcut by storming the main gate of the pirates' camp alone, as the door to the stone fortress requires a key found inside the fortress. (Note: Picking the Master-level lock on the compound with the Wax Key perk will give you a copy of the key required to enter the fortress, bypassing the cave entirely.) Kill Haldyn[edit] Haldyn attacks The Sea Cave is a small cave located underneath the folly, inhabited by two to three mudcrabs and a single Blood Horker. Dispose of them all and claim a few healing potions from the shelves, as well as some minor loot from the chests. Proceed up the western slope to a door, leading to Japhet Folly's Tower. As you enter you will hear the sound of more pirates from the level above, so climb the stairs carefully and beware of the pressure plate and the corresponding spike wall along the way. Dispose of the enemies, and open the door to a hallway with a chest and locked door that is your escape route later on. Leave it for now and move on to the next room where you can choose to head either upstairs or downstairs. Proceed downstairs first, where two Blood Horkers await. The remains of Japhet can be found behind a locked door next to a locked boss-leveled chest and an explanatory journal. Backtrack and make your way up the tower. Pick up a couple potions, several alchemy ingredients including two briar hearts and a rare sample of small antlers from a table on the way. As you proceed up the last flight of stairs to the top, you will probably hear a sliding noise; this is several bars sliding out of the floor to block off the archway at the bottom of the stairs that you just walked through. When you reach the top, Haldyn will be there and immediately attack you, showering you with shock spells. Dispose of him and loot his body for the Japhet's Folly key, then claim the treasure from his chest. When you kill Haldyn, the bars on the archway will retract, allowing you to go back the way you came. Backtrack all the way down the stairs to the locked door and unlock it using the key.  (The hallway you came in from will be caved in, so you can't go back that way.  Also, there's no door back to the Sea Cave, so this is your only choice.) Escape from Japhet's Folly[edit] Rise in the East Once outside, you will find yourself in the middle of a regular battlefield as Haldyn's death obviously removed the bad weather surrounding the island. As a result, the East Empire Company mercenaries tear the area to pieces with bombs. The many explosions will not hurt you, but you will have to dispose of all the Blood Horkers that attack you as you make your way towards Adaleisa, who will be waiting on the docks at the bottom of the mountain. When all is said and done, talk to her and she will congratulate you on a job well done and tell you to say the word when you want to return to the mainland. Back in the East Empire Company, Orthus Endario will be overwhelmed with joy and hand you a leveled amount of gold for your trouble. He even suspects the bossy Adelaisa will go easier on him from now on and tells you to return to the office if you ever need help; this means that you can ask Adelaisa to be your follower should you ever need her assistance. Additionally, after a few days, the office will be restored to its former glory and you can take almost all the items there for free."

It is repeatable and there is no limit to the amount of times you can perform the quest. Talk to an Innkeeper[edit] As a vampire, ask any innkeeper if they have heard any rumors. You may need to ask several times before you get the rumor you want. This can be quite time consuming. They will eventually point you toward Falion, a mage who studies draugr, vampires, and other undead in Morthal. Sometimes he will not discuss vampirism with you until you've been told to go see him. Travel to Morthal to Talk with Falion[edit] Travel to Morthal, a town northwest of Whiterun. Falion lives in the easternmost house in town, with his ward. When spoken to he will reveal that he studies the undead (under some amount of disapproval from the town) and that he recognizes you as a vampire. He will offer to remove your vampirism if provided with one filled black soul gem. Finding a Black Soul Gem[edit] Falion and Enthir are the only merchants who are guaranteed to stock black soul gems. The gems also appear randomly, dependent upon your level, on warlocks and in geode veins.  Note that The Black Star will not work. As Falion requires a filled black soul gem, you will then need to fill the soul gem by soul trapping someone. The nearest location with enemies is Fort Snowhawk to the west of Morthal, or Movarth's Lair to the northeast (if the fort has been taken by the Stormcloaks or Imperial Legion). Meet Falion at Dawn[edit] At 3am, Falion will start making his way to the circle and remains there until 7am. Meet him at the summoning circle to the north of town at dawn. He will perform the ritual, during which the screen will fade to black before returning, and you will no longer be a vampire. If you miss meeting him, reload a previous save and retry."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rjorn%27s_Drum","Speak to Giraud Gemane. Travel to Halldir's Cairn. Retrieve Rjorn's Drum. Return to Giraud Gemane.","The Dean of History[edit] Once you have completed the Bards College initiation quest Tending the Flames, the Dean of History, Giraud Gemane, will start saying: ""They found it! They actually found it!"" When asked what 'they' found, he will explain: ""Rjorn's drum! Nobody knows where he died, and therefore where his drum might be. Halldir was the missing link. Rjorn entered Halldir's Cairn in secret, and presumably died there. Now all I need to do is find someone to get it. Wait. You. You could do it. I need you to get me that drum."" He then proceeds to explain why the drum is worth going through the trouble, as Rjorn was the most famous battle drummer of the second age and the drum itself was used at half a dozen famous battles. He finishes with: ""Rjorn was always looking for new stories to tell. It seems he was writing a lay about Halldir when he vanished. That was the missing clue."" Although the task sounds quite dangerous, Giraud will then resume to his usual routine while it is up to you to track down the drum. Halldir's Cairn[edit] Three dead bodies and a beam of energy Halldir's Cairn is a cave, located a small ways southwest of Falkreath. Upon entering, it becomes obvious that something is very wrong in the cave, as you will find the bodies of three dead bandits, Agrius, Vidgrod, and Raen. The three bodies lie around a huge beam of blue light that shoots into a hole in the ceiling, and the various skeletal remains suggest that the position of the dead bandits are not coincidental. Nearby are the three bed rolls, while a pedestal conveniently holds the key to Halldir's crypt along with a journal written by Agrius, detailing the last days of the three bandits: ""Never thought I'd see the day we were run out of the Knifepoint Gang. Least the storm should cover our tracks. Vidgrod, Raen, and I took shelter in a cave for the night. Looks like there's an old ruin here. Least there are no Draugr around."" Unlock the iron door to the southwest and head up the spiral staircase. Pick up the various soul gems along the way and head west at the intersection. As you approach the wooden door, two ghosts will attack you, so dispose of them and unlock the door. Tombs of the Undead[edit] You will enter some catacombs, with another ghost getting up from a throne as you approach. Head up the western set of stairs, past the bone chimes, to another tomb, where draugr enemies will start to rise from their graves, along with more ghosts. A pedestal holds a useful copy of the spell tome Raise Zombie, while the handle to raise the iron bars is found behind the throne. ""Something's wrong. Raen hasn't said a word since she woke up this morning, just keeps staring off into space. Vidgrod isn't much better. They sick? Not like any illness I ever heard of. I'd just walk out on them, but I can't seem to get up the nerve. I feel like something's holding me back. What is this place?"" The next chamber contains a puzzle with rune totems so clear the area of undead and consider picking the lock on the door to the southeast for a locked chest with minor loot. The puzzle is quite simple; the rotating symbols can be found on the pillar in the center of the chamber and need to match the symbols on the wall opposite them. Once all three are positioned correctly, pull the lever and watch the stone wall to the north disappear. Two more ghosts await in the next area and, while you can proceed up the stairs to the north, the western path has a tripwire triggering a battering ram from the ceiling. At the dead end is a chest set up with a tension cable that will release the flamethrower statue, so approach with caution. Take the stairs to the north until you reach your final destination, the chamber of Halldir: Halldir[edit] ""We're not alone. I can hear him now. Someone, speaking in my mind. Old. Powerful. Halldir, that's the name. He wants something from us. Needs us to stay for the magic to work. I tried to run, can't. Just like them."" The powerful draugr, Halldir The chamber is where the blue beam of light ends and as you approach, a powerful draugr, Halldir, will be immersed in it. He is a leveled draugr caster with several Destruction spells. He'll begin to speak in an ancient Nordic tongue as you start to take away his health. At about 66% health, he will disappear and split into three different elemental versions of himself. All three are casters and are spread out enough to make this part rather difficult; as such, magic resistance is recommended. The cold and fire casters are close to the room's entrance, while the lightning version sits apart. Focus on taking out the fire one first as his fire spells will cause massive burst damage. The cold one should be next, as he can severely reduce your movement speed. Finally, take out the lightning version of Halldir, and his ghost should materialize in the very center of the blue beam, obviously living off the souls of the three dead bandits below and before them, Rjorn. His ghost is not particularly powerful but carries the unique Halldir's Staff with a Pacify enchantment, so dispose of the draugr quickly. After the battle, the blue beam of light will disappear and everything goes quiet. You will now have free access to the boss chest, where Rjorn's Drum is hidden, along with a huge amount of valuable loot. Lastly, open the trap door in the middle and follow in the footsteps of Agrius, Vidgrod, and Raen - and legendary battle drummer Rjorn: ""Raen jumped first. Onto the cairn. That's what Master wants - blood, sacrifice, power to live again. His magic, I can feel it pulsing in my blood. He's draining us. We'll serve him soon, our bodies, our souls. Just like the others. They're waiting. It's my turn."" Return with the Drum[edit] Return to Solitude and find Giraud Gemane. When you show him the drum he will be overwhelmed with joy: ""At last!

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Robber%27s_Gorge_(quest)","Note: This quest does not appear in your journal. Investigate Robber's Gorge for a secret trapdoor. Find the journal in Robber's Cove. Follow the clues to the bandit leader's secret treasure.","Ambush[edit] The camp near Karth River On the road between Rorikstead and Dragon Bridge, near Karth River, a group of bandits has taken over an old overhanging bridge and set up a clever method for ambushing travelers and caravans. As soon as you approach the bridge, the bandits will release a few boulders to block the path, then talk to you from their safe spot above: ""All right, that's far enough. You know how this works- toll here is 100 gold."" If you question the meaning of a ""toll"" in the middle of nowhere, you will be told: ""Don't play dumb with me. Pay up, and you walk right through. Refuse, and you'll never see the other side."" You can choose to pay the gold and they will let you pass unharmed, while the other options will make them turn hostile. Regardless of your choice, the bandit camp at Robber's Gorge has been set up right next to the road, so head up there and the bandits will attack anyway. Kill the bandit guarding the entrance and deal with the three on the overhanging bridge, then enter Robber's Gorge through the door. Robber's Gorge[edit] A cave with a clue The huge camp is an extension of the ambush bridge and consists of several tents with bedrolls. A few bandits will attack you on sight as you enter. Your target is the wooden house in the southern section of the camp: the home of the Bandit Leader. He will attack the moment you enter, so defeat him and take a look around for the Archery skill book The Black Arrow, v2 on a table and a chest with some decent loot. The bandit leader carries a boss-leveled amount of gold along with the key to Robber's Cove. Alternatively, a second key can be found on a dresser in one of the bedrooms. Claim the key and locate the trap door leading underground to the hidden cave, Robbers' Cove. A Paranoid Bandit Leader[edit] The island to the south The cove turns out to be a secret sanctuary for the bandit leader and is merely a small ledge and an underground lake filled with salmon. Some food is present along with a docked boat, some weaponry, and an empty chest (this chest will contain the quest item if you are on one of the related quests). If you jump in the water, some more minor treasure can be found as well as several skeletons. Investigate the table and read through the Bandit Leader's Journal. The pages reveal his worries about his relationship with his men and his fears about an upcoming mutiny. He apparently started to take some of the gold earned from the ambushes, a little bit of a time, and was waiting to gather enough gold to escape to Dragon Bridge. Lastly, after one of his companions unexpectedly visited the cove, the bandit leader decided to move his stash to a better location: ""I don't think he found my stash, but it's not safe here. I took the boat out tonight and stowed it on the island to the south, by the old tree stump."" Jump into the water and leave the cove through the southern exit. Keep swimming south and you will immediately see a waterfall. At the foot of the waterfall is the island described in the journal, including the old tree stump. Next to the stump is the bandit leader's stash hidden away in a chest, so use the key to unlock it and claim his ill-gotten gains for yourself."

Some Things Never Change[edit] Old Hroldan Inn is across the hold, almost directly east of Markarth. Traveling along the road will take you near a few Forsworn encampments, but should be relatively safe. It can also be approached by traveling over the mountains to the west of Rorikstead. Leontius Salvius is typically outside chopping wood or on the porch during the day. He can be found inside the inn at night.

Most of his time is spent studying and advising the Jarl on the current dragon threat. However, he does have time to assist the locals in town. If you ask him if he is the only wizard in town, he will acknowledge that while, technically, he is alone in his craft, the town also holds other practitioners. And, since he's on the subject, he remembers he has some frost salts he'd promised to pick up for local alchemist Arcadia, the proprietor of Arcadia's Cauldron. He asks if you wouldn't mind delivering the frost salts; Arcadia will surely compensate you for them. When you tell him you will help him out, he will respond with a disparaging remark, but will hand you the frost salts, a quest item not to be dropped. He'll Never Know What Hit Him[edit] Head to Arcadia's Cauldron and enter during regular business hours, specifically between 8am and 8pm, or even when she strolls around the main trading room in the evening; as always, she will claim you have a fatal disease in hopes you will buy one of her potions, but will be grateful for the salts.

Convince Ainethach to sell the mine, or convince Atar to leave.","Miner Extortion[edit] When you first enter Karthwasten, you will see the townsfolk squaring off against a group of mercenaries sent by the Silver-Blood family in Markarth to secure the mine after a Forsworn incident. Ainethach, the owner of the mine, is arguing with Atar, the leader of the mercenary band: Ainethach: ""I want you sellswords out of my mine."" Atar: ""Watch your tongue, native. We'll leave when we're sure there's no Forsworn here."" Ainethach: ""Oh, and when would that be, I wonder? When I sell my land to the Silver-Bloods?"" Atar: ""The Silver-Bloods have made you a very generous offer for this pile of dirt. I suggest you take it."" The Silver-Bloods are demanding that the mine be signed over to them in return for the protection they provided in the last attack. The mercenaries have been instructed to prevent anyone from returning to work in the Sauranach Mine until the rights to it are signed over to the Silver-Blood family. Deciding to Help Ainethach[edit] Ainethach should be standing on the porch of his house during the day, and once approached he will agree to let you help him, and will ask you to convince Atar to leave. Unless you catch up to the band before they go into the mine, you will need to enter the mine to find Atar in the far end, standing on a raised platform. Talking to Atar[edit] After agreeing to help Ainethach enter the mine and speak with Atar. When you ask him to leave you will be given three options. Option  Dialogue  Reaction   This whole town wants you out. Leave. (Persuade) Passed: Dealing with a mob wouldn't be good for my coin purse. Fine. We're leaving.Failed: Let's see them make us.

Nothing Note that even after successfully persuading, bribing, or intimidating, the mercenaries will claim that the mine is theirs, and will warn against sudden movements. There is no bounty for killing the mercenaries even after they agree to leave. Strong Arm Tactics[edit] An alternative option is to not talk to Atar at all, but to simply kill all the mercenaries. There are no mages or archers in the group, just weak melee fighters and the somewhat more formidable Atar, who is equipped as a bandit chief with leveled heavy armor, heavy shield, and one-handed weapon. The mercenary outside the mine will still greet you with pleasantries even after taking this option. There is no bounty for killing the mercenaries inside the mine, even if you attack first. Selling Out[edit] You can also remedy the situation by speaking to Atar who will offer you a cut of the purchase price if you can convince Ainethach to sell. You have to talk to Ainethach, and will be given the usual persuade, bribe, intimidate options if you tell him ""I think you should sell the mine"".

Don't miss the seven silver ore veins in the mine and the leveled shield that Atar carries (if you decide to kill the mercenaries).

Help her escape the cave.","Caught in a Web[edit] When exploring Southfringe Sanctum you will find a Dunmer conjurer named Selveni Nethri trapped in a spider's web. Obviously she is frantic to escape and pleads with you to cut her down. A Cursed Necromancer[edit] Apparently Selveni's dealings as a necromancer resulted in her daughter being taken from her and sent to the orphanage in Riften. Selveni had gone to Riften to see if she could get her daughter out, but learned her daughter had already been moved. When she returned to the coven, Bashnag accused her of trying to sell him out to the Thalmor. She was cursed and chased off. Because of the curse she has been weakened and can't cast a spell to save her life. She isn't able to escape the Sanctum until the way out is safe, and she is desperate to locate her missing daughter. Clear the Way[edit] You have probably already faced the many resident frostbite spiders on your way in. While it isn't necessary to kill Bashnag and all his fellow spellswords to ensure her safety, the quest will fail if Selveni dies before escaping. Let her know when the way out is clear. She will thank you and move along the path in the spider area to get out of the cave by herself. When she has exited the cave, the quest will be completed.

They will offer to pay you, but will not help if you get caught by any guards. You can refuse the request if you wish. As the target is usually a normal citizen, it is advisable to not use a weapon when attacking those targets you are not requested to kill, as they do not have much health or defense. Using your hands, or shield-bashing them should be sufficient to complete the task without killing them. Return to your employer and they will be thrilled that you have completed the task, sometimes wondering if there was lots of blood or screaming.

Return to Gulum-Ei. Follow him from a safe distance. Confront or negotiate with Gulum-Ei. Return to Mercer.","The Plot Thickens[edit] When you next speak to Mercer, he will remark that the symbol found on the Goldenglow Bill of Sale from Goldenglow Estate is the same as the one on the Promissory Note found at the Honningbrew Meadery, leading him to the conclusion that the Thieves Guild is not, in fact, cursed (as Delvin believes) but is in fact being deliberately acted against by an unknown competitor. Mercer will also reveal that a name mentioned on the Bill is the alias of a former contact of the Guild: an Argonian dockworker for the East Empire Company named Gulum-Ei. Nothing Gets You Nothing[edit] Mercer will send you to the Winking Skeever in Solitude to shake down Gulum-Ei for information regarding the sale of Goldenglow Estate: namely, its purchaser. However, Gulum-Ei is used to dealing with Thieves Guild thugs, and will not forfeit his information easily, out of fear for his own safety. To successfully persuade him, you need a Speech skill of at least 75 (or 53 with the persuasion perk). Intimidation will always fail. Option  Dialogue  Reaction   Identify the buyer and we'll forget what we know. (Persuade) Passed: All right. Had I known the deal would bring me this much trouble, I never would have accepted the gold.Failed: I don't care what you promise. If I tell you the buyer's name and word gets around, it could ruin me! Passed: Identify the buyerFailed: Nothing   What would it take to identify the buyer? (Bribe) Passed: Well, now that you mention it, there is something I've been trying to get my hands on. Passed: Identify the buyer   Give me the buyer's name or I'll kill you. (Intimidate) Failed: Hasn't Mercer Frey taught you people anything? You kill me and your only contact with the East Empire Company vanishes. That's not smart for business. Failed: Nothing If you cannot persuade him, you need to bribe him, although you won't offer him gold as is standard with the bribe option; you have to perform a small theft instead. A buyer of his is looking for Firebrand Wine, and there happens to be a case of it up at the Blue Palace; Gulum-Ei looks to you to steal it for him. The wine itself is easy enough to retrieve. Once you've walked in through the front door of the Palace, the case of wine is sitting on an end table in a corridor to the left of the main staircase. You will know the case because of the 'Firebrand Wine' label clearly pasted on the side of the crate. Quickly and quietly pocket the wine and head back to the tavern to get your critical information. You Didn't Hear It From Me...[edit] When you hand over the wine or were otherwise able to convince him, Gulum-Ei sees fit to compensate you for the effort, and hands over an assortment of Soul Gems as payment. Afterwards, he explains that he was approached by a mysterious woman, who gave him a large sack of gold with which to buy Goldenglow Estate. No name was given, but Gulum-Ei mentions that she was extremely angry, and that this anger was directed at Mercer Frey in particular. With nothing else to say on the matter (despite your suspicions to the contrary) Gulum-Ei takes his leave, declaring your business done. Tailing the Argonian[edit] You will need to follow Gulum-Ei as he leaves the tavern, as you believe he is not wholly forthcoming about the information he has. If he spots you, he will insist that he told you all he knows, and will tell you to stop following him. Eventually he will lead you to the East Empire Company Warehouse, where he works and used to steal goods for the Thieves Guild. Here, you can use the tops of the shelves and stacks to follow him at a close distance without him detecting you, since he will keep to the ground floor. Most of the wall torches lighting the pathways can also be picked up, making it much easier to sneak. The warehouse is also patrolled by mercenaries paid for by the company, and they will attack you on sight. Proceed cautiously and at a distance, as Gulum-Ei is on edge and may occasionally pause to look over his shoulder as if expecting to be followed. Alternatively, you could wait until Gulum-Ei gets far enough ahead of you, and then just kill the wardens if they spot you. Another alternative is to swim in the water, and observe him from there. At the far end of the warehouse, Gulum-Ei will turn around and head back the way he came, so quickly duck out of sight behind a nearby shelf or keg. Gulum-Ei will then take a set of steps down into the water, and around behind a shelving unit to a hidden pathway, leading to a door into Brinewater Grotto. If you lose sight of Gulum-Ei, the entrance to Brinewater Grotto can be hard to find.  After passing the huge barrel, go down the stairs into the water and really hug the stone wall.  You will see a smooth, narrow ramp in the wall that will lead up out of the water by shelving units, then into Brinewater Grotto. Once you follow him into Brinewater Grotto, the quest will update, instructing you to confront Gulum-Ei; tread carefully, as the cave is littered with traps and bandits. While the Thieves Guild frowns upon killing on the job, the bandits are fair game, and you can either fight them toe-to-toe or systematically take them out with sneak attacks. There is also a chest hidden in the water past the second two guards to the left of the path with some valuable goods in it. When you reach the end of the cave, speak to Gulum-Ei and he will reveal the name of the mysterious antagonist to the Guild: Karliah, the thief who murdered the previous Guildmaster, Gallus. If you speak to Gulum-Ei again and tell him that he owes you, he will inform you that he will now act as a fence and buy any stolen items you bring to him as his way of repaying you for sparing him. There are three levers next to the gate. They open the two empty cages and a secret door to the rear of the cavern. Three Horkers may attack in the grotto beyond, but the path leads to the exit to the outside. Return to the Guild for your pay and to tell Mercer your findings. He is (understandably) upset, and deduces where Karliah will be next: a ruin far to the north of Riften known as Snow Veil Sanctum. And for this, Mercer insists that he comes along on your next job... Killing Gulum-Ei[edit] If you do not wish to go to the trouble of tailing the Argonian, you may simply kill him. It is recommended that you kill him stealthily as to avoid incurring a bounty.  If and when you kill him you will receive a new objective: ""Find alternative source of information."" Proceed through the quest exactly as detailed above and where you were supposed to talk to Gulum-Ei there will be a chest with a written confession instead. If you kill him after following him, the note will be on his body; you must read the note in order to advance to the next objective.  If you kill him there is no need to sneak around the guards in either the East Empire Company warehouse or Brinewater Grotto. This makes this mission significantly easier to complete for a non-stealthy character, but you will forfeit the payment and you will not have Gulum-Ei as a fence later on. Reward[edit] Mercer Frey will speak with Tonilia and arrange to have a piece of your Thieves Guild armor upgraded. Note you only get to pick one piece: Thieves Guild Armor - +1 Armor, increases carrying capacity from 20 to 35. Thieves Guild Boots - +1 Armor, increases Pickpocket from 15 to 25. Thieves Guild Gloves - +1 Armor, increases Lockpick from 15 to 25. Thieves Guild Hood - +2 Armor, increases Barter effect from 10% to 15%"

When approached she will introduce herself and ask if you are there to help her as she has finally located Vokun's Crypt.

She will also briefly describe Vokun as ""Some old priest buried here long ago."", hinting at her lack of research and explaining her need for help. She fears the old priest could awaken and prove too powerful a foe, so she wants you to lead her through the ruin and help her fight the opposition. Accept her request and the quest will start. High Gate Ruins[edit] ""Sometimes I just like to watch them burn."" Anska is not your average follower and you will have to escort her safely through the ruin; she is, however, capable of taking care of herself using a variety of leveled wizard spells, so keep an eye out and stay upfront as you proceed into the dungeon. Take the northern tunnel to a huge chamber infested with leveled draugr. Claim some minor loot from the chest in the alcove, then head upstairs and locate the iron door leading north where three more draugr will attack. Go through the room with the alchemy lab and a few useful potions. The next tunnel contains a pressure plate triggering a spike wall, so make sure Anska gets through unharmed. A lever puzzle awaits in the next room, so take a thorough look at the symbols above the southern ledge. From left to right, they are: Eagle—Whale—Fox—Snake. Look around the room for the levers, all of them on pedestals with corresponding symbols. The two first levers are upstairs while the last two are on the ground floor. When all four levers are pulled in the right order, the grate in the middle of the room will disappear, so head downstairs and enter the catacombs through the door. Only one draugr will attack you in the first section of the catacombs and a slide will lead you down to another catacomb area with more draugr. A chest can be found in an alcove, but watch out for the pressure plate and the corresponding darts. Before long, you will reach a room with a leveled soul gem resting on a weight sensitive plate, which releases two draugr from the adjacent coffins if triggered. The locked door to the right contains a chest behind it. Continue into a hallway filled with ancient carvings and numerous pressure plates on the floor, triggering darts or spear traps, then proceed into another puzzle room. Facing the lever, two stone walls cover hidden doors, so pull the lever and watch the wall to the right disappear, then fight the boss-leveled draugr guarding another lever. Pull that lever and the door to the left will open and release yet another boss-leveled draugr. Pull the lever behind him, then head through the now-opened entrance to the east and into Vokun's throne room. Vokun[edit] Anska vs. Vokun Before the throne room, a hallway offers a few potions. As soon as you open the next door, the dragon priest Vokun will burst out of his sarcophagus and use his staff of fireballs to attack you from a distance. Anska will keep her distance from Vokun, but will use her ranged attacks to help out. Defeat the priest and claim his unique mask and his staff from the remains. Proceed to the chamber to the east, where you will find a word wall with a word for the Storm Call Shout. The nearby table holds the sealed scroll for Anska, so pick it up and hand it to her. She will be overwhelmed with joy and hand you the unique spell tome for learning the spell Conjure Flaming Familiar as a reward. Additionally, a boss-leveled chest can be found on the upper level to the north, in an alcove right next to the shortcut back to the first zone of the ruin. Anska will stay behind and try to decipher the scroll indefinitely."

""I was sent here to lead the Thalmor's interests in this corner of Skyrim. It's my mission to root out all Talos worship in this city.""

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Season_Unending","Convince all parties to attend a truce negotiation Talk to Arngeir to get the Greybeards to host the negotiations at High Hrothgar. Talk to both General Tullius in Solitude and Ulfric Stormcloak in Windhelm to get them to attend. Return to High Hrothgar for the negotiations. Take your seat at the negotiating table. Negotiate the treaty. Make a series of decisions about the terms of the truce.","Triggering the Quest[edit] This quest starts early in the concurrent quest, The Fallen, but only if the Jarl of Whiterun (Balgruuf or Vignar) insists that a truce must be negotiated before allowing Dragonsreach to be used to capture a dragon. If either side of the Civil War controls at least eight of the nine holds of Skyrim, a truce can no longer be negotiated, and this quest will automatically be bypassed. If you wish to receive a reward for completing this quest, you must have joined either the Imperial Legion or the Stormcloaks.  Furthermore, it is best to do this quest soon after choosing a side in the civil war.  As you complete more of the Reunification of Skyrim or Liberation of Skyrim quests, it becomes more and more difficult to negotiate a treaty that favors your faction and thus elicit a reward. Organizing a Peace Council[edit] Dialogue Excerpts: Organizing the CouncilArngeir, on his reluctance to host a peace council: You misunderstand our authority. The Greybeards have never involved themselves in political affairs. Arngeir, explaining his change of mind:  Paarthurnax has made the decision to help you. This is the road we have to walk. Even the Greybeards must bend to the winds of change, it seems. So be it. Tell Ulfric and General Tullius that the Greybeards wish to speak to them. We will see if they still remember us. Ulfric Stormcloak's initial response to the Greybeards' message:  I have the greatest respect for the Greybeards, of course. And the dragon attacks are a growing plague. But the political situation is still delicate. Not all the Jarls are fully committed to supporting me as High King.  I can't afford to appear weak. I can't agree to this unless Tullius himself will be there. Tullius' initial response, specifically when warned about the dragon menace:  They are getting to be a problem. But I wasn't sent to Skyrim to fight dragons. My job is to quell this rebellion, and I intend to do just that, dragons or no dragons. Tullius' explanation for why he does not have enough reinforcements (only heard if you go to Tullius first, are not allied with the Stormcloaks, and do not try to persuade him):  Most of the Legion is tied down on the border with the Aldmeri Dominion. The Emperor can't afford to risk weakening Cyrodiil's defenses. From the Imperial City, our war here is just a sideshow. An interlude before the main event against the Thalmor resumes. This is good time to make a hard save to shuffle the randomized holds to trade later on, if they were not the ones you wanted. The Greybeards are the only group who command enough respect to broker a truce in the civil war.  Therefore your first task is to travel to High Hrothgar and convince Arngeir that you need his help to stop the war.  He is initially reluctant, but the fact that a peace council is necessary to defeat Alduin changes his mind. You then need to convince both Ulfric (at the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm) and Tullius (at Castle Dour in Solitude) to attend the truce negotiations.  You can talk to the two leaders in either order, using the dialogue option ""I have a message from the Greybeards"" (if this dialogue option is missing, see the notes).  They will each provide a variety of dialogue options, depending upon the progress of the civil war and whether or not the other leader has already agreed to attend the council.  Each has one persuasion option, which is fastest way to convince them; however, any selection will eventually lead to an option confirming that they will ""come to the peace council"". Starting by talking to Ulfric is somewhat easier, because he can be successfully persuaded as long as your Speech skill is at least 25; Tullius requires a Speech skill of 50 to be persuaded. When you return to High Hrothgar, Arngeir and the other Greybeards will be waiting in the main hall of High Hrothgar, where they have been welcoming everyone to the negotiations.  Beside the Greybeards, the attendees consist of: The Imperial delegation: General Tullius: head of the delegation Legate Rikke: his advisor; provides more colorful reactions to the negotiations Jarl Elisif the Fair of Solitude: also provides more colorful reactions Elenwen: the Thalmor ambassador to Skyrim, and not a welcome addition to the council The Stormcloak delegation: Ulfric: head of the delegation Galmar Stone-Fist: his advisor; provides more colorful reactions to the negotiations The Jarl of Whiterun, either Balgruuf the Greater or Vignar Gray-Mane: plays only a small role; however, he is the primary beneficiary of the truce The Blades: Delphine Esbern Dialogue Excerpts: The Blades vs the GreybeardsThe argument between the Blades and the Greybeards, generic version: Delphine: So, Arngeir, is it? You know why we're here. Are you going to let us in or not? Arngeir: You were not invited here. You are not welcome here. Delphine: We have as much right to be at this council as all of you. More, actually, since we were the ones that put the Dragonborn on this path. Arngeir: Were you? The hubris of the Blades truly knows no bounds Delphine: If it were up to you, the Dragonborn would sit dreaming on this mountain doing nothing! Esbern: Delphine, we're not here to rehearse old grudges. The matter at hand is urgent. Alduin must be stopped. You wouldn't have called this council if you didn't agree. We know a great deal about the situation and the threat that Alduin poses to us all. You need us here if you want this council to succeed. Arngeir:  ""Sighs"" Very well. You may enter. If Paarthurnax has been killed, lines four and five become:  Arngeir: I know what path you set [him/her] on. And now Paarthurnax's wisdom is lost to us, just when we need it most. Delphine: [He/She] did what had to be done. It was long overdue. My only regret is that I wasn't able to kill him myself. If you have instead agreed to not kill Paarthurnax, lines four and five become:  Arngeir: We know what path you've set [him/her] on. But [he/she] has made a different choice. Paarthurnax is still safe from your malice. Delphine: For now. The Blades' memory is long, as you know.    Dialogue Excerpts: Arngeir Starting the Meeting:So, you've done it. The men of violence are gathered here, in these halls whose very stones are dedicated to peace. They may put their weapons down for a moment, but only to gather strength for the next bloodletting. They are not yet tired of war. Far from it. Do you know the ancient Nord word for war? ""Season unending""... so it has proved. The arrival of Delphine and Esbern provokes a small scene because of the mutual dislike between them and the Greybeards, but in the end they put aside their differences for the duration of the council. You can talk to any of the attendees to get their various reactions to being at High Hrothgar or their expectations for the negotiations.  Once you are ready to start the council meeting, you will need to talk to Arngeir — although he will forcibly start the discussion if you avoid him for too long.  His dialogue reveals the meaning behind the quest's name: ""Season unending"" is the ancient Nord term for war, and thus reflects Arngeir's ongoing pessimism about the usefulness of the truce. Once you take your seat at the table you will be unable to get up for the duration of the meeting and the negotiations will start. The Negotiations: Overview[edit] The end result of the negotiations is always that the two sides (the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks) exchange control over one or more holds — the government (most notably the governing Jarl) in any exchanged hold is replaced. Your role in the negotiations is to make a series of decisions about which holds are exchanged, and other terms of the truce. Regardless of your choices, a truce is always signed at the end of the quest, but the terms of the truce affect subsequent gameplay, and control whether or not you get a quest reward. The holds initially controlled by each side are dependent upon your progress in the Civil War, meaning that the available options during the negotiations can vary substantially. The primary factor influencing the quest is which side you have joined (if any) in the Civil War; this alters the overall options, as well causing more subtle changes to various dialogues. Therefore, the exact dialogue you hear may differ slightly from any provided quotations. Despite the variations in the quest details, the negotiations always follow a fixed overall pattern: Pre-negotiation: Decide whether or not Elenwen can attend the negotiations. Ulfric objects to having a Thalmor representative at the table.  You get to decide whether she stays or leaves. Phase One: Two holds are exchanged One side demands that they be given a major hold (The Reach or The Rift).  The requested hold is predetermined, and cannot be negotiated. The other side requests a hold in exchange.  In most cases, you are given the choice between two possible holds (a major hold or a minor hold). Break in negotiations: Esbern's Speech Following phase one, one of the two sides usually balks at the terms, threatening to walk out of the negotiations.  Esbern needs to intercede with a speech reminding everyone about the threat posed by Alduin before negotiations can resume. Phase Two: Even out the terms of the truce A series of offers is made to appease the side that warned the congregation that they would leave.  You are given the choice of whether to accept or refuse each of the offers.  These offers continue either until the truce is balanced (neither side is favored by the overall truce) or until all options have been exhausted. Conclusion Arngeir reviews all the terms of the treaty, and the two sides agree to them. Throughout these negotiations, the game maintains an internal score reflecting the currently agreed-upon terms.  A net score of zero means that the truce is balanced and does not favor either side.  A positive score means the treaty currently favors the Imperials, whereas a negative one favors the Stormcloaks.  The scores associated with each choice in the negotiation are summarized in the tables in the following sections, for the Imperial and Stormcloak variants of the quest.  Scoring System Details further explains the scoring system and the negotiation options, for those interested in a more thorough understanding of the quest. If the final score is not zero, the side favored by the treaty is pleased by the results. If you have joined that side's faction you will receive as reward one leveled enchanted weapon. If instead your side is left at a disadvantage, you are accused of betraying your side, but there are no permanent repercussions. (This was not always meant to be the case—see the Notes section for details.) If you do this quest late in the Civil War it may be impossible to negotiate a treaty that favors your faction and therefore impossible to receive the reward. Allied with the Imperials or Neutral[edit] The following table summarizes the options available during negotiation if you have joined the Imperial Legion or if you have never joined either side. In this scenario, Whiterun is considered to be controlled by the Imperials.  Therefore the aim of negotiations is for Ulfric to agree to not attack Whiterun, causing him to start negotiations by demanding that Markarth (and its hold, the Reach) be given to the Stormcloaks. Stage Option Score   Pre-Negotiation  Elenwen stays +1    Elenwen leaves -1    Phase One: Stormcloak Demand Markarth and The Reach are given to the Stormcloaks (no choice) -2    Phase One: Imperial Concession Riften and The Rift are given to the Imperials (only if The Rift has not been taken) +2    Winterhold and its hold, or Dawnstar and The Pale, are given to the Imperials (chosen at random) +1    Phase Two — if score is negative or zero   Each of the following options is offered (if available), and can be accepted or declined until the score reaches zero or there are no more options.    Stormcloaks pay compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten +1     Dawnstar and The Pale, or Winterhold and its hold, are given to the Imperials (whichever was not an option in Phase One, if that hold is not already controlled by the Imperials) +1    Phase Two — if score is positive   Each of the following options is offered (if available), and can be accepted or declined until the score reaches zero or there are no more options.    The Empire pays compensation for the massacre at Darkwater Crossing (see Bugs) -1     Falkreath and its hold, or Morthal and Hjaalmarch, are given to the Stormcloaks (chosen at random) -1 Allied with the Stormcloaks[edit] The following table summarizes the options available during negotiation if you have completed Joining the Stormcloaks. Tullius begins negotiations by demanding that Riften (and its hold, the Rift) be given to the Imperials. Stage Option Score   Pre-Negotiation  Elenwen leaves -1    Elenwen stays +1    Phase One: Imperial Demand Riften and The Rift are given to the Imperials (no choice) +2    Phase One: Stormcloak Concession Markarth and The Reach are given to the Stormcloaks (only if The Reach has not been taken) -2    Morthal and Hjaalmarch, or Falkreath and its hold, are given to the Stormcloaks (chosen at random) -1    Phase Two — if score is positive or zero   Each of the following options is offered (if available), and can be accepted or declined until the score reaches zero or there are no more options.    The Empire pays compensation for the massacre at Darkwater Crossing (see Bugs) -1     Falkreath and its hold, or Morthal and Hjaalmarch, are given to the Stormcloaks (whichever was not an option in Phase One, if that hold is not already controlled by the Stormcloaks) -1    Phase Two — if score is negative   Each of the following options is offered (if available), and can be accepted or declined until the score reaches zero or there are no more options.    Stormcloaks pay compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten +1     Dawnstar and The Pale, or Winterhold and its hold, are given to the Imperials (chosen at random) +1 Scoring System Details[edit] This section explains the source of the numbers and options listed in the tables in the previous two sections.  If you are simply interested in completing this quest as quickly as possible, this section probably is not of interest. The status of the negotiations is tracked internally by a score, which ideally totals zero at the end of the discussion.  If the score is greater than zero, the treaty favors the Imperials, and the Stormcloaks will ask for more concessions (if possible).  The reverse holds if the score is negative.  Factors that contribute to the score are: Each major hold that changes sides counts for two points. Major holds are holds that contain a walled capital city — The Reach and The Rift are the only two that can be traded during the truce Each minor hold that changes sides counts for one point. Minor holds are holds whose capital city is not walled — Falkreath Hold, Hjaalmarch, The Pale, and Winterhold Whether or not Elenwen is allowed to attend the council meeting counts for one point. Only the Stormcloaks will be asked to pay compensation for a massacre in one of Skyrim's towns, which counts for one point. There is recorded dialogue present in the game files which indicates there were originally plans to make it possible for both sides to be asked to pay compensation for a massacre which could have happened at variety of possible locations. Only the alleged Stormcloak massacre at Karthwasten was actually implemented into the game upon release. An Imperial massacre at Darkwater Crossing was coded for the Stormcloak concessions, but no dialogue exists for this option (see Bugs). The options presented during the truce are controlled by who owns which holds in Skyrim. The initial sides for each hold are as follows: Imperial Stormcloaks   Home Hold (never traded) Haafingar (Solitude) Eastmarch (Windhelm)   Major Hold The Reach (Markarth) The Rift (Riften)   Minor Hold #1 Falkreath Hold (Falkreath) The Pale (Dawnstar)   Minor Hold #2 Hjaalmarch (Morthal) Winterhold (Winterhold) The ninth hold is Whiterun Hold, which is originally neutral.  It is not part of any trades in Season Unending because it is implicitly at the heart of the negotiations: the primary goal of the truce is to get the side that does not currently control Whiterun to agree to cease attacks on the hold. The opening demand is always made by the side that is opposed to the Dragonborn's allegiance. The demand is that they be given a major hold. This means that the opening demand is always for The Reach (if being made by the Stormcloaks) or for The Rift (if being made by the Imperials). Even if the civil war has started, these holds are guaranteed to have their original affiliation: the winning side is being asked to give up a hold, and the winning side has also never lost any of its original holds. The options get more complicated with the counter-demand. Now the side that is winning the civil war is asking the losing side to give up a hold — but the losing side may have already lost one or two of its original holds. Normally, you get to choose between the losing side's major hold and one of its minor holds. However, the major hold may have already been lost in the civil war, in which case it cannot be traded. A minor hold is always available (once both minor holds have been conquered, the winning side controls eight holds and Season Unending will not start). After phase one of the negotiations, two holds have been exchanged, and the score can range from -2 to +2. In phase two, the game effectively tries to change the score closer to zero. In negotiation terms, the side that is unhappy with the existing terms is demanding concessions, and is not willing to give away any more land. Only minor holds can be traded in phase two. Furthermore, only minor holds that have not previously been traded in the negotiations are available — the minor hold (if traded) at phase one is never offered. The Negotiations: Details and Dialogue[edit] Elenwen[edit] Dialogue Excerpts: Elenwen's AttendanceThe initial scene: Arngeir: Now that everyone is here, please take your seats so we can begin. I hope that we have all come here in the spirit of... Ulfric: No. You insult us by bringing her to this negotiation? Your chief Talos-hunter? Rikke (muttered): That didn't take long. Galmar (muttered): Hear, hear! Balgruuf (muttered): Diplomatic as usual. Elenwen: I have every right to be at this negotiation. I need to ensure that nothing is agreed to here that violates the terms of the White-Gold Concordat. Tullius: She's part of the Imperial delegation. You can't dictate who I bring to this council. Arngeir: Please. If we have to negotiate the terms of the negotiation, we will never get anywhere. Perhaps this would be a good time to get the Dragonborn's input on this matter. Tullius' reasons for why Elenwen should stay:  What do you think? Are we going to let Ulfric dictate terms to us before the negotiations even start? ...I can't be making concessions before negotiations even start. It makes the Empire look weak. Ulfric's reasons for why Elenwen should leave:  By Ysmir's beard, the nerve of those Imperial bastards, eh? To think that we would sit down with that... Thalmor bitch. Either she walks or I do. ...bringing her here is a deliberate provocation. Tullius needs to know I won't be pushed around. If Elenwen leaves, her parting comments are:  Very well, Ulfric. Enjoy your petty victory. The Thalmor will treat with whatever government rules Skyrim. We would not think of interfering in your civil war. If Elenwen stays, the dialogue is instead:  Ulfric: But she is to observe, nothing more. We are not negotiating with her, is that clear?  Elenwen: Ulfric, why so hostile? After all, it's not the Thalmor that's burning your farms and killing your sons. Rikke: She's supposed to be on our side? Ulfric: You know exactly... no. Not this time.  Either way, Arngeir will conclude with:  Now that that's settled, may we proceed? Before Ulfric sits down at the council table, he insists that the Thalmor representative, Elenwen, be removed.  Either Tullius or Ulfric (depending upon your affiliation) will ask you to decide what should be done.  Although you may have to go through an extra round of dialogue if your decision is unpopular, your decision is always obeyed.  Having her stay makes the Imperials happier with the overall truce, but causes Galmar to nearly storm out.  Conversely, her departure makes the Stormcloaks happier, but angers Rikke.  Other than this incident, she has no real role in the negotiations. Phase One[edit] Dialogue Excerpts: Phase OneIf Ulfric makes the initial demand: Ulfric: We want control of Markarth. That's our price for agreeing to a truce. Elisif: So that's why you're here, Ulfric? You dare to insult the Greybeards by using this council to advance your own position? Tullius: Jarl Elisif, I'll handle this. Elisif: General, this is outrageous! You can't be taking this demand seriously! I thought we were here to discuss a truce! Tullius: Elisif! I said I'd handle it.  Ulfric, you can't seriously expect us to give up Markarth at the negotiating table. You hope to gain in council what you've been unable to take in battle, is that it? Arngeir: I'm sure Jarl Ulfric does not expect something for nothing. Rikke (muttered aside): Yes, that'd be entirely out of character. If Tullius makes the initial demand:  Tullius: Our terms are simple. Riften must be returned to Imperial control. That's our price for agreeing to a truce. Vignar (if he is present): Elisif, are you really going to be a party to this foolishness? Do you really think Ulfric will just turn Riften over because some Imperial general barked an order? Galmar (if Vignar is not present): By Talos, the stones on this one! You're in no position to dictate terms to us, Tullius! Ulfric: That's quite an opening demand, Tullius. Vignar or Galmar: Ulfric, you can't be taking this demand seriously? We can hold Riften against anything the Empire can throw at it. Besides, Jarl Laila will never agree to... Ulfric: [Vignar/Galmar]. We will do whatever I decide is in the best interests of Skyrim. Are we clear? Vignar or Galmar: Yes, my lord. Ulfric: Come on, Tullius, you can't seriously expect us to just hand over Riften at the negotiating table. You haven't been able to take it back yet. Why should we give it up now? Even after everyone sits down, there are more delays, with a short speech from the side that is not in control of Whiterun emphasizing their reluctance to be participating in these truce negotiations.  Nevertheless, Arngeir is able to convince everyone to get down to business, at which point the opening demand is made: that a major hold (the Reach or the Rift) be given up.  The other side thinks the demand is outrageous, but eventually gives in to the request.  You have no say in this part of the negotiations — and in fact you can't do anything other than listen to everyone else. However, when it comes time to make a counter-demand, everyone turns to you: you are asked to suggest which hold should be exchanged for the Reach/Rift.  As detailed above, there are multiple options for the counter-demand, but normally you are able to suggest either a minor hold or a major hold.  The major hold (the other of the Reach or the Rift) is always the choice that is favored by your side, and is immediately accepted. If you instead suggest the minor hold, your side will question the decision, and give you another chance to opt for the major hold.  You can change your mind, or else persuade your side to go with the minor hold.  Should your Speech skill be at least 75, you are able to convince your side that the minor hold has some small advantage.  If you fail the persuasion check you instead have to fall back on ""You asked my opinion. I gave it to you,"" which forces a reluctant acceptance of your decision. The large range of possible holds under discussion means that there are many possible dialogues during this discussion.  In particular, each hold has a different set of dialogues detailing the advantages to controlling that hold. Esbern's Speech[edit] Dialogue Excerpts: Esbern's Speech Esbern: Stop! Are you so blind to our danger that you can't see past your petty disagreements? Here you sit arguing about... nothing! While the fate of the land hangs in the balance! Ulfric: Is he with you, Delphine? If so, I advise you to tell him to watch his tongue. Delphine: He is with me. And I advise you both to listen to what he has to say, before you do anything rash. Esbern: Don't you understand the danger? Don't you understand what the return of the dragons means? Alduin has returned! The World-Eater! Even now, he devours the souls of your fallen comrades! He grows more powerful with every soldier slain in your pointless war! Can you not put aside your hatred for even one moment in the face of this mortal danger? If Elenwen is present:  Elenwen: A very pretty speech, but what does it have to do with— Ulfric (if the score is positive): Shut up.! Tullius (if the score is negative): That's enough out of you! Continuation:  Ulfric (if the score is positive): If he's right about Alduin... we both have just as much to lose here, Tullius, remember that. Tullius (if the score is negative): I don't know about the end of the world, but this dragon situation has gotten out of hand. If this truce will help the Dragonborn here put an end to that menace, we both gain. Remember that, Ulfric. With an exchange of holds now on the table, the two sides of the negotiation take stock.  The side that is currently getting the worse end of the deal announces the terms are completely unacceptable and threatens to walk out.  (If the deal is even, neither side will stand up and issue this warning that they will leave, with Esbern's speech being preceded by other arguments.) Before the entire truce is abandoned, Esbern intervenes with an impassioned plea reminding everyone about the importance of these negotiations.  In particular, he emphasizes that any soldiers killed in the war end up strengthening Alduin, because the dragon feeds on their souls. Fortunately, his speech is enough to persuade everyone to sit back down and resume the talks. Additionally, if you allowed Elenwen to stay, she will begin to respond to the speech, but either Tullius or Ulfric will interrupt. The person who responds is determined by whoever has gotten the shorter end of the negotiations so far. Phase Two[edit] Dialogue Excerpts: Phase TwoMost colorful complaint from Tullius: Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it Colovian brandy. These terms are still not acceptable. Most colorful complaint from Ulfric:  Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it mead. These terms are still not acceptable. Accusing the Stormcloaks of a massacre:  Rikke: You slaughtered the very people you claim to be fighting for! True sons of Skyrim would never do such things. Galmar: Damned Imperial lies! My men would never stoop to such methods, even in retaliation for your butchery at... Ulfric: This is our homeland, Tullius. All the blood spilled in this war is on your head. Tullius (if compensation given): For once you'll actually pay for your crimes. Tullius (if compensation denied): Once again, the Empire takes the blame for the crimes of others. Accusing the Imperials of a massacre:  Galmar: You slaughtered them - the women, the children! You butchers! Rikke: That's a lie! My legionnaires are disciplined, unlike your... Tullius: You don't really expect compensation every time a farm gets burned in a war that you started, do you Ulfric? Ulfric (if compensation given): Do you hear that, Tullius? The blood of the innocent cries out for weregild. Ulfric (if compensation denied): And so the Empire runs roughshod over Skyrim, as usual. The side that was about to walk out is now given the chance to suggest additional truce terms to appease them and even out the overall agreement.  These options can include asking to be paid reparations (e.g., an undisclosed sum of gold) for a massacre that took place or asking to be given one or more minor holds.  In each case, you get to decide whether to agree to the additional term. If additional terms are accepted and it evens out the treaty, then negotiations end.  Otherwise, the disgruntled side continues to complain about the unfairness of the treaty, and then come up with another suggestion.  If there are no remaining options, this unhappy faction will abruptly switch from refusing to accept the truce to instead conceding that it's the fairest deal they are likely to get. The Completed Treaty[edit] Once the negotiations have reached their conclusion, Arngeir will summarize all of the terms that have been agreed upon so far, and confirm those terms with each of the parties.  Tullius and Ulfric will both agree (albeit with some grumbling), and the meeting will adjourn. The side with which you are affiliated will talk to you and tell you their opinion of the treaty.  If the treaty favors them, they will be happy and give you a reward.  If the treaty is neutral, they will be ""disappointed,"" believing that ""You gave too much away. More than was necessary to secure this truce.""  If the treaty goes against them, they will say that your actions ""were a disgrace"" and will accuse you of betraying them at every turn. If you are an Imperial soldier, and the treaty is against them, Tullius will claim you are not loyal, saying ""You swore an oath of loyalty to the Emperor, do you remember that?""  You have a choice of possible responses, but there are no repercussions, even if you respond with ""I thought you needed to be taken down a notch."" Most of the parties will head back to their respective cities, but the Greybeards, the Blades, and the faction currently controlling Whiterun, the Empire if neutral will remain to talk with you about how to proceed with trapping a dragon, thus automatically leading back to the quest The Fallen. Esbern will teach you that the names of dragons are always three words of power, and inform you that while you were preparing the negotiations, he retrieved a scroll listing the names of many of the dragons slain by the Blades. Cross-checking it with Delphine's map of Dragon Burials, he discovered that the next dragon's name is Odahviing. While he won't be compelled to come when called, dragons are, naturally, arrogant creatures, and he will not ignore this challenge. More notably, your recent victory in the previous battle against Alduin will make him even more likely to respond to your Voice. Esbern will then teach you the shout to call Odahviing. In addition, Delphine will walk up and demand that you kill Paarthurnax, if the quest hasn't already been given. Once Season Unending is complete, the Civil War will be on hold until the Main Quest is complete. With the addition of the patch, on speaking to Esbern he will confront you about Paarthurnax, before giving you the word Odahviing starting the Paarthurnax quest."

Sell stalhrim equipment.","The Thalmor ship at Northshore Landing During the quest A New Source of Stalhrim, you will encounter the Thalmor at an abandoned dock with a ruined shack located at the northwestern tip of Solstheim, Northshore Landing. The landing is inhabited only by a few mudcrabs and will return to having only mudcrabs after the completion or failure of the quest. They seek to obtain stalhrim equipment for the Aldmeri Dominion. As soon as you near the ship, a Thalmor Guard will approach you and suggest you move along. You now have two options, one to begin negotiations with Ancarion, and the second to begin conflict. You can choose to fight the entire crew or you can ask to talk to the leader. The latter will make him point you towards Ancarion, who will be wandering around on-deck. Ancarion will be angry from the start but willing to talk. When you mention the Stalhrim map, he will admit to torturing Baldor, and then turn his attention to you: ""So you know my purpose here, then? I suppose you must have found that dullard of a blacksmith. Unfortunately for you, my mission here is also a secret. To protect it, I have no choice but to silence you. Now, give me one good reason that I should not kill you where you stand."" Three options are available. Note that successfully completing the third option and starting the hidden quest requires a hard Speech check skill. The check is either at least 75 or 53.  Dialogue Thalmor Soldier:  ""You are trespassing here, I strongly suggest you move.""  You will pay for your crimes against Skaal. Prepare to die! I have business to discuss with your leader. Ancarion: ""Do not test me or I promise that you will regret it. I'm here about the Stalhrim map. Ancarion: ""So you know my purpose here then. I suppose you must have found that dullard of a blacksmith. Unfortunately for you, my mission here is also a secret. To protect it I have no choice but to silence you. Now give me one good reason that I should not kill you where you stand.""   The blacksmith won't talk. You're wasting your time (Persuade) Passed:  (Gives map to player) I admit, we are not making the progress I'd hoped. Perhaps you are right, this venture might be more trouble than it's worth. Very well, you have convinced me. We will depart the island shortly and seek our weapons elsewhere. Failed:   (Attacks player) You dare to question me? That insult will be your last!   Leave this island now, or your life is forfeit. (Intimidate) Passed:   (Gives map to player) I can see that is no idle threat. Very well, we will depart the island once we have loaded the ship. No weapon is worth dying for, not even a weapon forged from Stalhrim. Here, give this map to the blacksmith. I have no further need of it. Failed:   (Attacks player) You dare threaten me? For that insolence, I will flay the flesh from your bones!   You want Stalhrim weapons, and I think I can help you get them. Ancarion: Here to make me an offer, then? Very well, what do you have in mind? The smith said he'd teach me how to make Stalhrim weapons. Ancarion: And you will sell them to me. I suppose I'll have to give you the map first? Yes, otherwise he'll teach me nothing. You can trust me. (Persuade) Passed:   (Quest given) I might not trust you, but I will trust your greed. Very well, take the map. Return here with Stalhrim weapons and armor, and I will pay you a fair price for them. Tell the blacksmith whatever lie you will. We have no further need of him. Failed:   (Attacks Player) You expect me to just hand you the map, so you can deliver it to the blacksmith and laugh at the foolish Thalmor you so easily outwitted?

Return to Skaal Village and seek out the blacksmith who will have returned from his captivity by now. When you hand him the map he will provide a very special reward, namely the ability to create stalhrim weapons and armor: ""I know you faced great danger to bring this map to me. There are no words to tell how glad my heart is. Thank you, brave one. I name you friend of the Skaal, and I will trust you with the knowledge of forging stalhrim. If you bring stalhrim here to my forge, you can use my tools to make what you will from it."" This completes the quest, but will also attract the attention of residing historian Tharstan who will seek you out with a new assignment. Stalhrim equipment can be found as random loot on Solstheim. Glover Mallory when at reasonably high appropriate levels (35+) may be stocked with Stalhrim equipment, so you may be able to buy weapons off of him and keep the mined Stalhrim you have earned. When you complete the prerequisite quest, it can also be forged if you have the Ebony Smithing perk. Return to Ancarion when you have obtained a stalhrim weapon or armor piece, and he will be willing to purchase it. There is, however, a bug that makes it so he does not have any gold."

Report back to Arano and obtain the key to Severin Manor. Retrieve the evidence from the safe in Severin Manor. Travel through Ashfallow Citadel and kill the conspirator. Return to Arano, and follow him to receive your reward from Councilor Morvayn.","The Conspiracy[edit] Once you have completed March of the Dead and The Final Descent, getting near Captain Veleth will make him apologize for bothering you once again and tell you that the Second Councilor of Raven Rock, Adril Arano, wants to speak with you as soon as possible. He then makes it quite clear how important this task is, and when you locate Arano he will wait for you at a secure location, specifically on the road leading to the Earth Stone. An undercover meeting When you talk to him he will get right to the point: ""After everything you've already done for Raven Rock, I hate to ask for more but I can't risk Councilor Morvayn being killed."" He will then elaborate: ""The Ulen Family of House Hlaalu, a rival Great House, has placed a deathmark on the councilor's head."" He then explains that Councilor Morvayn once ordered a member of House Hlaalu executed and that he suspects that there are hostile members of House Hlaalu living undercover in Raven Rock, but only that he has his suspicions and nothing else to go on. He then asks you to be his eyes and ears in Raven Rock and see what you can discover. He suggests you talk to local innkeeper of the Retching Netch, a Dunmer by the name of Geldis Sadri who has quite the reputation as a gossip. When you bid Arano farewell, he will mention that Geldis has been with 'us' for a long time, so you can trust him—despite his reputation. From his spot behind the bar in the Retching Netch, Geldis will reveal that Arano has chased the Ulens for years, without any results whatsoever. He will then share his personal thoughts on what needs to be done: ""If you want to catch those slippery slaughterfish, you need to let them come to you. There's an Ulen Ancestral Tomb near the Temple. Someone's been leaving ash yam offerings on the altar inside."" Geldis reasons that whoever leaves ash yams in the tomb is bound to know something useful, though Arano and his team of Redoran Guards never had any luck when investigating the tomb. He then suggests that you, as an ordinary citizen, may have an advantage, and that you go to the tomb and wait around for that person to show up. An Unexpected Visitor[edit] The Ulen Ancestral Tomb will be empty when you enter. Wait around for a bit and a visitor will show up and silently pay her respects near the central grave. If you sneak up close enough to the visitor, the quest log will update and tell you to report back to Arano. When you approach her openly, she will turn around and reveal herself to be Tilisu Severin, saying: ""Oh, excuse me! I didn't realize there was anyone else here."" Ask her what she is doing there and she will answer: ""I presume the same thing you're doing... leaving an offering for the departed."" When you confront her with the fact that she is not a member of the Ulen family, she will brush you off with: ""Since there aren't any Ulens left on this island, I've taken it upon myself to leave the traditional offering in their stead."" You can choose between three options as part of your investigation: Who puts ash yam in the tomb? You're lying. You're from House Hlaalu! ""What kind of nonsense is that!? I'm simply honoring a fellow departed Dunmer, and you hurl baseless accusations at me?"" Tell me why you're really here.  ""I'm simply honoring a fellow departed Dunmer."" I'll let you get to it then. ""Oh, no bother. We all have a right to be here."" While Tilisu Severin returns to her meditation, locate Adril Arano and tell him that Tilisu may be the culprit: ""Tilisu? Are you sure?"" He will then ask you for evidence: ""If Tilisu's involved in any sort of plot to harm Councilor Morvayn, I'm going to need hard evidence to prove it."" He will, however, refuse to search Severin Manor himself and will then ask you to do it: ""If you're wrong about Tilisu, things would quickly go downhill around here and the real culprits might slip away. I can't afford for that to happen."" He'll then hand you the key to Severin Manor and give you free hands to find evidence by any means necessary: ""If you have the evidence and it places your life in peril, I would expect you to do whatever you must to keep yourself alive. Here, this key should open the front door of the manor in case they've locked it. Good luck."" If you ask Adril to tell you more about the Severin family, he responds, ""Tilisu is wife to the family patriarch, Vendil. They have a single child, a daughter named Mirri. They arrived here ten years ago, and have been nothing but a benefit to Raven Rock ever since."" Adril goes on to say, ""They're quite wealthy and they've been quite generous by sharing their fortune with the community. They've contributed coin, food, supplies... even helped repair a few of the buildings in town with their own hands."" When you ask if there's anything unusual about them at all, Adril reveals that "" People have mentioned it's a bit odd about how close in age Mirri appears to be to her father, but that's hardly a cause for alarm."" He concludes with a reminder: ""Just make sure that you find solid evidence. If I accuse them without it, I'll be the laughingstock of the colony."" The Ulen Matter[edit] The wealthiest family in Raven Rock Severin Manor is located in the western part of town, on the way to the Earth Stone. There are two ways of dealing with the next task; either go into sneak mode just prior to entering, or kick the door open. Regardless of the hour, Tilisu and Mirri Severin will be waiting inside with weapons drawn. Your target is the expert-locked safe downstairs, so either fight and kill them both to claim the key to the safe, or attempt to sneak down the stairs straight in front of you upon entering, without being detected. A potion which fortifies Sneak may help here before heading down, and there's one down the stairs to the right of the alchemy table on the shelf for the return trip. Head to the western bedroom and look for the Severin Family Safe that sits near a set of shelves to the left of the bed and either pick or unlock it. Inside is the revealing evidence, specifically The Ulen Matter, a letter written by family patriarch Vendil Severin, but signed by 'Vendil Ulen'. The letter clearly confirms Arano's suspicions, as it describes the plan to assassinate Councilor Lleril Morvayn as an act of revenge for the execution he ordered on a member of the Ulen family years back. Return to Arano with the letter in hand, and tell him that the Severin family is behind the conspiracy: ""Then we finally have them! All that remains now is chasing them down, and bringing them to justice."" Judged from the hostility you encountered back in the mansion, telling Arano you doubt they will surrender easily will make him send some help to Ashfallow Citadel, a place mentioned in the letter: ""I'm going to send two of the best Redoran Guard we have to take them down. I want you to assist them any way you can."" Although you will be given two options, Arano will not take no for an answer, so you will have to travel to the fort and help the guards out. Ashfallow Citadel[edit] The family patriarch According to Arano, Ashfallow Citadel has been abandoned for a long time, but when you arrive at the scene you will find the two Redoran Guards dead and be attacked by two Morag Tong assassins immediately. Dispose of them and enter the half-buried ruin. The interior is almost entirely covered in ash and the very first chamber hides an East Empire Company strongbox on some shelves. Kill the patrolling assassin and proceed down the spiral staircase. Loot the chest here, and find the narrow tunnel leading south. Before long, you will land in the private quarters, patrolled by two assassins. The path ahead is blocked by a set of metal bars. A bookshelf in the western room contains a safe with especially valuable loot. The eastern room contains an arcane enchanter and an alchemy lab, as well as a chain you need to pull to proceed. If you didn't kill her earlier, Mirri Severin will be waiting for you along with several assassins, so fight them all and face two more sets of metal bars blocking the path. Head into the western room and jump over five bear traps, then pull the chain. The other chain is located right next to the metal bars. Once they are removed, a third set of metal bars will block your path and the hallway will be plastered with pressure plates triggering spiked walls. Head into the western room and avoid more traps, then pull the two chains in there. With the path clear, head into the final chamber where you will find Vendil Severin and, if you didn't kill her earlier, Tilisu, both of them clad in Morag Tong armor and accompanied by two assassins. Engage them and Vendil will shout: ""For Vilur Ulen! Long live House Hlaalu!"" When you've defeated him, he hints that he is Vilur's son with his last words, ""I join you in death, father..."" When all is said and done, loot Vendil's corpse for various goodies. Note that his chest key can't be used anywhere, but there is an unlocked chest at the back of the room. There is no quick escape route to Solstheim, so backtrack all the way to the entrance and return to Raven Rock. The Good News[edit] ""Adril... I haven't seen a smile on your face like that in a long time."" Back in Raven Rock, an excited Adril Arano will ask you if you tracked down Vendil. When you assure him that Vendil is no longer a threat, he will be relieved despite the two deceased guards who were slain by the Morag Tong: ""Damn it. I was hoping to protect our people by sending them, not end up with casualties. To think that Vendil would stoop so low as to hire those fetchers... I'm glad you killed him."" He will then ask you to follow him and rush back to Morvayn Manor to deliver the good news himself. Follow him inside and witness a brief conversation between the two councilors: Your reward Adril: ""Excuse me, Councilor Morvayn? I have some wonderful news."" Lleril: ""Adril... I haven't seen a smile on your face like that in a long time."" Adril: ""This visitor has single-handedly dealt with a threat that could have ended your life. Vendil, Tilisu and Mirri Severin weren't who they appeared to be. I'm afraid they were here to avenge Vilur Ulen's death."" Lleril: ""Vendil? But he's done so much for Raven Rock... how could this be possible?"" Adril: ""They did it to gain our confidence, councilor. They had us all fooled. I should have been more vigilant. I'm sorry."" Lleril: ""Don't say that. It's not your fault, old friend."" Councilor Morvayn will then ask you to step forward and receive his thanks: ""What you've done for me... for all of Raven Rock... goes far beyond what I would have expected from a traveler to our town. For this, you have my deepest gratitude."" He will then hand you the reward: ""Now. I'm certain Adril was prepared to reward you appropriately for everything you've done. However, since a bit of coin hardly seems like enough... I've decided to provide something more substantial. Since the Severin family... or whoever they were...turned out to be criminals, their property is now forfeit. As Councilor, I hereby award you Severin Manor and everything contained within. You've earned your citizenship here, and I hope you'll consider staying with us as a member of our community."" He will also hand you a leveled amount of gold, along with the right to live inside Severin Manor and claim all its contents. This unlocks an achievement and ends the quest.

It recounts that when they took the fortress, the defenders had collapsed the entry and all killed themselves, leaving the ghosts to haunt the place. The well was locked and poisoned, and with the losses suffered from the poisoned water, Skorm decided not to search for the key in the crypts, simply choosing to leave the survivors sealed within. Forelhost Crypt[edit] Once in the crypt, make your way to the well. If you can pick the lock, do so, and move on down; otherwise turn right instead and head through the crypt tunnels to the far end, where you'll find the key. Then head back to the well. After going down the well, follow the tunnels on to the Refectory. You will find a potion on top of a stand with dart holes behind it - you can drop a wooden plate or something similar on the ground, pick up the potion, and use the plate/object to stop the darts. Forelhost Refectory[edit] Once in the Refectory, move through and find the glass dragon claw, which you'll need to open the puzzle door later. Continue on to the door. From top (outer ring) to bottom (inner ring), the solution is: Fox—Owl—Snake. You'll need to defeat the dragon priest Rahgot and four leveled draugr. Afterwards, loot Rahgot's body. He'll have the mask, a dragon priest staff, and the key to the battlements. Battlements[edit] Head out onto the battlements to reach a word wall, and learn a word for the Storm Call shout. After visiting the word wall move near the inside of the battlements; you'll see Captain Valmir talking to an enemy soldier. The objective to return to Valmir remains, so drop down. You'll find that Valmir has now dressed in the armor of the opposing side, to convince this other soldier to do the same job he sent you to do! He's an impostor! Defeat both Valmir and the enemy soldier to conclude the quest. If you wish, loot Valmir's Orders to discover that he was actually an agent (strongly implied, but not explicitly stated, to be Thalmor) who was sent to retrieve the mask and return to Labyrinthian with it (presumably to use the mask on the matching pedestal in Bromjunaar Sanctuary)."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Silence_Has_Been_Broken","Meet Amaund Motierre inside Volunruud. Take his letter and amulet to Astrid. Take the amulet to Delvin Mallory. Return to Astrid with the letter of credit.","The Prodigal Returns[edit] When you last left the Dark Brotherhood sanctuary, Astrid was still in turmoil regarding your sudden promotion to Listener, and the ensuing duties the role required. Once you have fulfilled any of the contracts Nazir gave you after completing Whispers in the Dark (Narfi, Beitild, Ennodius Papius, Hern, Lurbuk), go back to the sanctuary. Astrid will approach you and tell you that she has finished thinking. She agrees that it would be madness to just ignore the Night Mother's demands and tells you to travel to Volunruud to meet with Amaund Motierre. The Stars Aligned[edit] When you enter Volunruud, a skeleton sits in a small alcove immediately to your left. It will attack you as you pass, so conduct a preemptive strike while it slumbers, or sneak past it. Near the skeleton are Heddic's Volunruud notes; reading them will start Volunruud's dungeon quest. Completing the quest gives you a word of Aura Whisper, a useful shout for assassins, but the quest is not necessary to meet Motierre. After the skeleton, the first room is straight ahead. There are three paths, but the one you want is the leftmost one. Open the door and you'll find the client waiting with Rexus, his bodyguard. Motierre will be impressed and a bit unnerved that you have arrived. He informs you that he has multiple targets in mind, all culminating in a shocking end--the assassination of the Emperor. The bodyguard will then give you two items: a valuable jeweled amulet ""to cover expenses"" and a sealed letter with further instructions to deliver to Astrid. Return to the sanctuary and deliver these items to Astrid. Back at the Sanctuary[edit] When you return, Astrid is anxious to know the goings-on. When you tell her of Motierre's grand design, she will be excited by the prospect of such glory for the Brotherhood and starts with preparations.  She wants to study the letter further, but in the meantime, asks you to take the amulet to Delvin Mallory, a Thieves Guild member located at the Ragged Flagon in the Ratway in Riften. She wants the amulet appraised and sold, if Mallory is interested. The Wheels in Motion[edit] Upon inspecting the amulet, Mallory will inform you that it is a one-of-a-kind item and is only given to members of the Elder Council. He agrees to purchase it and hands you a letter of credit, which is to be delivered to Astrid—as per their ""standard arrangement"". Return to Astrid with the letter. When you explain what Mallory told you about the amulet she will be delighted, musing that Motierre is probably a member of the Elder Council looking to get himself promoted. With that, she is all smiles and action; she informs you that the first step to completing the new directive will be for you to attend a wedding and assassinate the bride."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Silenced_Tongues","Travel to Volunruud. Read Heddic's Volunruud Notes. Locate the ceremonial weapons. Open the Elder's Cairn. Defeat Kvenel.","Getting the Quest[edit] Immediately inside the entrance to your left is a skeleton sitting on a throne that will come alive and attack you if given the chance. After killing him, look down to find Heddic's Volunruud Notes and what appears to be Heddic's skeleton. Reading the book begins the quest, as does attempting to open the puzzle door further on. Finding the Weapons[edit] The next room is a hub chamber with 4 passages radiating off in different directions. The northern passage, up a short flight of stairs, leads to the puzzle door and the final chamber. However, you will need to collect two ceremonial weapons, an axe and a sword, before heading for the puzzle door. Head through the southwest passage to find a chest and some loot. There's nothing else here (unless you are on the quest The Silence Has Been Broken), so head back to the hub chamber. Move through the northwest door. The first and second bends have undead sleeping in the walls, and there are two more waiting around the next corner. Continue down through the cave and through the next set of iron doors to find the next objective, guarded by an undead boss with one or two draugr to help him. Take them out while being careful of the floor traps scattered between them and you. The ceremonial axe you need is on a display plaque on the wall above and behind the throne. There is also the One-handed skill book Mace Etiquette to the right, on the arm of the throne. Now, head back to the hub chamber. Go through the northeast passage. The first room has two levels and a high bridge above it all. There will be several more undead waiting for you on the balcony across from the one you are on when you enter the room. Kill the ones you can see across from you with a bow or ranged spells, then head down the log ramp and past the swinging spike trap. At the next fork, the northerly passage on your left leads to the balcony across from the one where you entered the last room, so if you wish to loot the draugr you range-killed as you entered, this is the best time to do so. Return to the fork and take the southeasterly branch, which spirals up to the high bridge you saw in the first room along this branch. Immediately after crossing the high bridge, you will arrive at a small chamber with a little altar amid numerous candles. Enter cautiously because there is an undead awaiting your arrival, out of your line of sight in a wall-crypt to your immediate right as you enter. Continue through the iron door and to your second objective, the ceremonial sword. As you approach the central coffin, two undeads will pop out of the wall-crypts flanking you and attack. After defeating them, take the ceremonial sword from the skeleton in the central coffin and head back the way you came, to the hub chamber. Now, with both ceremonial weapons in your inventory, head up the short flight of stairs into the northern passage and activate the iron doors to Elder's Cairn. The two ceremonial weapons will be removed from your inventory and be placed into their respective receptacles in the doors. Activate the doors again to enter Elder's Cairn. A short distance down this path is a small area with a burnt corpse and some minor loot. Just beyond that is a draugr guarding a large spider web, and then the final chamber, which contains The Tongue Chieftain Kvenel himself, along with an undead conjurer. Fighting Kvenel[edit] Kvenel is a bluish, ghostly form seated on a throne on the far side of the room, and his conjurer is a draugr to the right (southwest) of Kvenel. The easiest way to defeat Kvenel and his minion (if you have decent Archery skills and enchantments, a powerful bow or crossbow and the Deadly Aim perk from the Sneak skill tree) is to sneak carefully into the room until you have a clear shot at Kvenel as he sits on his throne and shoot him dead with a triple-damage sneak shot with your bow. If your first shot doesn't kill him, you should have time for a second shot as he tries to rise from his throne. Meanwhile, instead of summoning an atronach or attacking you, his conjurer minion conveniently comes over to stand in front of the throne to see what is troubling the now-dead Kvenel, so you won't even have to re-aim your bow to take out the minion. If you are not able, or inclined, to take out Kvenel and his minion from the entrance of the chamber, you will have a semi-difficult fight on your hands. Kvenel himself uses two ice-enchanted melee weapons, while his conjurer minion is a draugr who summons atronachs and casts ranged frost spells to slow you down. Because he casts ranged ice and frost spells and summons atronachs, it is advisable to take out the conjurer first. Alternatively, you could try to draw Kvenel into another room to kill him first, then go back to the throne room to handle the conjurer. The conjurer will summon a Frost Atronach when he sees you. He also uses ice magic to slow you down, making running away or closing the initial gap difficult for melee fighters. You can use the pillars on the northeastern side of the chamber (your left as you enter) to your advantage by using them to block the ice spells as well as blocking his line of sight and regaining stealth. For melee characters, Whirlwind Sprint and plenty of stamina are helpful. Once the conjurer is dead, Kvenel is relatively simple to defeat using any attacks you like and dodging to stay out of his melee range whenever possible. Blocking is also helpful here. Among his ghostly remains is his enchanted sword, Eduj. Due to a bug, you may have to activate his remains again to obtain Okin, the enchanted axe. If it is not listed as loot on his corpse, you may also be able to find it on the ground near his remains. To the right of the throne is a chest with leveled loot and around the stone platform are various potions. Exit the room through the southwest passage where you will find a word wall with a word of the Aura Whisper shout. Up the stairs will be the bridge you passed under on your way into the boss chamber along with any draugr you didn't snipe on your way in. Across the bridge, you will find a final chest of leveled loot along with a Dragon Priest Dagger and a reference book about Labyrinthian on the floor. As you return to the bridge, look to your hard right to find a chest on a ledge in the shadows. You can reach it by jumping to the tree roots and then jumping again over to the chest, or by using Whirlwind Sprint. Drop down and head south to find the exit."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Silver_Hand","Talk to Skjor. Meet with Skjor at night. Enter the Underforge. Participate in the blood ritual. Talk to Aela the Huntress. Kill the werewolf hunters.","A Secret Meeting[edit] After completing another set of radiant quests, the usual job providers will once again point you towards Skjor. Aela will say:  ""Still eager to please. This is good. Skjor may be right about you. He has something special planned for you. Better talk to him."", while Farkas will say: ""Skjor was looking for you before. Talk to him before doing anything else."" Skjor turns out to be less talkative than usual and will request a meeting after dark near the Underforge, a secret crypt underneath the smithy of Eorlund Gray-Mane. At night, Skjor will wait for you near the secret entrance, determined to make you a stronger member of the Companions. He will then open the secret entrance and encourage you to follow. Inside the Underforge, you will encounter Aela the Huntress in her lycanthropic form, standing next to an empty fountain. Skjor will introduce her as your 'forebear', and will inform you that this is to be kept secret from Harbinger Kodlak Whitemane, and will then ask if you are prepared. When you are ready, Skjor will cut open Aela's wrist, filling the fountain with her blood. Activate the fountain and receive the Beast Form power, which causes you to black out. Rampage[edit] You wake up outside the Underforge, now as a werewolf, where you will find all of Whiterun's residents are now hostile to you. If you head into the streets, citizens will flee and guards will attack you, leaving you no choice but to avoid them or kill them. Due to your beastly appearance, you will not gain a bounty for assaulting anyone. After a certain amount of time, you will black out once again. The easiest way to avoid unwanted casualties is to simply wait a while after exiting the Underforge, as this causes your werewolf bloodlust to wear off, and the next scene to continue. Another option is to go back into the Underforge as soon as you've transformed, and use the secret exit that leads you out of the city. You can also simply avoid any attackers if you do not wish to kill any people in the city, you'll black out regardless of whether you killed anyone or not. The Silver Hand[edit] This time, you wake up in the middle of nowhere, with a concerned Aela looking over you. Your gear has been unequipped, but you haven't lost anything; simply re-equip to prepare for battle. Aela will congratulate you on surviving the initiation and inform you that the Silver Hand, a group of werewolf hunters, have inhabited Gallows Rock and will not hide the fact that they should be slaughtered right away. She also informs you that Skjor already entered the fort. From this point, Aela will act as your follower, dismissing your current follower if you have one. Head west towards the fort. A number of Silver Hand members will guard the exterior area, so dispose of them and enter the fort. Gallows Rock[edit] Aela fighting Krev the Skinner ""The bastards... somehow they managed to kill Skjor."" The first room is a sealed-off area, so pull the chain next to the severed werewolf head and proceed forward. The fort is buzzing with enemies and werewolves in cages, both living and dead, all seemingly exposed to torture by their captors. Be on the lookout for the One-handed skill book The Importance of Where in the huge southern chamber, the Smithing skill book The Last Scabbard of Akrash near the workbench, as well as several locked and unlocked chests. Aela will comment on the first dead werewolf you find, which is found next to a set of rare Torture Tools. When you reach the northwestern chamber, Aela will rightfully warn you about Silver Hand leader Krev the Skinner, so be prepared. When the chamber is cleared, a worried Aela will run up onto the podium and discover the dead body of Skjor, obviously killed due to his lycanthropy. Once you speak with her, the quest will end and you will have to find your own way out, through the door to the northeast that was previously barred. Three new radiant quests are now available back in Jorrvaskr and you will have to complete two of them (for Aela) before you can access the next major quest. However, if a certain amount of time has passed, you may only have to do one radiant quest to begin  Blood's Honor.[verification needed — see talk page]  Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked once you speak with Aela after surviving the initiation: Blood Oath (10 points/Bronze) — Become a member of the Circle"

Make your way to the Bandit's Sanctuary and take the key from Rigel Strong-Arm. Open the room and take the silver mold. Return the mold to Endon.","A Special Job[edit] Once you've completed five additional jobs in the city of Markarth, speak to Delvin at the Ragged Flagon to receive a 'special job'. Delvin explains that he has received word from Endon in Markarth of a special request. Travel to Markarth and speak to Endon, who will be in the Silver-Blood Inn for this quest. He will explain that he wants you to recover a silver mold he ordered, which was stolen by bandits in transit. ""The only thing I can tell you is that the mold was taken to the bandit's hideout... a small cottage called Pinewatch."" If you've already been to Pinewatch and have the mold, he will take it and the quest will be completed. A Hidden Entrance[edit] When you enter Pinewatch, a man named Rhorlak may engage you in conversation. You can bribe him into revealing the location of the bandit's hideout, which is opened by a button next to the bookcase in the basement. The button opens a hidden entrance that leads down to some caves. There are three bandits here who can all be avoided by dropping to the lower area and carefully making your way around the back and back up the planks. The exit will be on your left if you fight across the bridge (and therefore on your right if you sneak up from behind via the lower level). The three bandits in the next room are harder to avoid, but this can be done with some careful timing. There is one more bandit in front of the door to Pinewatch Bandit's Sanctuary; this last one is nearly impossible to avoid because of the light sources in the tunnel. If you prefer to fight through this whole section, there is no reason to leave any of the bandits alive. After entering the next section, you'll find several bandits conversing around a table, but they can be avoided by sneaking around the clutter to the left and carefully making your way up the path to the right. The next bandit can be avoided by staying in the shadows. Soon you will come to a dark room with several dead draugr, patrolled by another lone bandit. There is a treasure room to the right which contains an unusual gem and various other valuables, along with a booby-trapped novice-level chest. Past the draugr room is a living area, with a shared bedroom separated by a wooden partition from a bar, where several bandits will discuss their leader's obsession with protecting her treasure. It is very difficult to sneak past all of these bandits, due mainly to the firelight and the directions the bandits face. With a high Sneak skill you can sneak past by hugging the left wall, or you can use a short duration invisibility effect and sneak straight through the middle of the room (even eating vampire dust may work with the right timing). Every Cloud...[edit] Next is Rigel Strong-Arm's room. She alternates between sitting at the table, patrolling the next tunnel, and sleeping. The first part contains six bone rattles, a workbench, and a potion on the shelves. Her bedroom contains a potion on the dresser, a leveled weapon propped against an apprentice-locked chest, and a leveled soul gem on the bedside table. Rigel carries the Pinewatch Treasure Room Key, and you do not need to kill her to complete the quest. Rigel has taken a few precautions and set up some traps to stop anyone from getting to her treasure. The room after the next tunnel contains a bone rattle and a master-locked door, which can also be unlocked by the treasure room key. There is a pressure plate before the bridge, which activates darts from both sides. At the start of the next tunnel is another pressure plate that activates blades in front of you, and another plate at the far end that activates a battering ram from the right. After that is a metal pressure plate that activates a mace from the right. Opening the final door before the treasure room activates another mace, while the final trap is a metal pressure plate which activates darts from the walls and ceiling. Your patience and fortitude is rewarded by a random and leveled assortment of potions, ore, ingots, coin purses, loose coins, and enchanted armor, and of course the silver mold. There is also a leveled chest beside the exit door, which opens to behind the barred door in the first section of the caves. If you left the bandits alive, you can again drop to the lower level and sneak back to the house area of Pinewatch. ...has a Silver Lining[edit] Return to Endon and give him the mold, and he will reward you with an enchanted piece of armor, and offer his services as a fence. Report back to Delvin. He'll compliment you on your success, ""I hear Endon's quite pleased to have his merchandise back. He's a powerful ally in Markarth. Should help the Guild regain a foothold in the west."" He will also inform you of a new merchant setting up shop in the Ragged Flagon."

Return to Morwen.","If you return to Skaal Village after the quest The Fate of the Skaal, you may find Morwen working near the forge. She may tell you, ""My mother was Skaal, but she left the village and I was born in Skyrim."" If you ask her why her mother left the village, she will tell you the whole story of her family. A trade ship from Skyrim struck ice off the coast near the village, and the Skaal took in the surviving sailors. Her mother, Bera, fell in love with one of the sailors—her father, Ulfarr—and eventually returned with him to Skyrim. However, Bera never returned to the village and died in Falkreath, where little Morwen was born. If you are willing to give Morwen a hand, she will tell you that she came across a few of her mother's old things not long ago and among them was a necklace that her father gave to her mother when they were married. She believes it would be meaningful to place it upon her tombstone in Falkreath, as a symbol of her undying love and the great sacrifice she made for it. She wants you to deliver her mother's necklace to the priest Runil. After the conversation, Bera's necklace will be added into your inventory. If you haven't talked to Gjalund Salt-Sage about the passage back to Skyrim, a quest marker will appear at his location. Travel to Falkreath and you may find Runil in Falkreath's Hall of the Dead. Talk to him about the request of Morwen of Skaal Village; he will recall the name. ""I knew her parents quite well, you know. Bera and Ulfarr were good people, very much in love."" Then he will be willing to grant her request. ""Bera's silver necklace. It was a wedding gift and she rarely took it off. I'll be glad to oblige. What a touching gesture, to display the symbol of her devotion in such a way."" He is sure it will bring joy to her parents as they walk in Aetherius. Then he will take the necklace from your inventory. Return to Morwen in Skaal Village, and she will be grateful. ""You've brought warmth to my heart, outsider, and I'm in your debt."" Then she will reward you with a Nordic carved helmet and regard you as an ally to the Skaal. She will also become a potential spouse."

Along the city wall of the Plains District, the Imperial Legion will be returning fire with their own catapults. The streets will be busy with citizens running back to their houses and city guards making ready to fight the enemy. Whiterun will suffer great destruction during the battle. Severio Pelagia will be killed and his home, as well as Heimskr's, will be destroyed. The Bleeding Battlefield[edit] Just outside the city gates, you will find Legate Rikke on the strategically important main entryway, busy addressing a crowd of fully-armed Imperial Soldiers: ""This is it men! This is an important day for the Empire and for the Legion. And for all of Skyrim. This is the day we send a message to Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebel Jarls who support him. But make no mistake.

For the Legion! Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!"" Soon after Rikke finishes her speech, the Stormcloaks will start their attack. Their archers will provide suppression fire from a distance outside the gate, while the main force will move up the main road in groups. First, you need to defend the barricades, then the drawbridge. Finally, you need to kill attacking soldiers until the percentage of attackers remaining drops to zero. Legate Rikke and Hadvar, both of whom are essential and cannot be killed, will give you a hand during the defense, so stay close to one or both of them if you are having difficulty. The united force of Whiterun guards and Imperial soldiers will take advantage of the fortifications and draw the attention of many enemies. Don't worry if you are unable to defend the barricades or drawbridge. It does not affect the ending of the quest or your reward.

The citizens of Whiterun are forever in your debt! But Ulfric will not stop here. No, he will continue to strike out against any true Nord who remains faithful to the Empire. He will continue to sow discord and chaos wherever he can. And so, we must each one of us, continue to fight this insurrection, lest our fallen brothers have died for naught! Lest our honor be lessened should we allow these bloodthirsty beasts to prowl our lands! Carry on men, my gratitude and blessings go with you! For Whiterun! For the Empire!""

If you die, then I'll have no further use for your corpse."" She will then explain that the Legion will set up a garrison at Fort Hraggstad but that the place has been overrun with bandits and needs to be cleared.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:MQ201RecoverGearMISC","Talk to Delphine in Riverwood. Meet Malborn in Solitude and give him any equipment you want smuggled into the embassy. Meet Delphine at the stables, wear the party clothes and hop in the carriage for a ride to the embassy. At the embassy, create a diversion and slip away from the party with Malborn. Recover Thalmor intelligence files from the ambassador's office. Go down to the dungeon and recover the rest of the documents. Obtain the key to the trapdoor and escape.","Diplomatic Immunity[edit] The Thalmor[edit] Malborn inside the Winking Skeever Travel to Riverwood. If you choose to travel with Delphine, and come close to her, she will stop and explain the complex background story about the Blades and how the Aldmeri Dominion wiped out all Blades during the Great War. While her memory of past events seems checkered at best, she at least provides some background information behind her hatred towards the Thalmor and a valid reason on why she suspects them for being responsible for the dragon attacks. Due to a travel bug, it is best to chat with Delphine at the beginning of her trip, then stop by the Braidwood Inn and rest, giving her time to travel alone. She has no special commentary at waypoints in this direction. Delphine will appear at The Bannered Mare in Whiterun and fuss at the Dragonborn for not meeting her in Riverwood. Once back in the Sleeping Giant Inn, she will head down to the secret basement and reveal that she has a plan. Delphine's dialogue Delphine: ""I figured out how we're going to get you into the Thalmor Embassy.""  You're not coming? That didn't take long. Why not just fight our way in? Thalmor Ambassador Elenwen often throws parties for the upper-class citizens of Skyrim. You are to meet a ""man on the inside"", Malborn, who will help you to the best of his abilities. He will meet you at the Winking Skeever in Solitude. In the meantime, Delphine will work on getting you a formal invitation to the party. Travel to Solitude and see Malborn. The Wood Elf[edit] According to Delphine, the Thalmor killed Malborn's entire family back in Valenwood, giving him plenty of good reason to help you out. You will find him inside the Winking Skeever, trying to keep a low profile. He will be quite surprised that she picked you for such a dangerous infiltration job, but will explain the situation. You are to carefully choose some equipment that he can smuggle into the embassy, preferably stealth-based, and he advises you not to try to bring anything yourself. When you're ready, hand him your preferred equipment. Don't forget to give him lockpicks if you want to access locked containers in the Embassy. After you close the menu, he will get up and leave. Delphine will now be waiting for you at Solitude Stables, just southwest of Solitude. Once you arrive, she will ensure that everything went smoothly with Malborn and will then hand you an official invitation along with a set of party clothes and boots to look the part. After you have changed she will take your remaining equipment and you will automatically board the carriage to the Thalmor Embassy. High-Class Party[edit] The Thalmor Embassy ""I am Elenwen, the Thalmor Ambassador to Skyrim."" The carriage driver will drop you off in the courtyard of the embassy and you will be greeted by the drunken ramblings of a Redguard named Razelan, apparently a high-ranking officer in the East Empire Company. As you approach the entrance, a Thalmor Soldier will ask for your invitation, so show it and go inside. Once you enter, party host Elenwen will be quick to seek you out and ask too many questions. Luckily, your friend Malborn is standing right behind her and will soon interrupt the embarrassing conversation and point Elenwen's attention elsewhere. Talk to Malborn, who will brief you; you are to create a scene so he can unlock the back door unnoticed. Look around the room and check out the guests. When asking around, you will quickly notice that the guests are either hateful Thalmor or high-ranked denizens of Skyrim who only participate in the party for personal benefit. With the exception of the hostess Elenwen, the drunken Razelan, the servant Brelas and the bard Illdi (or Grete if Illdi is dead ), the guests are often randomized or determined from your previous actions before even starting the quest. You can quickly create the distraction by talking to Erikur. Listen to his speech, then wait for him to harass Brelas. After he is finished, walk back to him and offer to talk to her in his stead. He will be very grateful. Regardless of what you say to Brelas, when you return to Erikur tell him, ""Yes. She said she can sneak you up to her quarters right now"". He will then immediately go to her and begin to accost her, drawing the attention of the guards. Quickly return to Malborn and proceed to the kitchen. There are no persuasion checks required for this and his disposition towards you does not affect the dialogue.  Brelas will later end up in a dungeon cell, but can be liberated. Alternatively, giving a bottle of Cyrodilic Brandy (which you can obtain from Malborn) to Razelan, whom you previously met outside, will make him inclined to create a disruption on your behalf if you request it of him.   Party Conversations In this randomly determined conversation, Elenwen will politely ask the guests if they're liking the party. Depending if they're happy or not, their answer will vary:    Order  Speaker  Line   #1  Elenwen  ""Are you enjoying the party?""   ""Is the food and drink to your liking?""   ""Is my staff seeing to your needs?""   #2  (in the faction MQ201PartyGuestHappy)Orthus EndarioProventus AvenicciSiddgeirMaven Black-BriarErikur Elisif the Fair  ""Everything is splendid, thank you.""   ""Very much so, and thank you for asking.""   (in the faction MQ201PartyGuestUnhappy)Aquillius AeresiusRazelanBalgruuf the GreaterIdgrod RavencroneIgmundGeneral TulliusVittoria Vici  ""As much as can be expected, yes.""   ""I have no complaints.""   ""I suppose so, yes.""   #3  Elenwen  ""Splendid. Call if you have need of me.""   ""It pleases me to hear you say so.""   ""Excellent. I'll leave you to it, then.""  The Jarls aligned with the Empire may also talk about problems running their hold due to recent events. They can either be Idgrod Ravencrone, Balgruuf the Greater, Siddgeir, Igmund, or Elisif the Fair. Again, they will choose between random lines:    Speaker  Line   Jarl#1  ""We've got our hands full dealing with the Stormcloaks. What about you?""   ""Are the dragons frightening your people as much as they're frightening mine?""   ""Have you found it difficult to get provisions lately? I can scarcely feed the staff in my palace.""   ""Between the dragons and the Stormcloaks, my coffers are running dry.""   Jarl#2  ""We've had the same troubles.""   ""I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.""   Jarl#1  ""With any luck, a worthy hero will step forward and solve our problems, just like in the tales of old.""   ""We must keep faith in ourselves and the Divines.""   ""These are troubling times, indeed.""  In yet another conversation, the party guests (except Ondolemar) will discuss current events:    Speaker  Line   Guest#1  ""I heard Elenwen say she's going open a bottle of her best Firebrand Wine later. I can hardly wait.""   ""These Stormcloaks are nothing more than an armed mob. This war won't last much longer.""   ""I hope they'll serve the roast venison with bittergreen sauce that we had at the last party. That was delicious.""   ""This war has taken a toll on the merchants of Skyrim. Let's hope that it ends soon, for their sake.""   ""I look forward to the day when this rebellion is put down, and we once again have peace.""   ""The Gray Quarter in Windhelm is little better than a slum. It's shameful that the dark elves are made to live that way.""   ""With the soldiers all fighting in the war, there's nobody to hunt down the bandits. Travel has become dangerous of late.""   ""It's been a brutal winter. I can't remember the last time it was this cold, and for this long.""   Guest#2  ""Yes, I agree with you. Have you heard any news from the other parts of Skyrim?""   ""You speak truly. Have you heard any interesting rumors of late?""   ""I'll not argue that. Heard any interesting gossip lately?""   ""I couldn't agree more. By the way, have you heard any interesting rumors lately?""   ""I couldn't have said it better myself. It's been some time since I've had news from elsewhere in Skyrim. What have you heard?""   ""I know just what you mean. Heard anything interesting lately? Any news or gossip?""   Guest#1  ""Well, I did hear that the Argonians have been banned from living inside the walls of Windhelm. They're only allowed on the city docks now. Most of them sleep together in one building, and they're as poor as wretches.""   ""Have you visited Rorikstead lately? No matter how harsh the winter, the crops that grow there never falter. Even when every other farm in the hold is barely scraping by, the harvest at Rorikstead is always bountiful. Is it good fortune? The blessings of the Divines? Who knows?""   ""Now that I think on it, I did hear something rather interesting the other day. Apparently, the Red Wave has been docked in Solitude for well over a month, and with no sign of shipping out any time soon. Some say the ship suffered damage to her hull when she struck an iceberg, and Captain Safia can't afford the repairs. Of course, she would never admit such a thing. Captain Safia is far too proud a woman for that.   ""Well, there might be nothing to it, but I've heard that the feud between the Gray-Manes and the Battle-Borns in Whiterun has grown ugly. Fralia Gray-Mane is convinced that the Battle-Borns have abducted one of her sons.""   ""I'm not sure that it's news, but lately it seems like every blacksmith in Skyrim is out to prove that he's the equal of Eorlund Gray-Mane. It's not really a fair comparison, if you ask me. After all, Eorlund works the Skyforge. How is any smith going to compete with that?""   ""Well, I did see something interesting not long ago. There were several Khajiit camped outside the walls of Whiterun. Seems they've been traveling around the whole of Skyrim peddling their wares. You've got to admire their courage, doing something like that with dragons on the loose and a war going on.""   ""I heard those mages up in Winterhold have been trying to figure out how many dragons there are in Skyrim. They seem to think it's at least a dozen, but I'm sure they're exaggerating. They're probably trying to scare us into giving them more money and influence, so they can save us from the dragons threat.""   ""Well, I did hear that Ulfric Stormcloak was slain while defending Windhelm against a dragon, but it sounds too good to be true. I'll wager it was Ulfric himself that started the rumor. Maybe he thought it would bolster recruitment."" (only heard if Ulfric is alive)   Ondelmar  ""The degeneracy of the Empire is on display here in this room.""   ""It's only a matter of time before your whole rotten Empire collapses of its own decay. No offense.""   ""None of these people cares a whit about the religious aspects of this war. Another sign of the degeneracy of your Empire.""   ""At least Ulfric's men are willing to fight for their principles, barbaric as they may be.""   ""It's a necessary part of my job to mix with the upper classes of Skyrim, such as they are.""

You behave like you're carousing in a house of ill repute, not the residence of the Thalmor Ambassador! Elenwen: Razelan.  And you promised to behave yourself this time.  Remove him.  He's disturbing the other guests. Razelan: I protest!  This is an insult to the dignity of my person!  This time I'm completely innocent! / This is preposterous.  Disrespect... insulting!

You there!  Serving girl!  What's your name, dear? Brelas: Uh, Brelas, sir.  Did you need a drink?  Something to eat? Erikur: No, no, that's not what I'm interested in right now.  I just wanted to get a better look at you.  I like what I see, my dear.  And believe me, I don't say that to everyone.  I'm very discriminating when it comes to the female form. Brelas: Um, thank you.  Sir.  Was there anything else I can do for you? Erikur: Oh... not at the moment.  Maybe later.  Don't go far. Brelas: Yes, sir.  At this point, you need to speak to Brelas, and then either lie to Erikur or tell him the truth.   Lie Truth    Erikur: Hello, my dear.  I got your message.  Where shall we go? Brelas: What?  I'm sorry, sir, but you must have misunderstood.  I'm not permitted to leave the party. Erikur: Oh, I don't think so.  I think I understand perfectly.  Don't worry, my dear, I will make any necessary excuses to your employer.    Erikur: So you think you can toy with me, is that it?  No, my dear.  I have my heart set on you, and I always get what I want. Brelas: I'm sorry, sir.  I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression earlier.  I meant no disrespect. Erikur: Don't worry, I'll let you make it up to me.  Now, where can we go for a little privacy, hmm?   Brelas: No, I'm sorry, but I can't go anywhere with you.  I won't.  Please, I must get back to my duties. Erikur: Don't you dare walk away from me, you slut!  Do you know who I am? Brelas: Please, sir, leave me alone! Erikur: Now you're going to be sorry you crossed me.  Elenwen!  This servant girl has been throwing herself at me in a most disgusting manner. Elenwen: Is that so, Erikur?  And you with such delicate sensibilities.  It must have been most upsetting. Erikur: I demand that you have this wench removed from my presence at once! Elenwen: Well.  Whatever the truth of it, I'm sure a few words with Master Rulindil will have a salutary effect.  Take her downstairs. Brelas: No! Guard: Yes, Madame Ambassador. Brelas: Mistress Elenwen, it's not true!  I did nothing!  Sir, you must tell her!  You don't know what they'll do to me!  Please! Erikur: Well, I'm glad that little unpleasantness is over.  Brelas will be found in the torture room downstairs.  You can rescue her, after which she will move to the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm. ""Helping"" Erikur in this way befriends him, whether you lie to him or tell the truth, even if you rescue Brelas from her cell later.

Infiltration[edit] In the kitchen, the Khajiit cook Tsavani will complain about Malborn bringing a stranger into the kitchens, at least until Malborn reminds her of her secret Moon Sugar addiction. Malborn will then lead you into a room where you can receive the items you asked him to smuggle in. You should now be fully prepared for battle, and if not, then for stealth. If you are not, it is probably a good idea to re-open an earlier save and re-start the mission, as the Thalmor Wizards summon hostile Storm Atronachs, and you should be prepared enough to kill their mages or them. As soon as you exit through the door, Malborn will lock the kitchen area behind you and you are on your own, with the objective to find dragon-related intelligence. In the first hallway, you can eavesdrop on a conversation between two Thalmor Guards, hinting that Delphine may be wrong about the Thalmor: Guard #1: ""Did you see those robes march in this morning? Who're they with? More of the Emissary's treaty enforcers?"" Guard #2: ""No. They're high mages, just in from Alinor. I guess Herself is finally getting worried about all the dragon attacks."" Guard #1: ""Ah, good. I've been wondering how we were supposed to defend this place from a dragon."" Guard #2: ""If a dragon does show up, maybe we'll get lucky and it will eat the mages first. Might give us enough time to kill it."" Guard #1: ""Ha. I'd like to see those arrogant bastards taken down a notch. Always looking down their noses at us lowly footsloggers."" After a bit of mean-spirited laughter, one of the guards will say, ""Well, we'd better get back to our rounds."" and they will both return to their duties, unfortunately in the room you will have to pass through. Note that the full set of Thalmor clothes in the adjacent room was supposed to make you harder to detect, but due to a bug, the clothes don't work, as the desired effect was wrongfully set to the Hooded Thalmor Robes. You can claim a set of hooded robes from the Thalmor wizard in the upstairs area from the first room, but chances are he will detect you and call upon the two guards from downstairs. Regardless, you can choose between two  strategies; either take the stealthy approach, with or without the hooded robes, or go on a rampage and kill everybody. Hooded Thalmor Robes Method[edit] If you want to use the Hooded Thalmor Robes, as intended by the developers, either acquire some from the random Justiciars found in the wilderness, or aim to kill the wizard on the first floor. After you don the robes, you will be undercover if you're an elf, can walk past the guards (at a distance) if you are human, or will be immediately exposed if you are Khajiit or Argonian. Table   Race  Response   High Elf  ""Must be new around here.""   Wood Elf  ""Seems a bit short to me.""   Imperial/Nord/Redguard/Breton/Dark Elf/Orc  ""You there. I don't think I've seen you around before."" or ""Come here. Let me see your face."" or ""Haven't seen him/her around before."" or ""Must be new around here.""   Beast Race (Khajiit/Argonian)  ""Wait, is that a tail?""  If disguised as a Thalmor Wizard, you may dismiss the guard standing outside the Solar with a high enough speech check (if you cannot pass the speech check however, he'll notice that you're an intruder and everybody in the courtyard will turn hostile). Note that once you reach Elenwen's Solar, the patrolling guard, as well as Rulindil, are scripted to see through your disguise, regardless of race. This method is possible with a reasonably high Illusion skill (over 50) as other races by using Calm spells. It does not work for any other guards during this mission, and once you are inside the Solar, the guards will attack you on sight.  Speech check dialogue Thalmor Wizard: ""Why aren't you at your post, Justiciar?""  Emissary Elenwen was asking for you inside. (Persuade) Yes sir. Sorry sir. If the speech check is passed, he will respond: Thalmor Wizard: ""Why didn't you say so? Take over my post. Make sure nobody enters the Solar. Enter the Solar[edit] The first room contains the two talkative guards, with the Thalmor wizard patrolling the second floor. Right after their conversation ends, they will both turn their back to the door and return to their positions, giving you a chance to sneak upstairs and attempt to claim the robes by killing the wizard quietly. If not, you will have to take out the two guards and the wizard, and pick one of the two available doors leading to the outside courtyard. The area is patrolled by three Thalmor soldiers with another wizard standing guard near the front door to your target destination, the Solar of Elenwen. If you wear the hooded robes, the guards will not notice you, but the wizard cannot generally be avoided and will see through your disguise. To enter the Solar, you have a few options. The most straightforward is to fight them all. You can avoid the fight by using Calm, or by using Fury on one of the guards and then running in while they're busy with each other. Stealthy characters can fire arrows to distract the guards and pull the wizard away from the door. The door wizard occasionally looks to his left, leaving open an opportunity on his right for sneaking and invisible characters to get through the door before fully detected. Once the guards are dealt with and the way to the Solar is clear, enter sneak mode and head in. The Informant[edit] Once you get inside Elenwen's Solar, the true face of the Thalmor will start to show, although not in the way Delphine expected. When the door closes behind you, you should hide behind the plant in the southwestern corner and eavesdrop on the conversation between the Thalmor torturer Rulindil and his informant Gissur in the neighboring room. The conversation centers on a prisoner named Etienne and an unnamed old man: ""He knows where that old man is you're looking for..."" Gissur: ""But, I need that money! I earned it. I have my own expenses you know..."" Rulindil: ""Silence! Do not presume, Gissur. You are most useful, but do not presume. We have other informants who are less... offensive."" Gissur: ""But no one else has brought you such valuable information, have they? Etienne, he's talked, hasn't he? He knows where that old man is you're looking for, he told me himself."" Rulindil: ""You'll get the rest of your money when we confirm his story. As agreed."" Gissur: ""So he has talked! I knew it!"" Rulindil: ""Everyone talks, in the end. Now, I have work to do. Leave me to it, if you ever want to see the rest of your payment."" Gissur: ""Can I... I could help you. He'd talk to me. He trusts me."" Rulindil: ""You'd like to come downstairs with me, is that it, Gissur? Shall we loose his bonds and put you in a cell together? You can ask him anything you like, and see how he answers."" Gissur: ""No, no. I'll... I'll wait outside."" Rulindil: ""That would probably be best. Now get out!"" While an insulted Gissur obeys orders and leaves the building, Rulindil will head downstairs and enter the dungeon, leaving the patrolling soldier alone with you. You can either sneak past him or kill him, as your objective is the chest in the northwestern corner. Open the chest and obtain the interrogation chamber key, Thalmor dossiers on Delphine and Ulfric Stormcloak, and the revealing document Dragon Investigation: Current Status, which proves the Thalmor are investigating the dragon attacks as well, with Rulindil in charge of interrogating a suspect in the cells. Torture Session[edit] Go down the stairs and enter the dungeon, where you will arrive at a balcony overlooking a bloodstained torture room and a number of cells. If used as a distraction, Brelas will be there too. If he wasn't killed in the previous room, Rulindil will be seated at the desk, while a Thalmor Soldier will do the dirty work and torture Etienne Rarnis while Rulindil asks a series of questions: ""I don't know his name."" ""And where can we find this nameless old man?"" Etienne: ""Stop. Please. I don't know anything else. Don't you think I'd have told you already?"" Soldier: ""Silence. You know the rules. Do not speak unless spoken to. Master Rulindil will ask the questions."" Rulindil: ""Let's begin again."" Etienne: ""No... for pity's sake... I've already told you everything..."" Rulindil: ""You know the rules."" Etienne: ""Noooooo!!!"" Rulindil: ""Start at the beginning, as usual. If you persist in this stubbornness I'll have..."" Etienne: ""No, wait! I was just... catching my breath... why wouldn't I tell you again? I don't even know anything... There's an old man. He lives in Riften. He could be this Esbern you're looking for, but I don't know. He's old and seemed kind of crazy. That's all I know."" Rulindil: ""And his name is...?"" Etienne: ""I don't know his name. Like I've told already a hundred- Ahhhh!"" Rulindil: ""You know the rules. Just answer the questions. And where can we find this nameless old man?"" Etienne: ""Like I said, I don't know! I've seen him down in the Ratway. Maybe he lives down there, but I don't know for sure."" Rulindil: ""That will be all for now. I must say I continue to be disappointed in your lack of cooperation. I hope next time you will do better."" Etienne: ""What else do you want from me? I've already told you everything. Listen, if you let me go I can take you to Riften, show you where- Gaaaaah!!!"" Soldier: ""Silence, prisoner!"" Rulindil attacks. With that last punch, Etienne finally loses consciousness and the Thalmor will leave him alone. Rulindil will stay behind his desk while the Thalmor Soldier will start patrolling the area. Your objectives are in the chest right next to Rulindil and in the soldier's possession. Two more soldiers will enter as soon as you advance the quest. Also, if you've gotten Brelas in trouble, she is imprisoned nearby. You can rescue her too (this not recommended due to a bug). As such, the best way to proceed is to kill Rulindil and his accomplice. Rulindil is a powerful wizard with countless spells at his disposal. Depending on your skill set, you may choose head-on combat or stealth assassination. Sneaking up on them with a dagger is one option. Using a crossbow and two vials of Paralysis Poison is another. Rulindil carries a wide array of items, such as spell tomes, poisons, and enchanted jewelry. Be sure to collect them. Now is a good time to save the game, if you want Malborn to survive and give you an optional quest later on. Escape the Embassy[edit] Enter Etienne's cell and tell him that you are here to help. Cut him loose and ask him if he knows anything of importance; he will then tell you about Esbern and the quest will update. You can also ignore Etienne and look in the chest by the back wall to the right of his cell, which contains a book titled Thalmor Dossier: Esbern; if you read it, the quest will also update. When that happens, quickly run up the eastern set of stairs (or better read it there), where you will find Malborn, now exposed for his treachery, and two Thalmor Soldiers. They will kill him on the spot if you let them, so kill both of them quickly and don't hit Malborn. After the battle, search the corpses for the trap door key (or pickpocket the key without combat) and return to Etienne who will be waiting near the trap door, or just go to the trap door. This will also be your last chance to free Brelas if you involved her in your distraction by speaking to Erikur. You will now have up to three followers, completely unable to fight, but unlock the trap door and enter Reeking Cave. Down there, a troll resides, so run ahead of the fugitives and kill it before they even notice it (as they will try to fight it and get killed in the process). If you had a follower when you spoke to Delphine at the stables, he or she will probably enter the cave at this point from the other side, and help to kill the troll. You can also just run through because trying to kill a big troll with your weak followers in the way is really hard without getting them killed. Lastly, locate the tunnel with a dead conjurer, the Illusion skill book Before the Ages of Man and an Unusual Gem. Exiting the cave will start the unnamed miscellaneous quest with the objective Recover your equipment, then prepare to deliver some surprising news to Delphine back in Riverwood. In the secret basement underneath the Sleeping Giant Inn, Delphine will anxiously await your return. When you tell her that the Thalmor have nothing to do with the dragon attacks, she will be quite surprised and ask for elaboration. When you tell her that they're looking for someone named Esbern, she will be shocked: ""Esbern? He's alive? I thought the Thalmor must have got him years ago. That crazy old man... Figures the Thalmor would be on his trail, though, if they were trying to find out what's going on with the dragons."" It turns out Esbern is a former Blade, just like Delphine, and that it makes perfect sense for the Thalmor to blame him for the dragons. When you tell her about Esbern's supposed location in Riften, she will immediately task you with tracking him down before the Thalmor do. She will then give you a secret phrase to gain Esbern's trust, the Diplomatic Immunity quest will end, and the next quest, A Cornered Rat, will begin. Recover your equipment[edit] Remember to claim all your belongings from Delphine's chest before leaving for Riften to complete the miscellaneous quest. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: Diplomatic Immunity (20 points/Bronze)"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Recover_your_equipment","Talk to Delphine in Riverwood. Meet Malborn in Solitude and give him any equipment you want smuggled into the embassy. Meet Delphine at the stables, wear the party clothes and hop in the carriage for a ride to the embassy. At the embassy, create a diversion and slip away from the party with Malborn. Recover Thalmor intelligence files from the ambassador's office. Go down to the dungeon and recover the rest of the documents. Obtain the key to the trapdoor and escape.","Diplomatic Immunity[edit] The Thalmor[edit] Malborn inside the Winking Skeever Travel to Riverwood. If you choose to travel with Delphine, and come close to her, she will stop and explain the complex background story about the Blades and how the Aldmeri Dominion wiped out all Blades during the Great War. While her memory of past events seems checkered at best, she at least provides some background information behind her hatred towards the Thalmor and a valid reason on why she suspects them for being responsible for the dragon attacks. Due to a travel bug, it is best to chat with Delphine at the beginning of her trip, then stop by the Braidwood Inn and rest, giving her time to travel alone. She has no special commentary at waypoints in this direction. Delphine will appear at The Bannered Mare in Whiterun and fuss at the Dragonborn for not meeting her in Riverwood. Once back in the Sleeping Giant Inn, she will head down to the secret basement and reveal that she has a plan. Delphine's dialogue Delphine: ""I figured out how we're going to get you into the Thalmor Embassy.""  You're not coming? That didn't take long. Why not just fight our way in? Thalmor Ambassador Elenwen often throws parties for the upper-class citizens of Skyrim. You are to meet a ""man on the inside"", Malborn, who will help you to the best of his abilities. He will meet you at the Winking Skeever in Solitude. In the meantime, Delphine will work on getting you a formal invitation to the party. Travel to Solitude and see Malborn. The Wood Elf[edit] According to Delphine, the Thalmor killed Malborn's entire family back in Valenwood, giving him plenty of good reason to help you out. You will find him inside the Winking Skeever, trying to keep a low profile. He will be quite surprised that she picked you for such a dangerous infiltration job, but will explain the situation. You are to carefully choose some equipment that he can smuggle into the embassy, preferably stealth-based, and he advises you not to try to bring anything yourself. When you're ready, hand him your preferred equipment. Don't forget to give him lockpicks if you want to access locked containers in the Embassy. After you close the menu, he will get up and leave. Delphine will now be waiting for you at Solitude Stables, just southwest of Solitude. Once you arrive, she will ensure that everything went smoothly with Malborn and will then hand you an official invitation along with a set of party clothes and boots to look the part. After you have changed she will take your remaining equipment and you will automatically board the carriage to the Thalmor Embassy. High-Class Party[edit] The Thalmor Embassy ""I am Elenwen, the Thalmor Ambassador to Skyrim."" The carriage driver will drop you off in the courtyard of the embassy and you will be greeted by the drunken ramblings of a Redguard named Razelan, apparently a high-ranking officer in the East Empire Company. As you approach the entrance, a Thalmor Soldier will ask for your invitation, so show it and go inside. Once you enter, party host Elenwen will be quick to seek you out and ask too many questions. Luckily, your friend Malborn is standing right behind her and will soon interrupt the embarrassing conversation and point Elenwen's attention elsewhere. Talk to Malborn, who will brief you; you are to create a scene so he can unlock the back door unnoticed. Look around the room and check out the guests. When asking around, you will quickly notice that the guests are either hateful Thalmor or high-ranked denizens of Skyrim who only participate in the party for personal benefit. With the exception of the hostess Elenwen, the drunken Razelan, the servant Brelas and the bard Illdi (or Grete if Illdi is dead ), the guests are often randomized or determined from your previous actions before even starting the quest. You can quickly create the distraction by talking to Erikur. Listen to his speech, then wait for him to harass Brelas. After he is finished, walk back to him and offer to talk to her in his stead. He will be very grateful. Regardless of what you say to Brelas, when you return to Erikur tell him, ""Yes. She said she can sneak you up to her quarters right now"". He will then immediately go to her and begin to accost her, drawing the attention of the guards. Quickly return to Malborn and proceed to the kitchen. There are no persuasion checks required for this and his disposition towards you does not affect the dialogue.  Brelas will later end up in a dungeon cell, but can be liberated. Alternatively, giving a bottle of Cyrodilic Brandy (which you can obtain from Malborn) to Razelan, whom you previously met outside, will make him inclined to create a disruption on your behalf if you request it of him.   Party Conversations In this randomly determined conversation, Elenwen will politely ask the guests if they're liking the party. Depending if they're happy or not, their answer will vary:    Order  Speaker  Line   #1  Elenwen  ""Are you enjoying the party?""   ""Is the food and drink to your liking?""   ""Is my staff seeing to your needs?""   #2  (in the faction MQ201PartyGuestHappy)Orthus EndarioProventus AvenicciSiddgeirMaven Black-BriarErikur Elisif the Fair  ""Everything is splendid, thank you.""   ""Very much so, and thank you for asking.""   (in the faction MQ201PartyGuestUnhappy)Aquillius AeresiusRazelanBalgruuf the GreaterIdgrod RavencroneIgmundGeneral TulliusVittoria Vici  ""As much as can be expected, yes.""   ""I have no complaints.""   ""I suppose so, yes.""   #3  Elenwen  ""Splendid. Call if you have need of me.""   ""It pleases me to hear you say so.""   ""Excellent. I'll leave you to it, then.""  The Jarls aligned with the Empire may also talk about problems running their hold due to recent events. They can either be Idgrod Ravencrone, Balgruuf the Greater, Siddgeir, Igmund, or Elisif the Fair. Again, they will choose between random lines:    Speaker  Line   Jarl#1  ""We've got our hands full dealing with the Stormcloaks. What about you?""   ""Are the dragons frightening your people as much as they're frightening mine?""   ""Have you found it difficult to get provisions lately? I can scarcely feed the staff in my palace.""   ""Between the dragons and the Stormcloaks, my coffers are running dry.""   Jarl#2  ""We've had the same troubles.""   ""I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.""   Jarl#1  ""With any luck, a worthy hero will step forward and solve our problems, just like in the tales of old.""   ""We must keep faith in ourselves and the Divines.""   ""These are troubling times, indeed.""  In yet another conversation, the party guests (except Ondolemar) will discuss current events:    Speaker  Line   Guest#1  ""I heard Elenwen say she's going open a bottle of her best Firebrand Wine later. I can hardly wait.""   ""These Stormcloaks are nothing more than an armed mob. This war won't last much longer.""   ""I hope they'll serve the roast venison with bittergreen sauce that we had at the last party. That was delicious.""   ""This war has taken a toll on the merchants of Skyrim. Let's hope that it ends soon, for their sake.""   ""I look forward to the day when this rebellion is put down, and we once again have peace.""   ""The Gray Quarter in Windhelm is little better than a slum. It's shameful that the dark elves are made to live that way.""   ""With the soldiers all fighting in the war, there's nobody to hunt down the bandits. Travel has become dangerous of late.""   ""It's been a brutal winter. I can't remember the last time it was this cold, and for this long.""   Guest#2  ""Yes, I agree with you. Have you heard any news from the other parts of Skyrim?""   ""You speak truly. Have you heard any interesting rumors of late?""   ""I'll not argue that. Heard any interesting gossip lately?""   ""I couldn't agree more. By the way, have you heard any interesting rumors lately?""   ""I couldn't have said it better myself. It's been some time since I've had news from elsewhere in Skyrim. What have you heard?""   ""I know just what you mean. Heard anything interesting lately? Any news or gossip?""   Guest#1  ""Well, I did hear that the Argonians have been banned from living inside the walls of Windhelm. They're only allowed on the city docks now. Most of them sleep together in one building, and they're as poor as wretches.""   ""Have you visited Rorikstead lately? No matter how harsh the winter, the crops that grow there never falter. Even when every other farm in the hold is barely scraping by, the harvest at Rorikstead is always bountiful. Is it good fortune? The blessings of the Divines? Who knows?""   ""Now that I think on it, I did hear something rather interesting the other day. Apparently, the Red Wave has been docked in Solitude for well over a month, and with no sign of shipping out any time soon. Some say the ship suffered damage to her hull when she struck an iceberg, and Captain Safia can't afford the repairs. Of course, she would never admit such a thing. Captain Safia is far too proud a woman for that.   ""Well, there might be nothing to it, but I've heard that the feud between the Gray-Manes and the Battle-Borns in Whiterun has grown ugly. Fralia Gray-Mane is convinced that the Battle-Borns have abducted one of her sons.""   ""I'm not sure that it's news, but lately it seems like every blacksmith in Skyrim is out to prove that he's the equal of Eorlund Gray-Mane. It's not really a fair comparison, if you ask me. After all, Eorlund works the Skyforge. How is any smith going to compete with that?""   ""Well, I did see something interesting not long ago. There were several Khajiit camped outside the walls of Whiterun. Seems they've been traveling around the whole of Skyrim peddling their wares. You've got to admire their courage, doing something like that with dragons on the loose and a war going on.""   ""I heard those mages up in Winterhold have been trying to figure out how many dragons there are in Skyrim. They seem to think it's at least a dozen, but I'm sure they're exaggerating. They're probably trying to scare us into giving them more money and influence, so they can save us from the dragons threat.""   ""Well, I did hear that Ulfric Stormcloak was slain while defending Windhelm against a dragon, but it sounds too good to be true. I'll wager it was Ulfric himself that started the rumor. Maybe he thought it would bolster recruitment."" (only heard if Ulfric is alive)   Ondelmar  ""The degeneracy of the Empire is on display here in this room.""   ""It's only a matter of time before your whole rotten Empire collapses of its own decay. No offense.""   ""None of these people cares a whit about the religious aspects of this war. Another sign of the degeneracy of your Empire.""   ""At least Ulfric's men are willing to fight for their principles, barbaric as they may be.""   ""It's a necessary part of my job to mix with the upper classes of Skyrim, such as they are.""

I just wanted to get a better look at you.  I like what I see, my dear.  And believe me, I don't say that to everyone.  I'm very discriminating when it comes to the female form. Brelas: Um, thank you.  Sir.  Was there anything else I can do for you? Erikur: Oh... not at the moment.  Maybe later.  Don't go far. Brelas: Yes, sir.  At this point, you need to speak to Brelas, and then either lie to Erikur or tell him the truth.   Lie Truth    Erikur: Hello, my dear.  I got your message.  Where shall we go? Brelas: What?  I'm sorry, sir, but you must have misunderstood.  I'm not permitted to leave the party. Erikur: Oh, I don't think so.  I think I understand perfectly.  Don't worry, my dear, I will make any necessary excuses to your employer.    Erikur: So you think you can toy with me, is that it?  No, my dear.  I have my heart set on you, and I always get what I want. Brelas: I'm sorry, sir.  I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression earlier.  I meant no disrespect. Erikur: Don't worry, I'll let you make it up to me.  Now, where can we go for a little privacy, hmm?   Brelas: No, I'm sorry, but I can't go anywhere with you.  I won't.  Please, I must get back to my duties. Erikur: Don't you dare walk away from me, you slut!  Do you know who I am? Brelas: Please, sir, leave me alone! Erikur: Now you're going to be sorry you crossed me.  Elenwen!  This servant girl has been throwing herself at me in a most disgusting manner. Elenwen: Is that so, Erikur?  And you with such delicate sensibilities.  It must have been most upsetting. Erikur: I demand that you have this wench removed from my presence at once! Elenwen: Well.  Whatever the truth of it, I'm sure a few words with Master Rulindil will have a salutary effect.  Take her downstairs. Brelas: No! Guard: Yes, Madame Ambassador. Brelas: Mistress Elenwen, it's not true!  I did nothing!  Sir, you must tell her!  You don't know what they'll do to me!  Please! Erikur: Well, I'm glad that little unpleasantness is over.  Brelas will be found in the torture room downstairs.  You can rescue her, after which she will move to the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm. ""Helping"" Erikur in this way befriends him, whether you lie to him or tell the truth, even if you rescue Brelas from her cell later.

Infiltration[edit] In the kitchen, the Khajiit cook Tsavani will complain about Malborn bringing a stranger into the kitchens, at least until Malborn reminds her of her secret Moon Sugar addiction. Malborn will then lead you into a room where you can receive the items you asked him to smuggle in. You should now be fully prepared for battle, and if not, then for stealth. If you are not, it is probably a good idea to re-open an earlier save and re-start the mission, as the Thalmor Wizards summon hostile Storm Atronachs, and you should be prepared enough to kill their mages or them. As soon as you exit through the door, Malborn will lock the kitchen area behind you and you are on your own, with the objective to find dragon-related intelligence. In the first hallway, you can eavesdrop on a conversation between two Thalmor Guards, hinting that Delphine may be wrong about the Thalmor: Guard #1: ""Did you see those robes march in this morning? Who're they with? More of the Emissary's treaty enforcers?"" Guard #2: ""No. They're high mages, just in from Alinor. I guess Herself is finally getting worried about all the dragon attacks."" Guard #1: ""Ah, good. I've been wondering how we were supposed to defend this place from a dragon."" Guard #2: ""If a dragon does show up, maybe we'll get lucky and it will eat the mages first. Might give us enough time to kill it."" Guard #1: ""Ha. I'd like to see those arrogant bastards taken down a notch. Always looking down their noses at us lowly footsloggers."" After a bit of mean-spirited laughter, one of the guards will say, ""Well, we'd better get back to our rounds."" and they will both return to their duties, unfortunately in the room you will have to pass through. Note that the full set of Thalmor clothes in the adjacent room was supposed to make you harder to detect, but due to a bug, the clothes don't work, as the desired effect was wrongfully set to the Hooded Thalmor Robes. You can claim a set of hooded robes from the Thalmor wizard in the upstairs area from the first room, but chances are he will detect you and call upon the two guards from downstairs. Regardless, you can choose between two  strategies; either take the stealthy approach, with or without the hooded robes, or go on a rampage and kill everybody. Hooded Thalmor Robes Method[edit] If you want to use the Hooded Thalmor Robes, as intended by the developers, either acquire some from the random Justiciars found in the wilderness, or aim to kill the wizard on the first floor. After you don the robes, you will be undercover if you're an elf, can walk past the guards (at a distance) if you are human, or will be immediately exposed if you are Khajiit or Argonian. Table   Race  Response   High Elf  ""Must be new around here.""   Wood Elf  ""Seems a bit short to me.""   Imperial/Nord/Redguard/Breton/Dark Elf/Orc  ""You there. I don't think I've seen you around before."" or ""Come here. Let me see your face."" or ""Haven't seen him/her around before."" or ""Must be new around here.""   Beast Race (Khajiit/Argonian)  ""Wait, is that a tail?""  If disguised as a Thalmor Wizard, you may dismiss the guard standing outside the Solar with a high enough speech check (if you cannot pass the speech check however, he'll notice that you're an intruder and everybody in the courtyard will turn hostile). Note that once you reach Elenwen's Solar, the patrolling guard, as well as Rulindil, are scripted to see through your disguise, regardless of race. This method is possible with a reasonably high Illusion skill (over 50) as other races by using Calm spells. It does not work for any other guards during this mission, and once you are inside the Solar, the guards will attack you on sight.  Speech check dialogue Thalmor Wizard: ""Why aren't you at your post, Justiciar?""  Emissary Elenwen was asking for you inside. (Persuade) Yes sir. Sorry sir. If the speech check is passed, he will respond: Thalmor Wizard: ""Why didn't you say so? Take over my post. Make sure nobody enters the Solar. Enter the Solar[edit] The first room contains the two talkative guards, with the Thalmor wizard patrolling the second floor. Right after their conversation ends, they will both turn their back to the door and return to their positions, giving you a chance to sneak upstairs and attempt to claim the robes by killing the wizard quietly. If not, you will have to take out the two guards and the wizard, and pick one of the two available doors leading to the outside courtyard. The area is patrolled by three Thalmor soldiers with another wizard standing guard near the front door to your target destination, the Solar of Elenwen. If you wear the hooded robes, the guards will not notice you, but the wizard cannot generally be avoided and will see through your disguise. To enter the Solar, you have a few options. The most straightforward is to fight them all. You can avoid the fight by using Calm, or by using Fury on one of the guards and then running in while they're busy with each other. Stealthy characters can fire arrows to distract the guards and pull the wizard away from the door. The door wizard occasionally looks to his left, leaving open an opportunity on his right for sneaking and invisible characters to get through the door before fully detected. Once the guards are dealt with and the way to the Solar is clear, enter sneak mode and head in. The Informant[edit] Once you get inside Elenwen's Solar, the true face of the Thalmor will start to show, although not in the way Delphine expected. When the door closes behind you, you should hide behind the plant in the southwestern corner and eavesdrop on the conversation between the Thalmor torturer Rulindil and his informant Gissur in the neighboring room. The conversation centers on a prisoner named Etienne and an unnamed old man: ""He knows where that old man is you're looking for..."" Gissur: ""But, I need that money! I earned it. I have my own expenses you know..."" Rulindil: ""Silence! Do not presume, Gissur. You are most useful, but do not presume. We have other informants who are less... offensive."" Gissur: ""But no one else has brought you such valuable information, have they? Etienne, he's talked, hasn't he? He knows where that old man is you're looking for, he told me himself."" Rulindil: ""You'll get the rest of your money when we confirm his story. As agreed."" Gissur: ""So he has talked! I knew it!"" Rulindil: ""Everyone talks, in the end. Now, I have work to do. Leave me to it, if you ever want to see the rest of your payment."" Gissur: ""Can I... I could help you. He'd talk to me. He trusts me."" Rulindil: ""You'd like to come downstairs with me, is that it, Gissur? Shall we loose his bonds and put you in a cell together? You can ask him anything you like, and see how he answers."" Gissur: ""No, no. I'll... I'll wait outside."" Rulindil: ""That would probably be best. Now get out!"" While an insulted Gissur obeys orders and leaves the building, Rulindil will head downstairs and enter the dungeon, leaving the patrolling soldier alone with you. You can either sneak past him or kill him, as your objective is the chest in the northwestern corner. Open the chest and obtain the interrogation chamber key, Thalmor dossiers on Delphine and Ulfric Stormcloak, and the revealing document Dragon Investigation: Current Status, which proves the Thalmor are investigating the dragon attacks as well, with Rulindil in charge of interrogating a suspect in the cells. Torture Session[edit] Go down the stairs and enter the dungeon, where you will arrive at a balcony overlooking a bloodstained torture room and a number of cells. If used as a distraction, Brelas will be there too. If he wasn't killed in the previous room, Rulindil will be seated at the desk, while a Thalmor Soldier will do the dirty work and torture Etienne Rarnis while Rulindil asks a series of questions: ""I don't know his name."" ""And where can we find this nameless old man?"" Etienne: ""Stop. Please. I don't know anything else. Don't you think I'd have told you already?"" Soldier: ""Silence. You know the rules. Do not speak unless spoken to. Master Rulindil will ask the questions."" Rulindil: ""Let's begin again."" Etienne: ""No... for pity's sake... I've already told you everything..."" Rulindil: ""You know the rules."" Etienne: ""Noooooo!!!"" Rulindil: ""Start at the beginning, as usual. If you persist in this stubbornness I'll have..."" Etienne: ""No, wait! I was just... catching my breath... why wouldn't I tell you again? I don't even know anything... There's an old man. He lives in Riften. He could be this Esbern you're looking for, but I don't know. He's old and seemed kind of crazy. That's all I know."" Rulindil: ""And his name is...?"" Etienne: ""I don't know his name. Like I've told already a hundred- Ahhhh!"" Rulindil: ""You know the rules. Just answer the questions. And where can we find this nameless old man?"" Etienne: ""Like I said, I don't know! I've seen him down in the Ratway. Maybe he lives down there, but I don't know for sure."" Rulindil: ""That will be all for now. I must say I continue to be disappointed in your lack of cooperation. I hope next time you will do better."" Etienne: ""What else do you want from me? I've already told you everything. Listen, if you let me go I can take you to Riften, show you where- Gaaaaah!!!"" Soldier: ""Silence, prisoner!"" Rulindil attacks. With that last punch, Etienne finally loses consciousness and the Thalmor will leave him alone. Rulindil will stay behind his desk while the Thalmor Soldier will start patrolling the area. Your objectives are in the chest right next to Rulindil and in the soldier's possession. Two more soldiers will enter as soon as you advance the quest. Also, if you've gotten Brelas in trouble, she is imprisoned nearby. You can rescue her too (this not recommended due to a bug). As such, the best way to proceed is to kill Rulindil and his accomplice. Rulindil is a powerful wizard with countless spells at his disposal. Depending on your skill set, you may choose head-on combat or stealth assassination. Sneaking up on them with a dagger is one option. Using a crossbow and two vials of Paralysis Poison is another. Rulindil carries a wide array of items, such as spell tomes, poisons, and enchanted jewelry. Be sure to collect them. Now is a good time to save the game, if you want Malborn to survive and give you an optional quest later on. Escape the Embassy[edit] Enter Etienne's cell and tell him that you are here to help. Cut him loose and ask him if he knows anything of importance; he will then tell you about Esbern and the quest will update. You can also ignore Etienne and look in the chest by the back wall to the right of his cell, which contains a book titled Thalmor Dossier: Esbern; if you read it, the quest will also update. When that happens, quickly run up the eastern set of stairs (or better read it there), where you will find Malborn, now exposed for his treachery, and two Thalmor Soldiers. They will kill him on the spot if you let them, so kill both of them quickly and don't hit Malborn. After the battle, search the corpses for the trap door key (or pickpocket the key without combat) and return to Etienne who will be waiting near the trap door, or just go to the trap door. This will also be your last chance to free Brelas if you involved her in your distraction by speaking to Erikur. You will now have up to three followers, completely unable to fight, but unlock the trap door and enter Reeking Cave. Down there, a troll resides, so run ahead of the fugitives and kill it before they even notice it (as they will try to fight it and get killed in the process). If you had a follower when you spoke to Delphine at the stables, he or she will probably enter the cave at this point from the other side, and help to kill the troll. You can also just run through because trying to kill a big troll with your weak followers in the way is really hard without getting them killed. Lastly, locate the tunnel with a dead conjurer, the Illusion skill book Before the Ages of Man and an Unusual Gem. Exiting the cave will start the unnamed miscellaneous quest with the objective Recover your equipment, then prepare to deliver some surprising news to Delphine back in Riverwood. In the secret basement underneath the Sleeping Giant Inn, Delphine will anxiously await your return. When you tell her that the Thalmor have nothing to do with the dragon attacks, she will be quite surprised and ask for elaboration. When you tell her that they're looking for someone named Esbern, she will be shocked: ""Esbern? He's alive? I thought the Thalmor must have got him years ago. That crazy old man... Figures the Thalmor would be on his trail, though, if they were trying to find out what's going on with the dragons."" It turns out Esbern is a former Blade, just like Delphine, and that it makes perfect sense for the Thalmor to blame him for the dragons. When you tell her about Esbern's supposed location in Riften, she will immediately task you with tracking him down before the Thalmor do. She will then give you a secret phrase to gain Esbern's trust, the Diplomatic Immunity quest will end, and the next quest, A Cornered Rat, will begin. Recover your equipment[edit] Remember to claim all your belongings from Delphine's chest before leaving for Riften to complete the miscellaneous quest. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: Diplomatic Immunity (20 points/Bronze)"

In force. Get down to the front line. This is it. We must hold the city. Move it!"" Upon leaving Dragonsreach, you will find Whiterun under siege by Stormcloak catapults. Along the city wall of the Plains District, the Imperial Legion will be returning fire with their own catapults. The streets will be busy with citizens running back to their houses and city guards making ready to fight the enemy. Whiterun will suffer great destruction during the battle. Severio Pelagia will be killed and his home, as well as Heimskr's, will be destroyed. The Bleeding Battlefield[edit] Just outside the city gates, you will find Legate Rikke on the strategically important main entryway, busy addressing a crowd of fully-armed Imperial Soldiers: ""This is it men! This is an important day for the Empire and for the Legion. And for all of Skyrim. This is the day we send a message to Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebel Jarls who support him. But make no mistake. What we do here today, we do for Skyrim and her people. By cutting out the disease of this rebellion, we will make this country whole again! Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion! Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!"" Soon after Rikke finishes her speech, the Stormcloaks will start their attack. Their archers will provide suppression fire from a distance outside the gate, while the main force will move up the main road in groups. First, you need to defend the barricades, then the drawbridge. Finally, you need to kill attacking soldiers until the percentage of attackers remaining drops to zero. Legate Rikke and Hadvar, both of whom are essential and cannot be killed, will give you a hand during the defense, so stay close to one or both of them if you are having difficulty. The united force of Whiterun guards and Imperial soldiers will take advantage of the fortifications and draw the attention of many enemies. Don't worry if you are unable to defend the barricades or drawbridge. It does not affect the ending of the quest or your reward. When the percentage of remaining attackers drops to zero, the battle will be over and this quest will be complete. Any surviving Stormcloaks will lose heart and flee the battlefield. This starts an unnamed miscellaneous quest with the objective Report to the Jarl of Whiterun. Also, completion of Battle for Whiterun automatically starts the next quest Reunification of Skyrim. Report to the Jarl of Whiterun[edit] The Inspiring Speech[edit] The Inspiring Speech Irileth will tell everyone to follow her, as Jarl Balgruuf the Greater wishes to speak. You may listen to his speech after the combat: ""Revel in your victory here today, even as the gods revel in your honor! They already sing of your valor and skill! The halls of Sovngarde are no doubt ringing with your praises! In defeating these Stormcloak traitors, you have proven the hollowness of their cause and the fullness of your hearts. The citizens of Whiterun are forever in your debt! But Ulfric will not stop here. No, he will continue to strike out against any true Nord who remains faithful to the Empire. He will continue to sow discord and chaos wherever he can. And so, we must each one of us, continue to fight this insurrection, lest our fallen brothers have died for naught! Lest our honor be lessened should we allow these bloodthirsty beasts to prowl our lands! Carry on men, my gratitude and blessings go with you! For Whiterun! For the Empire!"" At the end of his speech, you may talk to him. The jarl will thank you and grant you the privilege of buying a house in his city, if you haven't already: ""Thank you for your role in all of this. It'd be my honor should you decide to make Whiterun your home. Speak with Proventus. He'll make the necessary arrangements."". This completes the miscellaneous quest. Reward[edit] As part of the next quest, Reunification of Skyrim, when you return to General Tullius in Solitude, he commends you for the victory and gives you the rank of Quaestor, along with a leveled enchanted weapon."

It would be a wise choice to leave the giants and their herd mammoths in peace, especially if you are low level. Move swiftly and enter the cave before they turn hostile to you. Ulag's corpse can be found on a stone inside the cave with a giant wandering nearby. Search his body, where you'll find Ysolda's Message and a sample of Sleeping Tree Sap. If you don't want to fight the giant, get out of the cave with the message as quickly as possible. After reading the message, you'll get an idea about what caused Ulag's death. There was an arrangement between Ysolda and Ulag for purchase of the sap, which Ulag would obtain from the Sleeping Tree. Unfortunately, he risked the wrath of the giants one too many times, and ended up paying with his life. Travel to Whiterun and speak to Ysolda about the note you found. Ysolda will quickly realize what happened and offer you the same arrangement she had with Ulag, 150 gold for each sample of sap you bring to her.

The plants are indigenous to the volcanic tundra region of Eastmarch, and while desolate, the tundra is fairly easy to traverse with a few lesser animals and non-hostile giants. There are a few locations where it can be found in greater quantities than usual. Along with the quantities available, they are: 49 around Steamcrag Camp (Eastmarch) 47 around Witchmist Grove (Eastmarch) 35 around Eldergleam Sanctuary (Eastmarch) 33 around the Atronach Stone (Eastmarch) 31 around Bonestrewn Crest (Eastmarch) 26 around Kynesgrove (Eastmarch), especially along the road heading southeast 25 around Mistwatch (Eastmarch) 24 around Broken Limb Camp (Eastmarch) 23 around Cronvangr Cave (Eastmarch) 22 around Riverside Shack (Eastmarch) Once you have collected twenty samples, head back to Avrusa who will thank you for your aid and reward you with five random potions.

Clear Soljund's Sinkhole of draugr.","Outside the mine, Perth will stop you and say that the mine is closed until the jarl sends a group to clear out the draugr that infest it, but has given up hope of that ever happening. To complete the quest, enter the sinkhole and clear out the draugr. Upon entering the mine, you'll come to a junction. The left branch leads to a dead end area with three draugr and two moonstone ore veins. Up a ramp is the Light Armor skill book Jornibret's Last Dance, as well as some loose moonstone ore on a table. Heading back to the junction and down the right-hand passage takes you to a large, unclimbable sinkhole. There is one moonstone vein located directly before the sinkhole as well. When dropping down the sinkhole, prepare for a tough fight, as three leveled draugr will converge on you upon reaching the bottom. A fourth draugr will arrive later as well. A few magicka potions can be found along the passage leading to the next chamber, whose exit is blocked by a gate, and which contains three levers and another leveled draugr. Pull the left and right levers to open the gate and head up the spiral ramp; pulling the center lever will trigger a dart trap. The next chamber is accessed through a set of doors; a pressure plate right before them triggers a spear trap. Three leveled draugr inhabit this next chamber, the left side of which is floored with wooden planks covering a small pool containing an unlocked chest. Other loot in this room includes alchemical ingredients, some leveled armor, and two blocks of refined moonstone in a bookcase. The passage behind the doors ascends a flight of stairs, then winds deeper into the dungeon. A small, dark passage at the top of the stairs leads to a small room containing a leveled chest. A pressure plate just past the doors has no apparent effect. The final chamber consists of a moderately-sized open room, with a stone bier flanked by two statues, and houses a boss-level draugr. The right-hand statue will periodically glow with a green hue, which will heal the boss draugr, while the left-hand statue will periodically glow red, then shoot a fireball at you. This behavior ceases upon the boss draugr's destruction. To the left of the bier is an opening leading to a balcony, which contains a small passage leading back to the sinkhole chamber. Treasure in this room includes some ingredients on the bier and a boss chest behind it. On the way out, there are some ingredients and a leveled weapon resting on a pedestal, as well as two moonstone veins, one to the right of the table and one on the opposite side of the room. Return to Perth for a cash reward and his gratitude. He will also buy any moonstone ore you have acquired, should you wish to sell it."

Return to the quest giver.","Dengeir of Stuhn[edit] Dengeir of Stuhn was once the Jarl of Falkreath but has since stepped down and is now a Thane. He is a paranoid and patriotic supporter of the Stormcloaks. He believes that Lod the blacksmith is writing a treasonous letter and wants you to steal it for him. The letter is on Lod's bedside table. It is simply a note requesting extra iron. Steal it and return it to Dengeir. Dengeir will at first be confused, and then realize Lod is probably not up to treason, even if he is making extra weapons for the Empire. He will then give you a reward of leveled gold. Completion of this quest opens up another radiant quest, Dark Ancestor. Malur Seloth[edit] Talking to Malur Seloth and asking him what he does prompts him to reveal that he doesn't really do anything. He wants to appear more mage-like when in the jarl's presence, and wishes to acquire a staff. The one he wants belongs to Nelacar who resides in the inn. The staff is located in the shop counter in Nelacar's room. Steal it and return to Malur. He will reward you with one skill point in Speech. Stands-In-Shallows[edit] When speaking to Stands-In-Shallows, he mentions that he overheard sailors talking about their stashed extra powerful Skooma, and he would like to get it. The bottle is located in the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm, underneath the second set of stairs. Steal it and return to Stands-in-Shallows, who will reward you with a skill point in Sneak."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Soul_Cairn_Horse_Quest","(Optional) Talk to a distraught soul. Find Arvak's skull. Return to the soul.","This quest can only be started within the Soul Cairn. It can be started one of two ways, either by interacting with the distraught soul or by simply finding Arvak's skull. The soul who starts the quest can be found between where you enter and the large wall dividing the Soul Cairn. When first approaching him, you will hear him calling out to Arvak in distress, yelling, ""Arvak! Arvak, where are you? Arvak, please come back! Come back!"" and calling his name repeatedly. If you speak to him, he'll plead with you to help find Arvak. You'll have to ask him what he's talking about, and he'll explain, ""Arvak. My horse. We came to this horrible place together. We were attacked by monsters, so I told him to run."" He tells you how loyal Arvak is, and that the poor creature has been running for too long. He begs you to find Arvak's skull, giving you a quest to locate it. Arvak will then begin appearing at random and briefly running in the direction of his skull before disappearing again. From the entrance to the Boneyard, where Valerica is, head directly east. You will be able to see the tower and the four ghosts surrounding it, kneeling as if in prayer. Upon approaching the skull, the souls will turn into mistmen. After dealing with them, you are free to take the skull, causing the soul of its owner to materialize nearby, a short distance away from the shrine. He will thank you considerably, saying, ""He's such a loyal beast. Here, I'll teach you how to call him to you."" You will now have access to the spell Summon Arvak, which allows you to summon Arvak both within and outside of the Soul Cairn. Arvak's behavior is similar to a regular horse, though he will dissipate after 60 seconds from when you summon him if you are not mounted. As you walk away from the soul, he will express deep gratitude and joy to see his horse become free of that eternal prison; telling you, ""Goodbye, hero! Take good care of Arvak for me! Such a good horse."" After you have spoken to Arvak's rider, or if you decide simply to go to the skull initially and you are having trouble navigating the Cairn due to the poor in-game map visibility in comparison with the map presented below, try the following procedure: Walk through the dividing wall between the two halves of the Cairn to the side containing the pentagonal building, and stand a point in front (the northernmost side) of the first fully intact gateway structure facing the southwestern barrier along the path. Check your map, and then use it to rotate your character roughly 15 degrees East of North (to the right). Your gaze should be  fixed somewhere in between the southeastern most corner of the pentagonal building and the barrier of the Cairn opposing it. Walk straight in that direction, taking care (using the compass at the top of the screen) not to deviate from a straight path. The winding and discontinuous pathways beneath you are will only serve to get you lost, so ignore them. Travel in a straight line. If an obstacle comes in your way, or combat occurs and throws you off, re-orient yourself so that you are facing the same direction and are following the same line. You will find the skull just past the point where your position relative to the southeastern corner of the pentagon and the line you traversed is at a 90 degree angle. You will know that you have found this point when you are able to turn back along the same line you came on (an about face, or 180 degree rotation, looking back in the same direction you came from), then after turning 90 degrees to your right you will be directly facing the southeastern corner of the pentagonal building. A short walk past this point traveling in the same direction will put you at Arvak's Skull. When you reach the skull, turn 15 degrees south of east and travel a hundred paces or so, then you will come across  Arvak's rider to conclude the quest."

Return to the sword chamber.","As soon as you install the Dawnfang and Duskfang Creation, head to Riften. Townsfolk are talking about a ghost hiding in the Ratway and guards have warned them not to approach the area. As you begin your search, a ghostly apparition appears to guide you throughout the Ratway to the Guardian Vault. She then disappears in front of the Guardian Vault, leaving you to your investigation. In the chamber, you find a long dead skeleton and a sword. Upon inspecting the latter, the Vault Guardian tries to stop you and you have to defeat him. His death seems to have weakened the shield protecting the sword, and a door opens to the north. Head there to find once more the Vault Guardian and weaken the shield. Before leaving the northern room, be sure to open the cages to the left of the upper platform. Behind the gate there sits the skeleton of Verrick Tilwald, which will reanimate and attack you as you enter. Once the skeleton is dispatched, take Verrick's Note, which is pinned beneath a dagger on the table next to Of Crossed Daggers. Reading this will initiate the Bloodthirst quest.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sovngarde_(quest)","Once you've entered Sovngarde, continue down the path. Find out how to defeat Alduin. Gain admittance to the Hall of Valor. Talk to the heroes of Sovngarde.","Inside the Hall of Valor You are transported to a misty realm filled with statues of Nord warriors. The mist has no noticeable effect on you and can be temporarily cleared with the Clear Skies shout, but it quickly rematerializes. Upon continuing down the stone steps, you may be stopped by a Stormcloak soldier who says that the mist is extremely dangerous and that you should not go into it. He died fighting the Imperial Legion, and all his companions have been swallowed up by the mist, where he says Alduin lurks, devouring souls. He also tells you that at the end of the valley of mist lies Shor's Hall, where the heroes of Sovngarde gather. He begs you to allow him to follow you. True enough, Alduin will periodically swoop in and grab a fallen Stormcloak or Legion soldier in the misty valley. On the way, you may encounter historical figures such as High King Torygg and Svaknir, along with NPCs that have died in the course of the game, such as Kodlak Whitemane, Ulfric Stormcloak, Legate Rikke, or Galmar Stone-Fist. Once clearing the mist, you'll reach the edge and be stopped by the gate guardian, Tsun. He challenges your right to enter the Hall of Valor and declares that you must prove your worth in a warrior's duel regardless of the right that you claim. The first claim 'by the right of birth' will always appear regardless of what you have done in the game, but the remaining ones can only be used if you have completed the quests of the Companions, the College of Winterhold, the Dark Brotherhood and/or the Thieves Guild, respectively. Option  Dialogue   By the right of birth. I am Dragonborn.  ""Ah! It's been too long since last I faced a doom-driven hero of the dragon blood.""   By right of glory. I lead the Companions of Jorrvaskr.  ""I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-brother/shield-sister to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain.""   By right of Cleverness. I am Master of the College of Winterhold.  ""Well met, mage of Skyrim.

I am a Nightingale of Nocturnal.‡  ""Do not mistake the night-shrouded thief's stealthily-taken spoils, stolen and unearned, for a warrior's plunder, won in honorable battle. Your doom already binds you to your dark mistress, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand."" † Also requires Hail Sithis! to be completed.  ‡ Only requires Trinity Restored to be completed. He is fast and deals an enormous amount of damage, so if you are having trouble beating him, you can run back down the steps and into the water, as he will stand at the edge and be unable to attack you. Poison potions will significantly help the battle against him and with the right potions may end the battle immediately or greatly shorten the length of the battle. Fire spells work particularly well against him, as do ranged attacks. You do not need to initiate conversation in order to earn entrance. Inside, you are greeted by Ysgramor, founder of the Companions and harbinger of men, who asks you to speak to the Nord heroes of old who battled Alduin (as seen in the Elder Scroll): Gormlaith Golden-Hilt, Hakon One-Eye, and Felldir the Old. The Hall is filled with Heroes of Sovngarde, including some very notable ones like Jurgen Windcaller, Olaf One-Eye, and Ulfgar the Unending. When you meet with the three heroes that you are directed towards, they decide to join Shouts with you to clear the mist from Sovngarde. The quest ends with you running out to join them near the misty valley."

Steal the statue and return to Degaine for your reward.","A Golden Statue[edit] The Temple of Dibella If you speak to  innkeeper Kleppr or his wife Frabbi in the Silver-Blood Inn, they will tell you about the beggar named Degaine: ""Degaine the beggar got himself kicked out of the Temple of Dibella. Caused quite the ruckus."" You will then be given the objective to speak to Degaine, who can usually be found begging near the marketplace. Upon approaching him, he will express his interest in stealing a statue: ""Aye, a whole heap of it. You see that Temple? Way up there. All them women, keeping to themselves. Won't let poor Degaine in, no. Not even for a look. But they've got a treasure in there. Gold statue, size of a child. Who knows what they use it for, but I know what I'll use it for."" Inquire why he wants to steal the statue and he will tell you: ""Well let's not put it like that. Wouldn't want the Thieves Guild catching wind of us, eh? Nah, just creep in and have a go at taking it out. I'll be here, and pay you half of what my man in Riften promised for it. You'll be helping out an old beggar, and the Divines smile on that sort of thing."" The statue itself is located within the Inner Sanctum of the temple. This makes finding the temple itself easier, but is not necessary to initiate The Heart of Dibella quest. The Temple of Dibella[edit] Upon entering the temple, you will find the priestess Senna, who will inform you that: ""The sisters are communing with Dibella. They can't be disturbed. You'll have to come back another time."" In order to access the Inner Sanctum, you can either try to pick the expert-lock, or steal the key from Senna. Note that if you choose to pick the lock and are not caught by one of the priestesses, you'll have to do it twice—once to get into the Sanctum, and once to get out. If you are caught by one of the priestesses, Hamal will confront you. You will then have the option to find the Sybil. If you choose not to do so, the priestesses will become hostile and attack you. If you kill them, you will be unable to complete The Heart of Dibella quest. If you successfully retrieve the statue, you can turn it over to Degaine who will hastily say: ""Give it to me quickly, before they see us together. You've riled up the priestesses, and the guards don't take kindly to that. Here's your share. Nicely done."" He then gives you 150 gold in exchange for the statue. At this point, in order to start The Heart of Dibella, you will have to return to the temple and deliberately get noticed."

Speak to Karliah.","Where the End Began...[edit] Mercer breaking into Snow Veil Sanctum Journey to Snow Veil Sanctum, which is northeast of Windhelm. When you arrive you will find an abandoned camp near the entrance along with a dead horse. Continuing onward, you will see Mercer Frey waiting outside the ruin's entrance. As you approach, Mercer will initiate a conversation with you: ""Good, you're finally here. I've scouted the ruins and I'm certain Karliah is still inside."" Asking if he saw Karliah, he will tell you: ""No, I found her horse. Don't worry, I've taken care of it... she won't be using it to escape. Let's get moving, I want to catch her inside while she's distracted. Take the lead."" If you choose to question his methods, he will sarcastically reply: ""I'm sorry, I was under the impression I was in charge. You're leading and I'm following. Does that seem clear to you?"" Once you finally agree with his plan, he will continue: ""Just make certain you keep your eyes open. Karliah is as sharp as a blade. The last thing I need is you blundering into a trap and warning her that we're here."" At this point, he will act as a temporary follower. Making your way towards the door to the Snow Veil Catacombs, you will soon realize that the door itself is locked and cannot be opened without a key. You must then wait for Mercer to open the door, and while he is opening the door, he will provide a running commentary: ""They say that these ancient Nordic burial mounds are sometimes impenetrable. This one doesn't look too difficult. Quite simple really, I don't know what the fuss is about these locks. All it takes is a bit of know-how and a lot of skill."" After Mercer has managed to unlock the door, he will say: ""That should do it. After you."" Continue inside the ruin with Mercer, who will comment about the surroundings: ""The stench in here... this place smells of death. Be on your guard."" Inside the ruins, you will face multiple leveled draugr as well as several traps along the way. In the first room, you will find a dead draugr as well as several urns and a trapped chest. If not disarmed, opening the chest triggers draugr to awaken and attack you. Also pulling a chain located to the right side of the room will open one of the two gates containing minor loot. A crypt rigged with bone chimes Continue into the next room where several more draugr lie dead on the floor. Mercer will warn you of a spike trap that is triggered when pulling the chain: ""Pull the chain over there, and watch out for the spikes. Looks like Karliah reset all of the traps."" Proceeding onward into the corridor, several sleeping draugr can be found along the way, who will awaken and attack you as you pass. There is also an adept-locked door located to the right of the corridor containing minor loot. Some bear traps are located along the corridor as well. As you approach a fire trap, Mercer will again warn you by saying: ""There's two more of them ahead."" Continuing along the corridor, there is a metal gate which needs to be opened. To open the gate, there is a chain located to the left in an alcove. Moving forward, an apprentice-locked door straight ahead leads to a small room which has a perch where you can take out a few of the draugr found in the next chamber. The Model Ship for The Litany of Larceny A potion for health, magicka, and stamina are hidden behind the table on your left upon entering this room. Proceeding back you will come across a room with several bone chimes. Mercer will warn: ""Bone chimes... clever. Rigged to wake the draugr I'd bet. Don't blunder into any of them."" Once you make it across to the other side of the room, there is a chain on the right-hand side of the metal gate. Moving onward down several flights of stairs, you will come to the large chamber seen before in the other room. Upon entering, several draugr will awaken if you haven't already taken them out. If you choose to go up the flight of stairs directly ahead of you, you will come across a room containing a model ship which is needed for the quest The Litany of Larceny. The ship is located on a pedestal, which upon removing, will trigger a fire trap surrounding it. To proceed forward, there is a flight of stairs located to the right of the chamber which leads overhead to the next zone: Snow Veil Sanctum.  ...and the Beginning Ends[edit] A dragon priest guarding the word wall Mercer cracking the puzzle door As you enter the next zone, you will encounter several leveled draugr who will awaken and attack you. Continuing along the corridor, there is a chain located to the left which opens the metal gate in front. As you proceed forward, Mercer will comment: ""We're on the right track. She's been through here as well."" Before the flight of stairs, you will find a leveled draugr wandering the nearby area. As you continue, you will come across a wooden double-door which leads onto another large chamber. Mercer will advise you about the door ahead: ""That door up ahead...  looks perfect for hiding an ambush. Be ready."" Once you enter the chamber, multiple leveled draugr will awaken and begin to ambush you and Mercer. At higher levels, a dragon priest may spawn by the word wall for the Disarm shout. Also located in this chamber is a copy of the Light Armor skill book Ice and Chitin which can be found on a table. Proceed to the left of the chamber where another metal gate is closed. The chain for this gate is located to the right of the gate itself. As you make your way along the short corridor, you will come across several more bear traps before you are confronted by a Nordic puzzle door. It is not necessary to decipher it, as Mercer will open it, providing another commentary: ""Ah, it's one of the infamous Nordic puzzle doors. How quaint. Without the matching claw, they're normally impossible to open. And since I'm certain Karliah already did away with it, we're on our own. Fortunately, these doors have a weakness if you know how to exploit it. Quite simple, really. Karliah's close. I'm certain  of it. Now let's get moving."" Once Mercer opens the door and you step through into the next chamber, Karliah will shoot you with a poisoned arrow and the scene fades to black. In a cutscene, you lie immobile but cognizant as you witness a conversation between Karliah and Mercer, in which you learn that it was in fact Mercer who killed Gallus. Mercer confronting Karliah Mercer: ""Do you honestly think your arrow will reach me before my blade finds your heart?"" Karliah: ""Give me a reason to try."" Mercer: ""You're a clever girl, Karliah. Buying Goldenglow Estate and funding Honningbrew Meadery was inspired."" Karliah: ""'To ensure an enemy's defeat, you must first undermine his allies.' It was the first lesson Gallus taught us."" Mercer: ""You always were a quick study."" Karliah: ""Not quick enough, otherwise Gallus would still be alive."" Mercer: ""Gallus had his wealth and he had you. All he had to do was look the other way."" Karliah: ""Did you forget the Oath we took as Nightingales? Did you expect him to simply ignore your methods?"" Mercer: ""Enough of this mindless banter! Come, Karliah. It's time for you and Gallus to become reunited!"" Karliah: ""I'm no fool, Mercer. Crossing blades with you would be a death sentence. But I can promise the next time we meet, it will be your undoing."" Karliah tending to your wounds after Mercer's betrayal Karliah then disappears using an invisibility potion. Mercer will then approach you as you lie on the ground, saying aloud: ""How interesting. It appears Gallus's history has repeated itself. Karliah has provided me with the means to be rid of you, and this ancient tomb becomes your final resting place. But do you know what intrigues me the most? The fact that this was all possible because of you. Farewell. I'll be certain to give Brynjolf your regards."" He will then stab you and walk away, leaving you to die in the sanctum. As you regain consciousness, you will find yourself outside of the Snow Veil Sanctum. As you get up, you will notice Karliah approaching saying, ""Easy, easy. Don't get up so quickly. How are you feeling?"" Exclaiming that she shot you, she will correct you: ""No, I saved your life. My arrow was tipped with a unique paralytic poison. It slowed your heart and kept you from bleeding out. Had I intended to kill you, we wouldn't be having this conversation."" As you ask Karliah why she saved you, she will explain: ""My original intention was to use that arrow on Mercer, but I never had a clear shot. I made a split second decision to get you out of the way and it prevented your death."" After a while, you will learn that she had hoped to capture Mercer alive and to bring him to justice for what he has done. Karliah will go on to say that she managed to acquire Gallus' encoded journal and asks that you travel to Winterhold and speak to Enthir about getting its contents translated, which starts the next quest."

Speaking with her, you can give her the Sheogorath-Shaped Amber, the Sword of Jyggalag, or neither. If you choose to give her either the amber or the sword, she will give you her helmet as a reward, then disappear. Keeping both items will turn her hostile, but you can use the amber to learn a permanent summon spell for her (see notes section).

Return to Shadr.","Feeling Blue[edit] Upon your initial entry to Riften, a conversation will take place between Sapphire, a member of the Thieves Guild, and Shadr. She is berating him for not paying his debt, to which he replies that he couldn't because his shipment was attacked. Sapphire alludes to the fact that she was behind it, but doesn't forgive his debt and demands that he pay it. She then walks off towards The Bee and Barb. Shadr is usually on the bridge near the north entry gate (either standing or sitting on the bench), and when you talk to him he will explain his situation. You may then offer to assist him. Dealing with Sapphire[edit] When you speak with Sapphire you have a number of options for rectifying the situation: If you are not a member of the Thieves Guild: You are presented with the options of  persuading Sapphire to clear the debt or paying it yourself. If you are a member of the Thieves Guild: You will be presented with the same options for persuading, but convincing Sapphire will take a bit more skill. You can also threaten to expose her scheme to Brynjolf for a cut. If you are the Guildmaster: Sapphire will apologize about the scam and claim that she was going to talk with Delvin about cutting the Guild into the deal. You can either tell her to forget about the debt or split the money. If you accept the cut-in, you still need to return to Shadr to complete the quest. Reward[edit] If you were successful in having Sapphire erase the debt, return to Shadr who is grateful and gives you a leveled potion of invisibility. This will also increase Shadr's disposition towards you, meaning that you may be able to take items from the Riften Stables, including borrowing a horse.

Obtain the Smuggler's Ledger from Modig Gilgar at his besieged cart near the Western Watchtower (map). Enter Brittleshin Pass and take the Staff of Hasedoki from Ivara of Olenveld.","Smuggled Goods[edit] Travel to an unmarked bandit camp located beneath a cliff, west of Dragonsreach (map). Once there, you must deal with the hostile bandits and locate the Smuggler's Trade Notes (not to be confused with the Smugglers' Note located nearby). Reading it will reveal that the smugglers were recently approached by an Orc looking to purchase the Staff of Hasedoki, a legendary artifact which they had recently sold to someone else. The smugglers sold this Orc the location of the buyers, planning to intercept and ambush him. Be wary if you are looting the camp, as opening the nearby chest will cause more bandits to spawn. Bonemen fill the passages of Brittleshin Pass The ambush site is located along the road west of Whiterun, next to the ruined house near the Western Watchtower (map). The Orc in question, Modig Gilgar, will be found standing over the bodies of multiple bandits. He will turn hostile if you get too close, so you are left with the option to either kill him or pickpocket him to obtain the Smuggler's Ledger. Reading this will reveal the location of the buyers: Ivara of Olenveld and Lushak gra-Ragdam, located in Brittleshin Pass. Be sure to check Modig's cart for loot, including a copy of To Raise the Living as well as a container named Modig's Satchel which holds minor loot. A Path to the Soul Cairn[edit] You must now venture to Brittleshin Pass, and enter either through its north or south entrance. Taking the southern approach will result in marginally fewer enemies to face. The enemies in question are bonemen, which appear in addition to the usual undead skeletons encountered in Brittleshin Pass. You will need to make your way to the inner sanctum, where the boss level necromancer would usually be present. In his place, you will find Lushak gra-Ragdam and Ivara of Olenveld, two necromancers who will be hostile on sight. Beware Ivara, as she wields the Staff of Hasedoki. She can repeatedly use the staff to immobilize you. Once you've defeated them both, the remaining bonemen will disappear, leaving you free to loot and exit the cave. Lushak carries copies of Arkay the Enemy and The Black Arts On Trial, the latter being an Illusion skill book. Ivara carries copies of The Light and the Dark, Ivara's Notes, and Souls, Black and White, as well as the Staff itself. Reading her notes will reveal that the two necromancers traveled all the way from the island of Olenveld to open a portal to the Soul Cairn and offer Hasedoki's soul to earn the favor of the Ideal Masters. Loot his Staff from Ivara's corpse to end this plot and complete the quest. The Staff creates a permanent 40-point ward protection while being held, and when cast it will ragdoll and forcefully knock targets backwards. (This includes you during your fight against Ivara.) If the target then dies within 60 seconds, they will be soul trapped."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Staff_of_Magnus","Travel to Labyrinthian. Kill the dragon priest Morokei. Retrieve the Staff of Magnus.","To Save the College[edit] A ghostly image of Savos and his companions After the Containment quest, you must leave the college at Mirabelle Ervine's behest, outfitted with the Torc of Labyrinthian and Savos Aren's Amulet. Your destination is Labyrinthian, which will be marked on your map, where you must retrieve the Staff of Magnus in order to contain the Eye of Magnus. Labyrinthian sits nestled in a pass through the mountains southeast of Morthal. It can be approached from the north or south end of the pass. Following the quest marker, at the top of one of the many staircases, you will arrive at the Ceremonial Door, which is the entrance to the ruin's interior. Here a ghostly after-image of a younger Savos Aren and five adventurous mages from the college, Atmah, Girduin, Takes-In-Light, Hafnar Ice-Fist and Elvali Veren, will appear. Apparently, the late Arch-Mage had explored the ruins before and the apparitions will replay their experience as you progress through the ruins. Labyrinthian[edit] The Skeletal Dragon The Labyrinthian indoor ruins are fairly straightforward and guarded by a number of undead. The entrance room is littered with skeleton corpses; at the opposite end of the room, on your right, you will find a spell tome on an altar. Proceed through a passage leading to a closed gate opening on a wide room. Levers on each side of the gate can be used to raise it, but it will fall down after a few seconds. A number of skeletons await beyond the gate, as well as a Skeletal Dragon. It is possible to raise the gate and shoot through the open entrance without entering. You can thus eliminate the skeletons and even the dragon before going into the room. In addition, the dragon doesn't seem to be able to fit through the gate, so if you have entered, you can retreat back through it to take cover. Loot the cavern and descend the stairs where another ghostly scene will relay the events of Girduin's death. Take a moment to read the etched tablet introducing visitors to the great city of Bromjunaar, then proceed into the Labyrinthian Chasm. Opening the door, you will find twin staircases leading down. Check the alcove on the right for a hidden chest, then take the right-hand staircase down. When you emerge into the chamber you will hear Morokei's voice, resonating with glowing power, addressing you in the dragon language ""Wo meyz wah dii vul junaar?"". As he speaks, a large portion of your magicka will drain. As his voice subsides, a closed door is apparent. The door seems to be covered in ice, and then, as if to confirm, a frost spirit will emerge from the doorway. A draugr is also standing in one of the alcoves in this room. After removing the enemies, locate a flames spell tome which is in an alcove nearby. Cast a flames spell at the icy door to melt the ice crystals and open the door. Entering the chasm beyond, Morokei will again address you, draining your magicka: ""Nivahriin muz fent siiv nid aaz het"". From the doorway, you will see a draugr standing below; an easy target for a ranged attack. There are several more draugr roaming this area, so be on guard. After eliminating the threat, enter the tunnel to find a door guarded by a lightning rune. Behind the door, another draugr is in a small room with the Equilibrium spell tome. Return to the chasm and descend another level. There are several more draugr roaming this area, so be on guard.  Here, the passageway will fork, with a bridge in front of you and a side passage continuing deeper into the chasm. You will hear Morokei's voice once again, this time speaking in your ""guttural"" language, trying to engage you in conversation. Either path, across the bridge or along the side wall, lead to the bottom of the chasm; however, the bridge features more draugr. Beyond, the cave leads to a river running through the chasm. A door at the far end of the passage leads to the next section of the ruins. Approaching the door, you hear Morokei plaintively asking for Aren. Labyrinthian Thoroughfare[edit] Once inside open the next gate that leads to a sunken cavern strewn with stalactites and stalagmites.  Haunting this cavern is a skeleton and a draugr. Once you eliminate them, you can either open a novice-locked gate to the west, or take a passage to the north. If you open the gate take a few steps downstream and turn right. Travel through the small room and proceed onward. If you take the passage to the north, you will arrive at the same place after meeting a skeleton. As you travel through, Morokei speaks to you once again, this time taunting you as your magicka drains away. The next large room you come to is occupied by a troll. There are three barred windows providing a view of the next multi-leveled cavern. The entrance to this cavern is located to the right of these windows. In the next cavern, you will hear from Morokei goading you once again. You will battle more skeletons as you descend into the cavern. At the first landing is a bridge heading west. This leads to a small room with two trolls and a chest. Go down the second set of stairs to the lever-controlled gate. When you approach the gate, Morokei will again speak to you, this time recognizing that you are not Savos Aren. As Morokei has depleted your magicka again, wait for it to regenerate, if you wish, before opening the gate. Beyond the gate you will find skeletons and a swarm of wisps as well as a wispmother. If you turn left through the gate, keep turning left and you will find 2 well-hidden flights of stairs in a corner; at the top are two skeletons (including a magic-user), an unlocked chest and a random aversion potion. You can jump over a dividing wall to kill/loot the skeletons if necessary, or just leave them be. Climb back down the stairs to ground level when you're done and proceed. Go up a short flight of stairs in the west corner and across the raised dais to a door sealed with fire. As you approach, you will hear Morokei acknowledge that your power feeds his own, and then a fire spirit will spawn and attack. Once the spirit is dead, cast a frost spell on the door to open it. If you do not yet have a frost spell, a Frostbite spell tome or ice-based scrolls can be found on a round table to the left of the door. And then there were three... Beyond this door you will find a short passage and a gate leading into a circular room. As you enter, another vision of young Savos Aren and his companions will appear, their numbers somewhat depleted by now. The next room is guarded by a skeleton, a Spectral Warhound and a ghostly draugr wight. Be careful as you approach; Morokei's voice invites you to your doom while draining your magicka once again. A cascade of water flows into a trap door in the floor, and there is a passage onwards. Either the trap door or the passage lead to the same room below, however, if you open the trap door and do not land on the log to break your fall or otherwise protect yourself, the fall is likely to kill you. Through this tunnel system you will meet more draugr wights. Fighting through you will find the door leading to the next zone, Labyrinthian, Tribune. Labyrinthian, Tribune[edit] Proceeding a short distance past the door, you will encounter two ghostly draugr wights, one of them a boss, and another spectral warhound. Around the next corner you will find a spell tome for Steadfast Ward on a podium. Go down the stairs and into a room with three spellcaster traps that will unleash powerful destruction spells at you. There is a frost rune on the floor midway down, and another guardian may await at the other end of the room. Next, go up a short flight of stairs to a ledge overlooking another cavern with a small pool below and another draugr. To the left is a wooden ramp up to a room and two additional spectral draugr along with some loot. To the right is a dirt path leading down to the room below. Exit the cave and at the end of the corridor you will find a skeleton shackled to a wall with a leveled dagger in its chest. To the left, an adept-locked gate leads to a few valuable items and the unique item Ancient Helmet of the Unburned. To the right is a set of iron doors. When you approach the doors, you will see the visual phenomenon of Morokei's voice, but no voice is heard. However, your magicka will be drained again. Open the doors to see a throne facing away from you with a high-leveled draugr attended by a Spectral Warhound companion. Once the fight is over, you can approach the word wall to the southwest of the throne to learn a word of the Slow Time shout. On the opposite side of the room to the word wall, you can pass through the right side of the tree to find a chest hidden behind a rock. After the throne room, you will enter a corridor with a series of columns on each side. Progress with care, as you will experience another magicka-draining effect, and activate a group of skeletons and ghostly draugr. At the opposite end of the corridor, the ghostly Savos and a diminished band of his companions lament that not all of their number have made it this far. One of them mentions a feeling that the final trial lies beyond the next door, and they vow to stick together and move forward. Open the iron door to the south. The battle against the Dragon Priest[edit] Two enthralled wizards holding Morokei with magic As you enter the large room, Morokei is completely protected by an energy shield cast by two enthralled wizards. You will soon learn that they are two of Savos' companions that were sacrificed to keep the dragon priest contained so Savos could escape. You need to remove the wizards and their casting in order to access Morokei. A variety of strategies and techniques can be used to win this encounter; suggestions and tips are below: The mages can be targeted from the corridor leading to the room, allowing you to replenish your resources before engaging Morokei. Drainspell Bows (from the ghostly draugr encountered in Labyrinthian) have been proven to be effective against the mages. You can also use the doorway to your advantage by opening and closing the doors when engaging Morokei. The platforms around the walls of the room provide elevated positions that should provide you with an edge in the fight. It is possible to climb the wall immediately to the left and approach from above. You can sneak attack both wizards and have a good vantage point to attack Morokei. Morokei can conjure a storm atronach and employs Command Daedra and seems to prefer ranged and magical attacks, avoiding fighting at close quarters. Most of his offensive spells are shock based, so equipping yourself with enchanted items such as Zahkriisos'DB and Otar's masks or using potions to resist shock damage will severely hamper his attacks. It appears that if you can back him into the small pool in the room, he cannot get out of the water, which traps him, but he can still fight back. If you get his health down a bit, then switch to a low power constant-effect spell or staff (e.g. Staff of Sparks), he'll keep his costly ward spell up constantly and deplete his own magicka. When he runs out of magicka he's powerless. He can turn your summons against you. If he does, then you recast the summon and get a new one, he won't turn them more than once or twice. However, he cannot manipulate Flaming Familiars, acquired from protecting Anska in High Gate Ruins, though completing that quest requires you to confront another dragon priest. At a high enough level, it is possible to summon a Dremora Lord against Morokei; he cannot turn Dremora as he can Atronachs. Beware Morokei's range, and note that the first rank of the Summoner Conjuration perk is sufficient to close the distance between platforms. The Enthralled Wizards can be frenzied using illusion spells and seem to be surprisingly resilient to Morokei's attacks. They can be used to soften him up or even kill him. Spell Absorption will cause Morokei's attacks to replenish your magicka rather than depleting it. You can also call on a mage-type follower, such as SeranaDG or Erandur, to drain his magicka pool with lightning spells, or have them attack head-on while you flank the dragon priest. There are two platforms that the mages were standing on keeping Morokei imprisoned. If you stand on the higher platform, keeping a few feet from the edge so that you are between the pillars holding up the dragon head and use ranged attacks (preferably arrows poisoned with damage magicka regen) against him so that the lower half of his body is eclipsed by the small flame pits that hang over the edge, when he returns fire his lightning spells will scatter off of the surroundings leaving you completely unaffected with him under the impression that you are taking damage. If your follower is keeping him busy on the lower platform across from it so that he cannot come down the stairs this can make for a quick fight. He can be lured down the stairs to the exit, where he may become stuck at a point next to the stairs and be unable to path to you or return ranged attacks. Once the dragon priest has been defeated, collect both Morokei's mask and the Staff of Magnus. Your next objective will be to return to Tolfdir. Problems at Home[edit] Proceed through the door toward a shortcut out of Labyrinthian. Savos will again manifest, apologizing for sacrificing his companions to keep the Dragon Priest imprisoned, and swearing to seal the ruin. Unbar and open the wooden door. As you open a gate to the next room, Estormo, a Thalmor mage and associate of Ancano, will enter the room from the other side and block your path. He will tell you that he will take the Staff from you because Ancano wants it kept safe, and also wants you dead. Optionally defeat Estormo, and leave Labyrinthian. Outside, you will not be able to fast travel to the College. The nearest destination to which you can fast travel is Winterhold. Once you arrive there, enter the gate to the College. You will find Tolfdir, along with Faralda and Arniel Gane battling magic anomalies. Once the anomalies are gone, speak to Tolfdir. He tells you that Ancano's power is growing, and that they cannot stop him. He ruefully hopes your trip to Labyrinthian was worth it. If you ask about Mirabelle, Tolfdir will tell you that she is dead; killed while ensuring everyone's escape from Ancano. Tolfdir asks you to lead the group inside to deal with Ancano. This completes the quest and initiates the Eye of Magnus quest."

There is a hidden panel to the rear of the eastern room, which leads to the basement. In the safe to the right of the shelves are the first and second letters from Linwe, the Summerset Shadows leader. The second option is to tell her you've ""had enough of this"" (one of the dialogue choices). At this point, she becomes hostile, allowing you to kill her without accruing a bounty--nearby NPCs will even help you. You can then loot the letter from Linwe off her corpse. However, if kept alive, she becomes a fence after completing this quest, so the first option may be preferable. Either way reveals that the rival guild were not responsible for Fjotli's death, merely that they looted her body, and that their hideout is in Uttering Hills Cave. Send a Message[edit] The burning banner Uttering Hills Cave is in the mountains to the west of Windhelm. Travel there, and either sneak past or kill the Summerset Shadow lookouts outside. None of the generic Shadows can be looted for their armor. Inside, on the small table is a leveled poison; when the path splits there is a single Shadow patrolling each tunnel and both paths lead to the same cave. There are two Shadows warming themselves by a fire with a cooking pot, there is a chest beside the fire, and a Corundum Ore vein to the west. The door leads to a circular tower room; at the bottom there is an alchemy lab, and a random potion. Hanging above the lab is a dried Elves Ear and a dried Frost Mirriam. A bandit patrols between the room and the next stairs, and another one is sitting at the far end of the tunnel. There is an adept-level chest on the other side of the wall that the lab is on. The room to the right contains the Summerset Shadows banner, and when approached will give you the option of burning it, which can be done using a fire spell. Doing so will alert any remaining enemies, so leave it until after they are dead if you want to remain hidden. There is a door to either side of the banner. The room to the left contains two Shadows, one awake and one sleeping, a knapsack, and a leveled potion. The other room contains the Shadows' boss, Linwe, a bed to the left, the One-handed skill book Mace Etiquette on the shelves opposite the end of the bed, and a boss chest to the right. Linwe is instantly hostile to you and, when dead, you can loot his body for the locket, some leveled weapons, and his armor, boots, gloves and hood. There is no quick way out so you must retrace your steps back outside and return to Torsten. Alternatively you can sneak all the way to Linwe and steal the Locket, staying true to the Thieves Guild code of not killing its targets, though you should be warned that Linwe has a very high detection level. After taking the locket, the quest updates as if Linwe had been killed. The game still reports the Summerset Shadows as being overthrown, even if you haven't killed anyone.  Burning the banner is still possible if you have a high sneak perk. Distract Linwe and the other Summerset Shadows to stay at a distance while you burn it, and hide immediately after. Message Delivered[edit] Return to Torsten in Windhelm and return his heirloom. He'll reward you with a leveled item, and offer his support to the Guild. Report back to Delvin. He'll give you your pay, and will compliment you on your actions and point out that the added infamy you earned the guild has attracted a new merchant to The Ragged Flagon."

Kill Karstaag.","Karstaag's skull in Glacial Cave Karstaag's skull placed on his throne The Glacial Cave is very simple, containing only three Rieklings. Karstaag's skull is in the wall at the very back of the cave with torches around it. After traveling to the ruins of Castle Karstaag, there are two ways to reach the courtyard: You can either pick the master-level lock on the front gate, or take the long route through the Castle Karstaag Caverns, a large Riekling cave. The cave crisscrosses the main cavern multiple times and there are Rieklings on every level. Once you get to the courtyard, you will see a large throne. Place the skull here. Be prepared for a very difficult fight. Once you place the skull, back up. Karstaag will appear as a ghostly frost giant with horns and a permanent ice cloak. When he appears he will cause a massive explosion of ice that looks like a blizzard which will hang around a while and take up a large area. Karstaag fights like a regular giant but hits a lot harder. He can summon three ice wraiths at any time in the fight and he can do it multiple times. He is a very powerful foe and can kill poorly-equipped characters rapidly. When you defeat Karstaag, you will gain the power to Summon Karstaag, but only three times and only outside. You can also loot Karstaag for ten samples of ectoplasm and a few soul gems."

Return to the Jarl of Riften.","Locate The Suppliers[edit] After you have read the letter you will need to return to the jarl. When you tell her that you have discovered the location of the skooma traders, she will ask that they ""be destroyed once and for all"", and entice you with the prospect of a title in Riften. This prompts an update of the quest to find the cave. The cave is north of Riften, and northeast of Shor's Stone. There is a single bandit and two pit wolves outside the cave. The wolves should be inside the two level-locked cages, but are sometimes found roaming the small camp. Disruption[edit] Cragslane Cavern Guard The wolf pit of Cragslane Cavern Enter the cave to find a bandit standing guard near a lit lantern; after you ignore the warnings, or get too close, you will be attacked. Further down the tunnel and around the corner is the main gathering room of the suppliers. There are three gamblers, a barkeep, and a pit wolf in the first part, and a bandit, and two pit wolves locked in cages, in the second part. Loot the barkeep for the Craglane chest key, and the second bandit for the Craglane dog cage key. Go behind the bar in the northwestern corner to find a leveled apprentice-locked chest, a bowl of moon sugar, two bottles of skooma, and a copy of the Lockpicking skill book The Wolf Queen, v1. The second part of the cave contains another leveled apprentice-locked chest with a bear trap in front of it, the two apprentice-locked wolf cages, and spread over the preparation area, a few ingredients, a bowl of moon sugar and seven bottles of skooma. There is also a set of miner's clothes, which are rare to find lying loose. A Reward Well Earned[edit] After two quests involving two fights, one of which descends into a large brawl, you have well earned a reward. Return to the jarl and she will reward you with a random enchanted weapon, and express her gratefulness, ""Your continued efforts have been of great benefit to the people of Riften."" Additionally, if Maven Black-Briar is jarl, then following the eradication of the bandits in Cragslane Cavern, she will send her people to gather any remaining merchandise because ""We can't have that substance falling into the wrong hands now, can we?"" She will also reward you with some gold, stating that ""this should suffice as your cut of the... or rather, a reward for your actions."""

Make you look completely different. Do you believe that?"" Your quest journal will update with the objective to locate the face sculptor. Your map will not be updated with a quest marker, but if you travel to Riften, a guard will make a negative comment about the face sculptor, conveniently providing her location: ""Take my advice, don't listen to that talk of the ""face sculptor"" down in the Ragged Flagon. ""Face butcher"" is more like it from what I've heard."" Make your way to the Ragged Flagon, located within Riften's sewer network and accessible through the Ratway. Sitting alone on a bench is Galathil, the face sculptor you're seeking. Upon approaching her, she'll speak to you before you can say a word: ""Hmm, I suppose I can work with your face. After all, the sculptor cannot always choose the finest clay."" If you are a vampire, however, she will be able to tell and instead say, ""What have you done to yourself? I can't work with you in this state, night-walker."" You can ask her what she's talking about, or tell her you've already heard of her. Either way, she will subtly insult you, by implying that your appearance is not ""artful"" or referring to you as the ""scum of Skyrim"". She will then check to see if you are a client, asking ""So are you here as a client? Shall I remake your face?"" unless you are a vampire, in which case she'll tell you ""But, my techniques only work on the living, not those that have crossed over into undeath."" At this point, you can choose to have your appearance changed, back out, or question her qualifications. If you tell her you'll have to think about it, she'll respond, ""Indeed. It is no small thing to submit yourself to the flesh sculptor's knife."" and begin to read a book. You are still able to approach her again with the same options if you do this. If you question her, she'll answer defensively, telling you how experienced she is: ""I have not always been a ragged beggar. I learned my art from the masters of the art of flesh sculpture. I studied with the Faculty of Chirurgeons in Cloudrest. I walked with the Hollow-Faced Men of Nohotogrha for three years. I count the nobility of both the Empire and the Dominion among my clients"", and then angrily add ""And yet, I have fallen so low that I must justify myself to a wanderer in the sewers of this backwater of the world."" If you decide you would like her to change your appearance, it costs 1000 gold. If you can afford it, she'll say, ""Hmm. Very well. Just tell me what you desire - beauty or hideous deformity, nothing is beyond my skill"", but if you don't have enough gold, she'll be offended and dismiss you: ""Despite my present low estate, I am no beggar. Begone until you have the coin to warrant my skills."" When you pay her the gold, you will enter a screen nearly identical to the initial character creation option from beginning your game. You can change almost all aspects of your appearance, the only exceptions being your character's race or sex. There is no limit to the amount of times you can repeat this quest.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Take_Up_Arms","Locate the headquarters of the Companions. Find and talk to Kodlak Whitemane. Prove yourself worthy against Vilkas. Make yourself useful to the higher-ranked members.","Find the Companions[edit] On your way to Whiterun, you may come across members of the Companions, specifically Aela the Huntress, Ria, and Farkas, battling a giant among the sparse crops outside Pelagia Farm. If you want to participate in this fight, make sure to head straight to the farm once you arrive in the vicinity of Whiterun. If you delay for even a short time, the Companions will have already defeated the giant before you can join the fray, resulting in Aela taunting you for your lack of assistance. If you delay for too long, you may miss the Companions entirely, as they will slowly walk to the main gates of Whiterun and enter the city after the battle. Note that neither of these results has any negative consequences in your dealings with the Companions. If you are present when the giant dies, Aela will actively seek you out and will, depending on the outcome of the battle, either commend or taunt your battle skills. In both cases, however, she will tell you about the Companions and point you towards Kodlak Whitemane in Jorrvaskr. This quest can also be started by speaking with select Whiterun citizens or Jorrvaskr residents, who will suggest you go speak with Kodlak. Jorrvaskr[edit] Jorrvaskr is a legendary mead hall and the oldest building in Whiterun; it is located in the Wind District, up the eastern set of stairs from the Gildergreen. Inside the building, you will witness a friendly brawl between newcomers Athis and Njada Stonearm while the other members cheer. The harbinger of the Companions, Kodlak Whitemane, will most likely be in the northern room of the Living Quarters, busy talking to Vilkas about what seem to be important matters. When asked about membership, Kodlak will consider you worthy, while Vilkas will disagree. After a brief argument between the two, Kodlak will ask about your battle skills. Regardless of your answer, Kodlak will order Vilkas to escort you to the yard for a quick sparring session. Follow Vilkas to the yard and pick up the fight. Make sure not to use magic, a bound weapon, or an enchanted weapon, for if you do Vilkas will temporarily stop the session. If you only have enchanted weapons, unequip them and use your fists. Take a few swings at Vilkas and prove your worth. Once Vilkas asks you to stop, accept your status as a 'whelp' and the fact that you will run errands for now. A Few Errands[edit] Vilkas will hand you his sword for sharpening. Take it to the best smith in town, Eorlund Gray-Mane, who works at the Skyforge just up the stairs from the Jorrvaskr entrance. Eorlund will briefly explain how newcomers tend to get bossed around upon joining the Companions, and will then ask for a favor. He will give you a shield for Aela, who can be found talking to Skjor in the living quarters. Similar to the conversation between Kodlak and Vilkas, it becomes apparent that the Companions hide a few secrets, although none of them will share them with you at this time. When you hand Aela the shield, she will thank you for the favor and summon Farkas to escort you to your new quarters, where a free bed will be available. Farkas will introduce you to a few of the other newcomers and will also offer you a job, which will be one of his radiant quests. You can choose to ignore his request, as seven different radiant quests will now be available from the guild members, and you must complete at least one of them before your next major assignment, Proving Honor.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Taking_Care_of_Business","Speak to Brynjolf in the Ragged Flagon. Collect the debts: Keerava Bersi Honey-Hand Haelga Return to Brynjolf.","There's More Where That Came From[edit] Brynjolf tells you to meet him in the Ragged Flagon underneath Riften if you're interested in more lucrative operations like the one he arranged earlier. The only way to reach the Thieves Guild headquarters at this point is through the Ratway. The entrance is through an inconspicuous gate on the lower level of Riften. You'll have to fight or avoid several enemies; more detail on what you'll encounter is below. Ratway walkthrough →Down some stairs and at the end of the corridor are Drahff and Hewnon Black-Skeever, two lowlifes who will be discussing some kind of plot to undermine the Guild. They will both attack on sight. If you wish to sneak past them, keep in mind that when their conversation ends, Hewnon will crouch by the fire with his back to you, and Drahff will begin patrolling the corridor between Hewnon and the entrance. Take a right into a room with a bedroll, and then another right to a two-level room with a raised drawbridge directly across from you. The ""correct"" way to go about this would be to jump down to the lower level, but if you know Whirlwind Sprint, you can use it to skip the dungeon. Use the shout to get across the gap to the right of the drawbridge, where there is a small space of ledge under the railing that you can land on. You can then just jump onto and over the railing where you'll be in the last room of the dungeon. If you went to the lower level, there's also a gate to the left which can be a shortcut to the final room if you are proficient in picking expert-level locks; if not, you'll have to take the long way around. The ""scenic"" route is full of traps, but there's a unique item as well. Southwest of the expert-locked gate is a short corridor ending in a brazier and a door. Opening it without disabling the tension cable on the bottom right side will make two spears shoot out from the wall to the left. Beyond is a room with an oil slick on the floor and a lantern above. The south door leads onward to a room with five bear traps scattered near the entrance. Gian the Fist, who has the Gloves of the Pugilist, is across the room and will attack on sight. Beware, as his detection level is very high; he will probably sense you and attack even if you have a high Sneak skill. The gloves may be useful later during this quest if you choose to brawl anyone. There's also an alchemy lab in the alcove to the left. In the next room, go up the stairs, watching out for the pressure plate and corresponding battering ram that will hit you in the back if you're not careful. After this, a gate opens up to circular room overgrown with plants. In the center is a wood chopping block with an iron battleaxe stuck in it. Turn north again and you'll be in the last room which contains a hostile lowlife and a skeever. Be sure to drop the drawbridge via the lever for future ease of access, and pick up the Pickpocket skill book Beggar from the table. The door to the Ragged Flagon is to the east. The Thieves Guild headquarters is rather run-down, and as you circle around the shallow pool to the bar proper, you'll overhear a conversation about the sorry state of affairs: ""I wasn't certain I'd ever see you again!"" Vekel the Man: Give it up, Brynjolf... those days are over. Brynjolf: I'm telling you, this one is different... Dirge: We've all heard that one before, Bryn! Quit kidding yourself. Vekel: It's time to face the truth, old friend. You, Vex, Mercer... you're all part of a dying breed. Things are changing! Brynjolf: Dying breed, eh? Well what do you call that then! At this point Brynjolf will turn around and, if you are close enough, approach to say, ""Well, well... Color me impressed lad/lass. I wasn't certain I'd ever see you again!"" And you'll have three options. If you say that you got through the Ratway easily, he will be doubly impressed, saying, ""Reliable and headstrong? You're turning out to be quite the prize!"" If you claim you nearly died or point out the less-than-lovely state of the Guild, he will be annoyed, saying, ""No risk, no reward. That's the way it goes, so you better get used to it."" or ""If you were expecting a palace, then maybe you're not cut out for this line of work. Our methods involve secrecy and discretion."", respectively. In any case, he will then go on to ask if you're up to ""handling a few deadbeats"" for him. ""They owe our organization some serious coin and they've decided not to pay. I want you to explain to them the error of their ways,"" Brynjolf will explain, then tell you who they are at your inquiry: ""Keerava, Bersi Honey-Hand and Haelga. Do this right, and I can promise you a permanent place in our organization."" After Brynjolf tells you to get going, the quest will update with the three debts to recover. You can head topside immediately (you'll have to go back through the Ratway), but it also pays to stay a bit longer and ask Brynjolf about the marks. His dialogue will reveal weaknesses to exploit for each: Keerava has a soft spot for family, Bersi has a priceless - and fragile - urn, and Haelga has her devotion to Dibella, goddess of beauty. The debts may be collected in any order you choose, but keep in mind that after you have two debtors in line, the last - whomever that may be - will cave immediately, having heard how you dealt with the others. Keerava's Debt[edit] Keerava runs Riften's only inn, the Bee and Barb, next to the market. Once inside, you'll find her behind the bar, tending to her patrons. Tell her you have a message from Brynjolf and she will say ""I'll already told that buffoon I'm not paying you people a single coin!"" When you say it wasn't a request, she'll be stubborn. ""Look around you, I'm barely keeping this rathole together. The war's seen to that."" You'll have two options now. You can either brawl with her to collect the debt, or you can try the route that Brynjolf suggested if you talked to him. Find Talen-Jei, another Argonian in the tavern, who is Keerava's lover. He will be suspicious of you, but if you tell him to talk some sense into her, he will say, ""With the rumors going around about how poorly your Guild's been doing, she's become much too bold. I'm not that foolish. The last thing I want is a war with your people."" If you ask for his cooperation, you will have it. ""Look, I'm only telling you this because I care for her. Don't mistake this as acceptance for what you do. Keerava has some family at a farm just inside of Morrowind. If you mention you know about it, she might just listen to you. Just please, don't harm anyone. I couldn't bear the thought."" Return to Keerava and she will give up the money, petrified with fear. If you return to Brynjolf after receiving Keerava's payment, but before finishing all three debtors, you can offer him Keerava's payment on its own, to which he will respond ""She was the toughest of the bunch. Honestly, I'm amazed she didn't kick you out of the Bee and Barb herself."" If Keerava is the last debtor you collect from, she will instead say, ""Look, everything was all just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to tell Brynjolf to go jump off the pier. You'll tell him I said sorry, yes? Take this. Every single coin I owe is there, I swear it."" Bersi's Debt[edit] Bersi's priceless urn Bersi Honey-Hand is the owner of the Pawned Prawn general store, to the west of the Bee and Barb. He's usually behind the counter, with his precious Dwemer Urn sitting on a cabinet right across from him. Tell him that you have a message, and he will be disgusted. ""Wha... what? Oh, it's one of you people. So, Brynjolf doesn't even bother to show up himself anymore, eh? What's this message?"" The two options presented lead to different dialogue: ""Petty threats and fist waving are not going to sway me. You people are all talk, and everyone knows it! Pay you to protect me? You can't even protect yourselves!"" if you threaten him and ""You're gouging me for what little coin I make and you can't even protect yourselves? Ridiculous!"" if you say he knows what it is. The end result is the same; either walk away, or brawl. If you're not up to fisticuffs with him, though, you can always duke it out with the urn. It's across from Bersi, ready for the smashing. Take out your weapon or spell (it will take a few hits to break it, so you may not want to use a bow) and get to it. Bersi and his wife Drifa will yell out as you do, but once the urn is shattered beyond repair Bersi will say ""No! That urn was priceless!"" Ask him if he wants you to break anything else, and he will pay you: ""All right! I get it. I'll pay on time from now on. Just don't smash anything else. Here, take your gold and leave me in peace."" If you return to Brynjolf after receiving Bersi's payment, but before finishing all three debtors, you can offer him Bersi's payment on its own, to which he will respond ""I wasn't sure that he'd see the light, but I'm sure you ""explained"" it to him. Well done!"" If Bersi is the last one you visit, he will say ""Oh! There's no need for that. I know why you're here. Tell Brynjolf not to worry about it anymore. Oh! And look, I even have the payment I owed. Here, take it."" Haelga's Debt[edit] Haelga runs the eponymous Bunkhouse, north of the Bee and Barb. She is dismissive of you from the get-go, saying ""If you're looking for a room, try the Bee and Barb. This place is for the working man."" Tell her you have a message from Brynjolf and she will say ""What does he want now? I already explained to him that you can't get blood from a stone."" Now you can either brawl, or come at the problem from another angle. Around the corner to the east is a set of drawers, upon which sits a golden statue of Dibella, Divine of beauty, to whom Haelga is devoted. Swipe it and go back to Haelga. Threaten to drop the statue down a well and she will crack: ""Not Lady Dibella? No, please! I can't lose her! I get the message. Here, take your gold. I hope you choke on it!"" If you return to Brynjolf after receiving Haelga's payment, but before finishing all three debtors, you can offer him Haelga's payment on its own, to which he will respond ""She's as stubborn as she is beautiful, isn't she? Glad you found a way to get her to pay."" If Haelga is last, she will be afraid: ""I know who you are. You've been terrorizing the entire city. Please, there's no need for that here. Message understood. Here, I even have the payment!"" Bring Home the Bacon[edit] When you return to him (once again through the Ratway), Brynjolf will have different sets of dialogue depending on whether any of the three died, and whether you still have the gold you were sent to collect. If you don't have enough gold, and at least one is dead, whether killed by you or not: ""You have wax in your ears? I said no one dies. We're not assassins. Well guess what... now you've inherited their debt. Don't come back to me until you have every last coin."" If you don't have enough gold, but everyone is alive: ""So I've heard. Thanks to you, this should be the last time they forget to pay. One small detail though - I need all of the gold they gave you. No one skims around here. Come back when you've got every last coin."" You will have to acquire the remainder yourself. Once you do have enough gold, you can proceed. If one or more are dead: ""Are you daft? I told you not kill any of them. How much clearer do you need me to be? How about the gold? Did you remember to bring it or is that too difficult an instruction as well."" Confirm it's all there and he will continue, still angry, ""I suppose it's not a total loss then. Let me give you a piece of advice. If you want to make some serious coin in this business you need to listen to rules. Now, on to other things."" If all are alive: ""So, job's done and you even brought the gold. Best of all you did it clean. I like that. Dumping bodies and keeping the guards quiet can be expensive."" Hand over the gold and he will say, ""Well done. And it would seem I owe you something in return. Here you go, I think you'll find these quite useful."" He will hand you a nice bonus of three potions: one poison, one potion of fortify health, and one fortifying a random stealth skill. Ask him what's next and he will continue: ""Despite your mistakes, I see more potential in you than half the snot-nosed footpads that stumble their way into the Flagon. I'm going to put my neck on the line. We need people like you in our outfit."" or ""Judging from how well you handled those shopkeepers, I'd say you've done more than simply prove yourself. We need people like you in our outfit."" Regardless, when you show interest at more gold, he will say, ""That's the spirit! Larceny's in your blood... the telltale sign of a practiced thief. I think you'll do more than just fit in around here."" You can ask him about the rumors - that the Guild is in dire straits - and he will be dismissive: ""We've run into a rough patch lately, but it's nothing to be concerned about. Tell you what. You keep making us coin and I'll worry about everything else. Fair enough?"" Reply ""fair enough"" and he will get the show on the road. ""Now if there are no more questions, how about following me and I'll show you what we're all about."" This will end Taking Care of Business and start the next quest, Loud and Clear. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked at the end of this quest: Taking Care of Business (10 points/Bronze)"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Taste_of_Death","Investigate the desecration of the Hall of the Dead in Markarth. Clear Reachcliff Cave of undead. Bring a fresh kill to Namira's Shrine. Do the unthinkable for your reward.","City of Stone[edit] ""What are you hiding, priest?"" Markarth is the capital city of the Reach, a place of misfortune and decay, and the denizens rarely talk to strangers about anything but the endless problems with the natives of the Reach, the Forsworn. Fortunately, the innkeeper at the Silver-Blood Inn will happily share a few local rumors when asked, so enter the tavern near the main gate and find Kleppr (or Frabbi if her husband is dead) behind the bar. One of the rumors may reveal problems with the local Hall of the Dead, which has been closed for unknown reasons. You are told to see Brother Verulus for further information, thus starting the objective that eventually leads to this quest. If Kleppr or Frabbi refuse to talk about the hall, you can find Brother Verulus yourself, who will openly tell you about current events. Inside Understone Keep you will witness a heated argument between Verulus and Thongvor Silver-Blood: Thongvor: ""What are you hiding, priest?"" Verulus: ""I'm not hiding anything. It's closed for a reason."" Thongvor: ""Typical Imperial lies. First you take away Talos, now you're keeping us from seeing our honored dead? You and the Jarl will answer for any desecration of my ancestors' bodies."" Verulus: ""That's enough, Thongvor. We're done."" After the conversation, talk to Verulus and he will deny you access to the hall and will provide a standard explanation. You can attempt to bribe, persuade, or intimidate him, although only the first two options will get you anywhere.  To succeed at bribery or persuasion, you will need to pass an easy Speech check. Option  Dialogue  Reaction   I could help if you tell me. (Persuade) Passed: All right. I was going to suggest the Jarl hire someone to sort this mess out, anyway. Passed: Investigate the Hall of the Dead   Would some coin help? (Bribe) Passed: Well, the Priesthood of Arkay always accepts generous donations.Failed: That's not going to work. Passed: Investigate the Hall of the DeadFailed: Nothing   I don't like being ignored. (Intimidate) Failed: Then my answer is the Hall of the Dead is closed. By order of the Jarl. Understand? Failed: Nothing   I'll come back later, then. Arkay keep you and protect you. Nothing He will then explain the macabre situation in the hall and reveal the truth: ""We've discovered that some of the dead have been... eaten. Flesh has been chewed off, bones were snapped to get at the marrow inside."" Verulus then proceeds to ask you to investigate the Hall of the Dead and hands you the key to the hall. This is the beginning of the favor quest. Alternatively, you can completely ignore Verulus and pick the lock to the hall. Entering the hall this way will trigger the main quest; however, unless you persuade or bribe him, you will not be able to befriend him using the favor quest. Hall of the Dead[edit] Eola in the Hall of the Dead Moments after entering, a female voice will echo through the hall, saying, ""Not many would walk blindly into a crypt, smelling of steel and blood, but not fear. I feel the hunger inside of you. Gnawing at you. You see the dead and your mouth grows wet. Your stomach growls. It's all right. I will not shun you for what you are. Stay. I will tell you everything you have forgotten."" After the speech, Eola will then run up to you and continue in the same vein, trying to seduce you with suggestions and accusations. When she is finished, three options are available. If you choose the third option, the quest will immediately fail, as she will attack you, with no option to yield. You can still complete the favor quest and receive your reward from Verulus, but will never get to experience The Taste of Death. If you instead pick any of the two other options, Eola will continue her seductive behavior, eventually mentioning the Lady of Decay, Namira, and a so-called safe haven for cannibals like yourself. Regardless of your answer, the quest will start. If you ask her about the place, she will mark Reachcliff Cave on your map and reveal the truth about the desecration of the hall. Recently, the cave itself saw the dead rise from their graves, forcing Eola to flee and live in the hall and feast on its more passive inhabitants. She will task you with clearing the cave, and will then cast her invisibility spell, asking you to meet her at the cave entrance. She will also assure you that the hall will see no further disturbances, and will then leave. Go talk to Brother Verulus and tell him the good news. He will be quite happy, hand you his Amulet of Arkay as a reward and return to his duties inside the hall. This completes the favor quest. Cave of the Dead[edit] ""Bring Verulus here. The Lady of Decay will do the rest."" Reachcliff Cave is located east and slightly south of Markarth and can easily be reached by crossing the bridge to the south from Karthspire. As promised, Eola will be waiting for you near the entrance and will seek you out as you approach. She will reveal that the opposition inside the cave consists of draugr enemies and the whole cave has to be cleared. You can choose to have her as a follower, so decide whether or not to accept her offer and head inside. Watch out for the higher-leveled draugr in the second chamber and carefully proceed forward. Eola is a powerful follower and will not hesitate to summon a flame atronach or revive defeated draugr for extra help. In the catacombs, take a left for a difficult jump to a chest on a small ledge. (Use Whirlwind Sprint for an effortless little zoom across the gap). After a short trek, you will arrive in a room with several draugr, including the boss, so dispose of them all and take a look around; the chamber consists of a huge dinner table, and, in the southern end, the very altar of Namira. Eola will now approach and thank you for reclaiming the Shrine, and will ask you to bring in a fresh kill for your initiation into the coven, specifically a priest filled with the taste of the easy life, Brother Verulus. She will then hand you 100 gold to cover expenses and show you the way out. A shortcut to the outside world will now have opened in the room next to the Shrine, so exit the cave and travel to Markarth. Champion of Namira[edit] Back in the Hall of the Dead, the unsuspecting priest has picked up his daily routines and spends most of his time sweeping or praying near the Shrine of Arkay, convinced that everything is all right. Talk to him and ask him for assistance during your travels. In order to get him to follow, you need to pass a speech check. As with the initial conversation with him about investigating the hall, only the first two options will get you anywhere. (However, persuading may be impossible, necessitating a bribe—see Bugs.) Option  Dialogue  Reaction   There would be treasure to share... (Persuade) Passed: Treasure, you say? I suppose the Jarl won't mind if I'm gone for a little while. Lead on.Failed: You know, in the Priesthood of Arkay, we have a joke about an empty pocket being better than a full grave. Passed: Return to Namira's ShrineFailed: Nothing   I'm willing to pay. (Bribe) Passed: That's no small amount of coin, friend. I suppose I can come with you for a short venture. Lead on.Failed: I'm just not up for it, sorry. I'd rather stay here, have a glass of wine, and perform my rites to Arkay in peace. Passed: Return to Namira's ShrineFailed: Nothing   You're coming with me. Now. (Intimidate) Failed: I think you need to calm down before I summon the guards. Failed: Nothing   Never mind, then. Arkay watch over you. Nothing Leave the Hall of the Dead and fast travel to the secret back entrance to Reachcliff Cave. When you enter the dining hall, you will find several well-known Markarth citizens seated at the large table, all hungry and ready for the evening feast: Lisbet, Banning, Hogni Red-Arm, Sanyon, and Nimphaneth. The table will be set with beverages, bread, cheese and two pieces of human flesh. A confused Brother Verulus will approach the table, stuttering. Eola will immediately be over him and will use her seductive charms to make him forget where he is and feel incredibly tired. She will then proceed to invite him to take a rest on the altar in front of the Shrine of Namira, something he will do right away. Listening to the guests' private conversations makes it quite clear what they're all waiting for: the flesh of Verulus. Head to the altar where Eola will invite you to start carving the sleeping priest in front of you. Death of a priest At this point, you can choose to kill Eola, which will net you a leveled amount of gold from a grateful Brother Verulus and a fight against all the dinner guests, including the quest-related Lisbet, dog seller Banning and Markarth market merchant Hogni Red-Arm. Killing Eola will cause the quest to fail. Slay the sleeping priest in cold blood, which will make an excited Eola invite you to have the very first bite. Examine the dead priest and choose the option 'eat'. You will then be treated to an animation of yourself feasting on the still warm body of Verulus, and Namira will finally speak to you from her realm. ""Mortal. I am Namira, the Lady of Decay. Your consumption of the blood and bile of Arkay's own is pleasing to me. I give you my ring. Wear it, and when you feast on the flesh of the dead I will grant you my power."" You will then receive the Ring of Namira which increases your stamina by 50 points and allows you to feed on corpses for increased health and health regeneration of 50 points for 5 minutes. Eola will then welcome you to the coven and will be available as a follower should you ever need her. When all is said and done, leave the cannibals to their feast and head out into Skyrim.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Telrav%27s_Request","Speak to Telrav. Escort him to his camp in Nilheim. Kill Telrav and his men.","While passing by Nilheim, you will see a man sitting by the side of the road next to an overturned cart. He will hail you as you approach: ""Bandits attacked and ransacked my cart. Can you help me?"" The man, Telrav, will ask you to escort him to his camp, which he says is just across the bridge in Nilheim. You can refuse at this point; should you agree to help him, Telrav will stand up and walk—with surprising energy for a man who has just been attacked and left for dead—across the bridge to Nilheim. Once you are across the bridge, however, Telrav will reveal himself. He will stand at the stairs and address the gathered bandits: ""Looks like we've got ourselves another fool."" He's led you into an ambush! Telrav will attack you along with a swarm of leveled bandits. Telrav himself shouldn't be much of a problem, as he is relatively weak and wears only ordinary clothes. The other bandits may prove a bit challenging. After Telrav and his crew have been dealt with, you are free to loot any of the bodies and containers in the fort—including Telrav, who will sometimes have several hundred septims on his corpse. Alternatively, you may bypass Telrav when he is on the road and proceed into Nilheim, where the bandits will be disguised as guards. If you kill them all and go talk to Telrav, when he walks across the bridge he will yell ""My men? What did you do? You'll die for this."" and attack you alone."

He will give you an extractor, and ask you to obtain an ash sample from an ash spawn as he is working on a spell to summon them. He will inform you that the ash sample can only be extracted from a dead ash spawn, but remains confident in your ability to ""bring it about."" Find and kill any ash spawn. The wall outside Raven Rock should have plenty of ash spawn if you haven't already completed March of the Dead. Note that you can still extract the sample from the remains of an ash spawn killed prior to starting the quest, so if you have recently completed March of the Dead, you'll likely still be able to find their remains outside of the city walls. Searching the corpse of an ash spawn should bring up the option to use the extractor. After using it, return to Neloth for you reward. The spell tome Conjure Ash Spawn should be available for sale from Talvas Fathryon a day or so after completion of the quest."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Temple_of_Miraak","Travel to the Temple of Miraak. Find and talk to Frea. Enter the temple and travel through it. Read the Black Book Waking Dreams at the end of the temple.","Here in His Temple[edit] When you reach the Temple of Miraak you will find that the exterior is under construction by the enthralled people of Solstheim, all of them forced by Miraak to rebuild the temple. You may also notice that you are not the only unenslaved person around, as Skaal resident, Frea, will be attempting to contact the mindless builders. Enter the center of the structure and the quest will begin with Frea seeking you out. She explains that she is there to either free or avenge her people, revealing that the workers are from her village. She is also knowledgeable about the return of Miraak and will offer you companionship to help defeat him. Her assistance starts with locating the entrance to the underground Temple. Soon afterward, a gate will open and two cultists will come rushing out, revealing the entrance. Dispose of them and follow Frea into the temple. Temple of Miraak[edit] Frea waits until the path is clear. Go through the first corridor and check the neighboring rooms for a few healing potions and a chest with minor loot. Proceed north until you reach a room with a pressure plate that triggers darts. Two cultists will attack as well, but Frea will quickly show that she is a capable warrior and kill them on the spot. There is a restless draugr in the upright sarcophagus on the left-hand raised section in this room. There is also a dead (lootable) draugr in the sarcophagus on the right-hand side. These do not seem to emerge unless you climb onto the relevant raised section of floor. More pressure plates can be found in the next room, both of them triggering battering rams. Avoid them and head west. Pull the lever to open the gate into what appears to be a torture-showroom, with several skeletons in cages and a throne that provides a good view of the mayhem. Frea will spot something near the throne but reckons it's impossible to reach. The task is of course left to you. Next to the broken stairs, jump onto the overturned pillar and from there, jump down to the platform and the throne. Claim the contents from the boss-leveled chest and jump back down. As you approach the bloody steps underneath the cages, a boss-leveled draugr will break out of his sarcophagus and attack. When walking down the stairs, more cultists will show up. Finish the fights and continue forward. Activate the handle to gain access to the northeastern tunnel and fight the draugr who resides there. When you reach another pressure plate and a swinging blades trap, you will be attacked on all sides by leveled draugr. The path now splits, but both paths will land you in the same catacombs with quick access to a huge chamber protected by yet another pressure plate triggering flame spouts. In the chamber, quite a few swinging blades will activate. Frea will order you to solve the problem, and even make herself comfortable while she waits. The blades' area of effect is easily avoided by simply hugging the walls of the chamber, though you can also just dodge them, by waiting for a second of space to pass through unarmed quickly, or by using the shouts; Become Ethereal, or Whirlwind Sprint. Stop the traps by activating the handle on the other side of the room and Frea will come walking up to you. Head through the door with her and face a closed iron gate. The adjacent window reveals a handle, so make your way there and activate it. There is also a chain in the room behind the gate that reveals a chamber with a chest. Behind the gate is another huge chamber, and several raised wooden bridges will fall into place when you enter. Two leveled draugr and a cultist will be waiting to the south. Dispose of them all and enter the Sanctum. Sanctum[edit] The Gatekeeper attacks. The path ahead is quite narrow and leads onto a bridge where you will encounter at least six skeletons. Next up are several draugr bursting out of their coffins, along with more pressure plates triggering battering rams. You will now be in the chamber you just crossed on the bridge. To the right is a passage leading to a room with several potions, coin purses, and two spell tomes: an apprentice level Alteration and an apprentice level Conjuration spell tome. Take what you want and return to the huge room where you will encounter more draugr and cultists. Head around the pit in the center of the room and go west. Before long, you will hear the easily recognizable chant from a word wall in the room ahead. The room contains both the word wall and a provocative trophy, hung there by Miraak as a symbol of his superiority. While Frea comments on this, go and learn the first word for the Dragon Aspect shout (or the second, if you have already learned the first word in Raven Rock Mine). This will cause numerous draugr to attack, including the unique Gatekeeper. After the battle, search the Gatekeeper for the temple key then find his sarcophagus on the western wall and unlock the door behind it. It opens to a macabre dining table, the skeletal guests still in their seats. Behind the table is a tunnel leading to a larger dining area with a kitchen behind. When you reach the kitchen, Frea will realize it is a dead end and will order you to have a look around while she backtracks to the dining area. The kitchen contains an alchemy lab, a few potions and ingredients, and most importantly, a path in the southeastern corner leading to a handle. When activated, a hidden door in the dining area will open up. In the next chamber, Frea will hint that there may be something in there that fills in the holes in the story of Miraak, and will head into the next room and gaze at the statues. Similar to her actions back in the trapped room, she will ask you to activate the button while she waits at a safe distance. The handle removes the grate in the floor and reveals a wooden staircase going down. Head down and follow the path to another set of stairs. Proceed through two empty rooms until you find a handle lowering the rock wall. Continue down yet more stairs and open the door. A huge chamber will be revealed, guarded by draugr and skeletons, and booby-trapped with tripwires triggering falling boulders. Make your way to the top and face a boss-leveled draugr, being sure to loot the chest behind his sarcophagus. Activate the chain on the southern wall and follow the serpentine path until you reach your target, a pedestal holding a Black Book, Waking Dreams. Waking Dreams[edit] ""Who are you to dare set foot here?"" When you read the Black Book, dark tentacles will reach out of the book's pages and grab you. You will be transported to a strange realm just in time to see a dragon arrive. Nearby are a few seekers standing guard and Miraak himself. You will be unable to move and can do nothing but listen to Miraak's monologue: ""Who are you to dare set foot here? Ahh... You are Dragonborn. I can feel it. And yet..."" At this point his dialogue will differ depending on your progress of the main quest (see notes). After the conditional comment he will continue, ""You have no idea of the true power a Dragonborn can wield!"" He will then demonstrate the Dragon Aspect shout. ""Mul... Qah Diiv! This realm is beyond you. You have no power here. And it is only a matter of time before Solstheim is also mine. I already control the minds of its people. Soon they will finish building my temple, and I can return home."" He will then turn to the four seekers and say: ""Send him/her back where he/she came from. He/She can await my arrival with the rest of Tamriel."" The seekers will then shower you with magic and while you slowly lose consciousness, you can see Miraak mount the dragon and fly away. Moments later, you will be back in the Sanctum and Frea will demand an explanation. As soon as she realizes the potential danger of the situation, she will suggest that you follow her to her village and talk to her father, Storn Crag-Strider. This ends the quest and begins the next in line, The Fate of the Skaal. Since the Black Book is an inventory item, you may re-read it at any time, and explore it more thoroughly in Miraak's absence, all the way up to getting the second (or third) word of the Dragon Aspect shout: however you will not be able to unlock the final part of the book until the concluding part of the Main Quest, when you *must* return here. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: The Temple of Miraak (20 points/Bronze)"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Tending_the_Flames","Locate the Bards College. Learn about the Festival and Jarl Elisif the Fair's plan to cancel it. Travel to Dead Men's Respite to receive a missing Verse. Return to the Bards College and pay a visit to the Blue Palace. Participate in the Festival.","The Burning of King Olaf[edit] All over Skyrim, the Bards performing at the various inns and taverns will point you towards the Bards College in Solitude. When you enter the building, you will be greeted by Headmaster Viarmo; he will explain a bit about the college and will proceed to hand you a task as part of your application to join. He explains that the ancient college ritual The Burning of King Olaf has been canceled due to the recent assassination of High King Torygg. The grieving widow, the recently appointed Jarl of Solitude, Elisif the Fair reasons that burning a King in effigy is distasteful at this time and wants the festival shut down. The Festival itself is centuries old and is, according to Viarmo, held to celebrate Solitude and the heroic acts of the mythical King Olaf who apparently slew Numinex, a fearsome dragon who terrorized Skyrim during the First Era. The Poetic Edda[edit] To ease the mind of Elisif and thus save the Festival, Viarmo wants to recite King Olaf's Verse, originally a part of the Poetic Edda, but lost for thousands of years. The Poetic Edda is a living history of Skyrim, written by each bard studying at the College and as such, a precious item. King Olaf's Verse was Svaknir's contribution to the Edda and dared to question the heroic acts of King Olaf, the very King to whom the Festival is held. Because of the Verse, King Olaf sentenced Svaknir to death and all copies of the Verse burned. The residing Dean of History, Giraud Gemane, suspects that the lost Verse can be found inside Dead Men's Respite, which he also believes to be the burial tomb for King Olaf himself. Dead Men's Respite[edit] Locating the lost verse The ancient barrow is located in the mountains southwest of Morthal and you will, immediately upon entering, notice a strange ghost wave at you, then disappear through the sealed entrance to the north. Pick up the Ruby Dragon Claw from the table, which will cause four of the previously dead draugr enemies to reanimate and attack (you can kill them by sneak-attacking them before taking the claw), but will also raise the gate and allow you to follow the ghost. It soon becomes clear that the ghost shows you the correct path, so follow it and pull the chain at the dead end. The next area is a maze-like tomb where you will have to pull several chains to open up different areas. Use your map to your advantage and make sure to access the easternmost room for a copy of the Speech skill book The Buying Game, guarded by a well-placed Battering Ram. Watch out for several draugr and frostbite spiders and continue north. Beware of the pressure plate at the foot of the stairs, which will release a flame trap. Fight the spiders in the next room, loot the shelves for some potions and soul gems then pull the chain, which will open the grating in the floor and reveal a watery pit. Take the jump and proceed forward to a chamber with several enemies, including an archer on the ledge above. Proceed to the level above and open the gate, which will trigger several swinging blade traps (at the bottom-right corner of the gate you will find a trigger for the trap, which you can remove by picking the adept lock), so cross the bridge carefully and pull the chain to make them stop. Go up another level and open the huge door. The Executed Bard[edit] At the end of the next tunnel, use the Arcane Enchanter if you must, then turn around and watch your ghostly guide disappear through another doorway to the right. Due to a magical seal the door ahead of you is blocked, so make your way through the doorway to the right and through another set of catacombs to fight the residing draugr. The locked door hides a master-locked treasure chest, with a boss-leveled amount of gold. In the next chamber, the gate will shut behind you and five draugr will attack. After the battle, explore the southeastern room for a chest, but beware of the dart trap protecting it. Pull the chain and head down the path. Activate the handle and watch the rock wall lower and behold the sight of the ghost sitting next to the mummified corpse of Svaknir, the Bard executed for questioning the King in ancient times. You cannot interact with the ghost, but the corpse still holds the forbidden Verse, so claim it and learn the truth behind the annual Festival in Solitude. As soon as you take the Verse, the ghost disappears and you will have no choice but to backtrack through the Catacombs. Confront the King[edit] On your way back, you will encounter the Ghost of Svaknir near the magically sealed door. He will turn towards the door, break the barrier, and run headfirst into the Chamber. Follow Svaknir to a Nordic puzzle door; it is finally time to investigate the Ruby Dragon Claw you found when you initially entered the barrow, so take an extra look and you will find the symbols Wolf—Hawk—Wolf, so adjust the corresponding images for the three rings on the door, then insert the claw in the keyhole. Proceed forward and equip yourself for a lengthy battle. In the final chamber, the ghost of Svaknir will stand in the middle of a small pond, surrounded by draugr all seated on thrones. There are twenty-one on the ground floor, and an additional four on the ledge in the other end of the room. Everything seems quiet, until you get close to the ghost. He will then shout out: Svaknir and King Olaf One-Eye fighting Olaf! It is time! His words will make the entire room tremble and the first wave of draugr enemies will rise from their thrones. Eleven out of the twenty-one draugr on the ground floor will attack, ten of them will remain seated and unmoving. As a ghost, Svaknir is immortal and will pick up the fight, so you can do your best to help him out, or simply hide and wait for him to win. When all eleven enemies are slain, Svaknir will shout: Arise, Olaf! My vengeance is at hand! This will make the four draugr on the ledge rise and attack, so once again help Svaknir get his revenge. These draugr are all higher level than the first ones, but Svaknir will once again prove his skills and help you defeat them. When they are dead, he will finally shout out: ""Olaf!"" This will finally cause Olaf One-Eye himself to burst out of his coffin screaming: ""Insolent Bard. Die!"" He will then attack the both of you, so do your best to avoid his attacks and beware of his ability to disarm you. He can be a tough opponent, but will eventually fall to the ground and die. The tormented soul of Svaknir will finally be set free; he will head to the nearby door, pull out his lute and disappear in a ray of light. Loot Olaf's corpse for a leveled weapon and the key to his treasury, then examine the wall behind his coffin to learn a word of Whirlwind Sprint. Unlock the treasury door and examine the area for considerable loot, then pull the lever and make your way out of the barrow. A Bit of Improvising[edit] Back in the College, Viarmo will be overwhelmed with joy when you hand him the Verse, but will soon be disappointed. He complains about the quality of the rhymes themselves, and, even worse, that some of the writing is unreadable due to age. He will, however, accept a suggestion about making the missing parts up, simply to save the Festival. The next step will involve him reciting the poem and you making up the missing parts. Reading the book Olaf and the Dragon, found in the upstairs library, will give more background about the deceitful King. Although there is no correct version, how much the court likes what you make up will affect your reward. The persuade options in particular will be very well received at court. Once Viarmo is convinced that the Verse is worth reciting to the Jarl, he will leave the College and head towards the Blue Palace, inviting you along. Each choice gives you the listed number of points (the higher the number, the better the verse is received). The total of the two choices determines your reward. Choice #1 Olaf found him asleep. (2 points) Olaf made a deal with Numinex. (1 point) Olaf was Numinex. A dragon in human form! (Persuade) (3 points, requires Speech 25) Choice #2 (Note: There are multiple bugs with this choice.) Olaf ordered disguised troops to attack Solitude? (3 points) He convinced Solitude to attack Winterhold. (1 point) He sacked it and used magic to blame Solitude.

Ask him if he's ready and follow him up the stairs, then watch while he recites the embarrassing truth about the legendary King Olaf to the Court.  The verse: ""O, Olaf, our subjugator, the one-eyed betrayer"" O, Olaf, our subjugator, the one-eyed betrayer;  death-dealing demon and dragon-killing King. Your legend is lies, lurid and false; your cunning capture of Numinex, a con for the ages. No shouting match between dragon and man, no fire or fury did this battle entail. (Olaf found Numinex asleep): Olaf captured a fast-sleeping dragon, a mighty feat which the meek would not fail. (Olaf made a deal with Numinex): Olaf struck a deal to make himself king, Numinex let go though none tell that tale. (Olaf was Numinex. A dragon in human form!): Olaf was Numinex in human form, on moonless nights he would spread wings and sail. Olaf grabbed power, by promise and threat; From Falkreath to Winterhold, they fell to their knees; But Solitude stood strong, Skyrim's truest protectors. Olaf's vengeance was instant, inspired and wicked. The ""convinced Solitude to attack"" and ""sacked it in dragon form"" options are both bugged, causing the ""disguised troops"" line to be read instead. See the bugs section for more detail. (Olaf ordered disguised troops to attack Solitude): Olaf gave orders, Winterhold disguises. An attack on Solitude total destruction to follow. His men dressed up and then went out to fight, but they reversed Olaf's orders much to Winterhold's sorrow. (Olaf convinced Solitude to attack): Olaf sent word to Solitude's Jarl, cajoling and mocking and begging for a fight. From Winterhold Olaf had sent every message, upon attack he was nowhere in sight. (Olaf sacked Winterhold and used magic to blame Solitude): Because Solitude would not soon bend knee, Olaf would hurt them while his status accrued. He sacked Winterhold his only true ally, and used magic bold to blame Solitude. (Olaf sacked it in dragon form!): Because Solitude would not soon bend knee, Olaf would hurt them while his status accrued. He sacked Winterhold in dragonform, and bent their minds to blame Solitude. So ends the story of Olaf the liar, a thief and a scoundrel we of Solitude commit to the fire. In Solitude bards train for their service, they also gather each year and burn a King who deserves it. At the conclusion of the verse, Elisif will admit that Olaf was indeed a thief and a scoundrel and that the Festival is a celebration of Solitude and a condemnation of false Kings. She will reinstate the Festival and promise Viarmo a decent reward for the College. Viarmo will then turn to you and express his gratitude, even if he still will not promote you to Bard; you will have to wait until the Festival, when he will declare you a Bard in front of all College members. The Burning of a False King[edit] ""With the lighting of the effigy..."" Citizens cheering the burning King He then tells you to seek out Jorn and tell him to finish the preparations for the Festival. He will then leave Blue Palace and you are free to decide when to start the festival. Back in the College, Jorn will be excited about the news and will start right away, with a request to meet him after dark, and then the festival will be on. Wait around until 8pm then approach him again. He will then lead you around the College, to the courtyard where every member of the College is gathered, along with several residents and the resident Bards from the local inns. Talk to Bendt, Sorex Vinius, or Evette San for free snacks, then watch and listen as Viarmo sets the effigy on fire and declares you the newest addition to the Bards College. All guests will applaud and Viarmo himself will seek you out and explain that several College professors will have jobs for you and that the burning of the King will now be a weekly event. Finally, he will hand you your reward, a leveled amount of gold, and leave you alone with the burning King Olaf."

You will have to capture Falkreath for the Stormcloaks (if you joined the Stormcloaks) or complete the Battle for Windhelm (if you sided with the Imperials) before this quest becomes available. Once you have completed the prerequisite, speak with the jarl again and he will ask you to assist the people of the hold.

If they die after you assist them, they still count towards your Thane status. Also, you can befriend merchants if you have the Investor perk by investing in their stores. You must also purchase Hjerim, which costs 8,000 to 12,000 gold. Simply purchasing it is enough; there is no requirement to decorate, although it becomes more useful if decorated.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thane_of_the_Reach","Befriend the Jarl of the Reach. Assist five people of the Reach. Purchase Vlindrel Hall. Return to the jarl for your reward.","This is an umbrella quest for several other quests that must be completed if you wish to become Thane of the Reach. The Jarl requires you buy the house in town as well as performing five favors for the townsfolk. Once this is achieved you can become Thane. In order to receive this quest you must first aid the current Jarl. If the Jarl is Igmund, then you must usually kill a Forsworn leader and Find Hrolfdir's Shield; however, if he was ousted from Markarth during Season Unending and reinstated following The Battle for Fort Sungard, that is sufficient to begin this quest. If the Jarl is Thongvor, whether he was installed via Season Unending or The Battle for Fort Sungard, then the completion of that quest is sufficient to fulfill the prerequisite. Once you have completed the prerequisite, speak with the Jarl again and he will ask you to assist the people of the hold. You must assist five people in the hold, usually by completing favor quests for them. Note that many of the quest givers are non-essential NPCs, so their deaths would result in a loss of potential quests to complete. If they die after you assist them, they still count towards your Thane status. You can also befriend merchants if you have the Investor perk by investing in their stores. Note that there are several favor quests involving members of Orc strongholds in the Reach; assisting Orcs living in strongholds does not count towards your Thane quest, but Orcs in Markarth do count. You may consider completing The Heart of Dibella as successfully completing it befriends all four of the priestesses of Dibella, which is almost enough to qualify for thaneship alone. It also requires you to visit Karthwasten; resolving the Sanuarach mine dispute there (for either side) will be enough to complete this requirement. You must also purchase Vlindrel Hall, which costs 8,000 gold. Simply purchasing it is enough, there is no requirement to decorate, although it becomes more useful if decorated.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:That_Was_Always_There","Speak to Revyn Sadri to begin the quest and obtain Viola's Gold Ring. Choose whether to: Break into Viola Giordano's House and return the ring, or Tell Viola Giordano about the ring.","The Accidental Fence[edit] Revyn Sadri runs a pawnshop, Sadri's Used Wares, in Windhelm's Gray Quarter. Revyn tends to tell visitors to his store, somewhat overemphatically, that, ""All my goods are legitimate, which is more than I can say for some"". If you question him on it, he will change his story and confess that he bought a ring before realizing that it matched the description of an item recently stolen from Viola Giordano. Even if you offer to return the ring for Revyn, he is still worried. He insists that Viola can't be told, because she would surely report the crime to the Jarl. Instead, he wants you to sneak into Viola Giordano's House and leave the ring. Your quest log at this point suggests that you only have one option for how to proceed, namely to return the ring. However, Revyn's dialogue hints at a second option: you can tell Viola about the stolen ring. Option 1: Return the Ring[edit] To return the ring, the first step is gaining entrance to Viola's house. Her house is a large manor located in the Valunstrad district, on the west side of town. The front door is locked with a difficult leveled lock (Expert or Master level). Alternatively, you can opt to pickpocket the key from Viola. Once you enter the house, the dresser where you are expected to place the ring is located immediately to the right of the front door. Open the dresser, and select that you want to ""Store"" the ring in the dresser. This will trigger a quest update. Return to Revyn to obtain your reward, a medium leveled amount of gold. In addition, Revyn's disposition towards you will increase. The most immediate implication is that you will be able to freely take all low-cost items in the store and sleep in his bed for free. You will also be able to buy training in Speech to level 50. He is the only Speech trainer that you can trade with (which you can do to get the gold back) without joining the Volkihar vampiresDG. Option 2: Tell Viola[edit] The other option requires you to find Viola. She is frequently found walking the streets of Windhelm, or else at Candlehearth Hall in the evenings. If you talk to her, you will have the option to tell Viola about the ring. She takes the ring but seems more interested in finding ways to punish Revyn than actually being happy to have the ring back. In particular, she promises to report this to the Jarl and get Revyn's taxes doubled or even tripled. She will also reward you with a medium leveled amount of gold. Her disposition towards you will increase, one implication being that you can freely take all low-cost items in her house. This is also the only way to be able to marry her. On the other hand, Revyn's disposition will decrease. This will result in negative comments every time you enter his store, but he will still trade with you (and his other dialogue will be as friendly as otherwise). Reward[edit] Levels Reward   1–9 400   10–19 600   20–29 800   30–39 1,000   40+ 1,200"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thieves_Guild_Caravan_Fence_Quest","Speak to Tonilia. Deliver moon sugar to Ri'saad. Return to Tonilia.","A Word with Tonilia[edit] Once you have completed three reputation quests for the Thieves Guild, speak with Tonilia in the Ragged Flagon. Before you get a chance to say anything, she will ask you to do a favor for her. The Guild needs a reliable way to transport goods across Skyrim, and Tonilia believes the Khajiit caravans can be an asset in this regard - if they are willing, that is. She requests that you speak to the leader of the caravans, a Khajiit peddler named Ri'saad about securing an alliance between the caravans and the Guild. In addition, you are to deliver a satchel of moon sugar to Ri'saad as a gift. Finding the Caravan[edit] To find Ri'saad, use the map to fast travel close to his caravan. The caravan travels between Whiterun and Markarth, and stays outside each city for approximately two days before setting out again. Unless the caravan is camped for the night, it will move around. So, expect the target to move while you fast travel, and think about which direction it is traveling in and jump ahead. A ""Sweet"" Deal[edit] After you have located the caravan, speak to Ri'saad, and tell him that you bring an offer from the Thieves Guild. This will cause the Khajiit to become thoughtful. To continue, hand him the moon sugar, which he will gratefully accept, saying that he looks forward to the partnership. Ri'saad will also comment that he and his fellow caravans will buy any stolen goods brought to them. Return to Tonilia[edit] To finish the quest, return to Tonilia. She will thank you for your help and reward you with a leveled amount of gold, as detailed below. In addition, the Khajiit Atahbah, Ma'jhad, and Zaynabi will now fence stolen goods for you.

Talk to Paarthurnax.","Dragonrend[edit] Learning the Clear Skies shout With the information about Alduin's defeat learned at Sky Haven Temple, travel to High Hrothgar to meet with the Greybeards. When you arrive, you will first need to turn over the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller and learn the final Word for Unrelenting Force if you have not yet done so. Once you have, tell Arngeir that you need to learn the shout used to defeat Alduin. He will be quite shocked and ask where you learned about such a shout. While the Greybeards and the Blades do not have a history of cooperation, if you refuse to tell Arngeir where you came across the information, he will not help you. You can either tell him that you learned it from Alduin's Wall or that you were talking to the Blades. In either case, he will be strongly offended and will be reluctant to help. Depending on your response, Einarth may chastise Arngeir for his impertinence by saying, ""Arngeir. Rek/Rok los Dovahkiin, Strundu'ul. Rek/Rok fen tinvaak Paarthurnax."" meaning, ""Arngeir. She/He is Dovahkiin, Stormcrown. She/He will speak (with) Paarthurnax"". Regardless, Arngeir eventually offers a hasty apology, saying the decision to help or not help you is not ultimately his. He tells you that the shout used to end Alduin's reign of terror is called Dragonrend. However, Arngeir cannot teach it to you because he does not know it and the origins have been lost. If asked, Arngeir will explain that the shout was created during the terrifying reign of the dragons and is a shout of pure evil, embodying all the cruelty, fear, and horror of the time. If you want to learn this shout, you must speak with Paarthurnax, the leader of their order. Further questioning reveals that Paarthurnax lives in seclusion at the peak of the Throat of the World and surpasses all of the Greybeards in the Way of the Voice. Arngeir will offer to help you reach Paarthurnax and leads you out into the courtyard where you will be taught all three words of the shout Clear Skies. You are now ready to attempt the trek up to the summit of the Throat of the World. The path up is blocked by magical winds dealing severe frost damage, even with resist frost effects. Use the shout Arngeir gave you to clear away the damaging mists. Paarthurnax[edit] When you reach the summit, a dragon approaches. However, resist the urge to attack, as the dragon will land and address you: ""Drem Yol Lok. Greetings, wunduniik. I am Paarthurnax. Who are you? What brings you to my strunmah ... my mountain?"" After you explain your objective, Paarthurnax will respond: ""Drem. Patience. There are formalities that must be observed, at the first meeting of two of the dov. By long tradition, the elder speaks first. Hear my Thu'um! Feel it in your bones. Match it, if you are Dovahkiin!"" He will then shoot a bout of flame onto a wall and encourage you to participate in ""tinvaak"" (loosely translated, ""conversation""). Inspect the word he left behind to learn a new Shout, and Paarthurnax will grant you his knowledge of it, saying ""A gift, Dovahkiin. Yol. Understand Fire as the dov do. Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as mortal, but as dovah!"" Use this new shout on Paarthurnax. He will agree with the opinions voiced by Greybeards that ""the dragonblood runs strong in you"", even if you are a ""joor"" (mortal), and offer to answer your questions. After the formalities, ask Paarthurnax about Dragonrend. He will admit that he was expecting this, as ""Alduin and Dovahkiin return together"". Though he doesn't know the shout, he believes it could be learned by returning to the beginning of the ""Tiid-Ahraan"", the Time-Wound on the Throat of the World. An Elder Scroll, or ""Kel"" would be necessary to activate the portal and allow you to view the first Tongues using the Thu'um to defeat Alduin. As the quest ends, the dragon admits he has no idea where to find an Elder Scroll. Your quest log suggests you talk to Arngeir or Esbern for more information."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Through_a_Glass,_Darkly","Travel to the specified geyser pool in Eastmarch. Attempt to take Shadowrend and defeat your summoned Shadow. Take either the greatsword or the battleaxe version of Shadowrend.","Inner Darkness[edit] The Shadow Once you've installed the Shadowrend Creation, you will receive this quest. The journal entry will inform you that an inner voice is drawing you to a geyser pool in Eastmarch in order to confront the darkness within yourself. The geyser can be found near the Atronach Stone, to the northeast of it. Stand with the Atronach Stone at your back and walk toward a trio of pine trees in the water. Continue past the leftmost tree. The pool contains skeletal remains which have stained the water black, and will only begin to froth when you approach. Above this anomaly, a weapon will appear. It is Shadowrend, a shadow weapon from the ruins of Milchar in the Shivering Isles. Shadowrend is both a greatsword and a battleaxe, and it will proceed to cycle between each version, with the weapon warping in and out of existence until you attempt to take it. Touching the weapon will summon a Shadow enemy named ""[player]'s Shadow"". It is a shadowy clone of you, meaning it will wear your equipment and know all of your spells, powers, and shouts. Defeat the Shadow and claim Shadowrend from its remains to complete the quest. Whichever version of the weapon you didn't select will reappear above the pool, where it will hang in the air indefinitely. You can return to the pool any time in order to switch between the two versions of Shadowrend. You must have it in your inventory for the swap to function, otherwise it will say, ""You lack the required item."" Each version is a powerful Daedric weapon in its own right, with a 15% weakness to magic enchantment."

Claim the set of studded Dragonscale armor.","In order to start the quest, you need to read The Crimson Dirks, v4 in Candlehearth Hall. It recalls a tale where a young Bosmer named Fathrys had hoped to wed Zaharia. She dismissively rejected him by saying that she would only accept him if he were to give her a dragon scale. Hearing this, the drunken bandit mage Antonius regaled an old Nord legend where the warrior Ulfnir Bone-Skin slew the dragon Vithrelnaak, fashioning armor from his scales and ultimately burying it with him. Antonius claims that Ulfnir's corpse protects this armor through death in the barrow near Yorgrim Overlook. With this, the quest directs you to Yorgrim Overlook to investigate. When you reach the overlook, you will find the lifeless skeleton of Fathrys holding his Poem for Zaharia. You will be attacked by two generic skeletons and the skeleton of Ulfnir Bone-Skin himself. Defeat them and loot the Overlook Key. With it, you can unlock the gate.

Escape when the Emperor dies. Return to the Sanctuary.","This Soup Is To Die For[edit] The Emperor's decoy tasting his last meal After securing the writ of passage into the Emperor's service, the rest of the plan is ready to fall into place. Following Astrid's instructions, travel to Solitude with the poisonous herb she gave you and report to head of security, Commander Maro. Show him the writ you stole from the Gourmet to gain entrance to the castle. Maro will allow you to pass with no trouble (commenting on your clothing depending on whether or not you are wearing the chef's hat or clothes), telling you to report to the castle's chef, Gianna. When Gianna greets you, she is both nervous and excited at the prospect of working with the great Gourmet. If you have yet to don your chef's hat, she will direct you to one on the shelf; you cannot begin ""cooking"" until you are appropriately attired. Once you are ready, say, Enough! The Gourmet is here to cook, not talk! Let us begin. Gianna flusters, ""Oh! Yes, but of course. Ahem. The Emperor has requested your signature dish - the Potage le Magnifique. I've taken the liberty of getting it started. But the cookbook only says so much, and everyone makes the Potage differently. I would be honored if we could make it... the Gourmet's special way. The base broth is already boiled. We can get started right now. So... which ingredient should I add next?"" The Potage le Magnifique, as described in Uncommon Taste, consists of a basic recipe and more ingredients added based on the chef's inspiration. Thus, you now have four ingredients to select, at each stage there are three options: the normal, the strange, and her choice. Option Dialogue option Responses   First ingredient   Normal Carrots. ""Carrots? Really? Okay... What next?""   Strange A sweetroll. ""Ooohh.... how decadent. I never would have guessed it. What next?""   Her choice Remain silent. ""Oh, I get it. This is a test, right? You want to see how well I know the Potage le Magnifique. Well then, I think a pinch of frost salts should do the trick, right? Now what?""   Second ingredient   Normal You must now add a splash of mead. ""Ah, of course. I suspected as much.""   Strange The next ingredient is... vampire dust. ""Vampire dust? Seriously? Hmm... yes. I guess I can see how that would add a more... earthy texture. And, oddly enough, we do have some on hand... All right. What next, then?""   Her choice Remain silent. ""My choice, then? Very well. I think we should add some Chaurus eggs. For additional flavor.""   Third ingredient   Normal One nirnroot. ""Really? Oh, I use Nirnroot as a special seasoning all the time as well. What a wonderful idea. Okay. Now what?""   Strange We shall now add... a giant's toe! ""A... giant's toe? You're... sure about that?"", I said a giant's toe! Do not question the Gourmet!, ""Of course! I.... I'm sorry. One giant's toe. There. What, um... What next?""   Her choice Remain silent. ""Ooookay.... Um.... Let me see. Thistle? Yes, let's try that. Just a sprig or two...""   Fourth ingredient   Normal Diced horker meat. ""Hmmm... horker. So delicious. I swear, is there a soul alive who doesn't enjoy the taste of... Sorry, I didn't mean to get carried away. There we go, one cup of diced horker meat. I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?""   Strange You must add... a septim. ""A Septim? As in... a gold coin? Really? Ah, I see now. That would give the Potage le Magnifique a slightly metallic - but delicious - aftertaste. Simply brilliant. I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?""   Her choice Remain silent. ""My choice, hmm? All right, then - tomatoes. Simple, yet infinitely flavorful. Don't you agree? Well, I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?"" When you are finished don't forget to add your ""special"" final ingredient:  ""Oh? What is this, some kind of herb? Are you sure? The Potage tastes perfect as it is. Any other ingredient might..."" Now, now, Gianna. Who's the Gourmet here? ""Heh, I'm sorry. Of course. It's your most famous recipe, after all. All right then, your secret ingredient's been added. And if I may say so... it has been an honor, getting a chance to prepare a meal with, well... the best chef in the entire Empire. I'll carry the stew pot, and lead the way up to the dining room. I'm sure the Emperor and his guests are dying to meet you."" It is not necessary to poison the Emperor with the Jarrin Root, however, in order to successfully complete the quest—you may kill him any way you want. The Last Supper[edit] When the Potage is complete, follow Gianna into the dining room as she serves the food to the Emperor. Right before you go in, there is a copy of the Enchanting skill book Catalogue of Weapon Enchantments on the table to your left. The Emperor will be speaking to the diners and a noblewoman about his cousin's murder when you enter, while two Penitus Oculatus agents stand guard behind him. Gianna will serve the Emperor the meal you cooked and, regardless of the ingredients, he will compliment its amazing taste. If you added the Jarrin Root, the Emperor will soon die a rather unspectacular death. If you didn't add the poison, the Emperor and his guests will continue to slurp their soup until you assassinate him, which is easy enough since he has only 1 health point. The guards will attack you upon the Emperor's death, and Gianna will attempt to defend you before fleeing, although this may be avoided by successfully sneaking as he dies. Once the Emperor is dead, exit through the door opposite where you entered upstairs. Betrayal[edit] Once out the door it looks like you are home free. However, as you cross the bridge, you will be ambushed by Commander Maro and several of his agents. He reveals that the man you killed was a decoy. Maro explains that someone from the Dark Brotherhood betrayed you and revealed to Maro your plans to assassinate the Emperor. Maro agreed to allow the Brotherhood to continue its business in exchange for you. He then tells you that because the Dark Brotherhood killed his son he intends to go back on his word and wipe them out. He has sent his agents to attack the sanctuary already. As soon as the conversation with Maro begins, your bounty in Haafingar will be set to 1500, so the city guards will be on the lookout for you. Escape the city by following the tower's stairs to the very bottom and head to the Brotherhood Sanctuary. You cannot fast travel directly to the sanctuary, so the quickest option is to fast travel to Falkreath and head west. The quest ends when you reach the Sanctuary."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Touching_the_Sky","Locate Auriel's Bow. Speak to Gelebor. Fill the Initiate's Ewer. Kill Vyrthur. Retrieve Auriel's Bow.","Last of the Snow Elves[edit] Serana gazing out over the Forgotten Vale After learning the location of Auriel's Bow, travel to Darkfall Cave in the far northwestern reaches of Skyrim, just south-southwest of the Orc stronghold Mor Khazgur. The cave is very dark, so you may wish to light your way using torches, the Vampire's Sight ability, or light spells. Follow the path, past a frostbite spider until you come to a bridge and what seems like a dead end. Once you try to cross back over the bridge, you will be forced, by either a rock trap or the bridge collapsing, into a very fast moving underground river that sends you downstream. Try to keep your head above the water, unless you have a waterbreathing ability. Eventually, you'll be thrown out of the current, and immediately attacked by a few frostbite spiders. Continue along the cavernous path, until you reach a small camp with a dead Breton; a note on her body sheds light on what happened: trolls. From here you can either head down the path beyond the dead Breton, where after negotiating a falling boulders trap you will arrive in a chamber with two frost trolls. At the far western side is a stone shrine and Knight-Paladin Gelebor, one of the last two Snow Elves. Alternatively, you arrive immediately behind Gelebor by pulling the chain hidden behind the dead Breton's lean-to and taking the passage it reveals. Speak to Gelebor, and he will offer you a deal: slay his brother, Vyrthur, who was corrupted by Falmer, and Gelebor will help you in obtaining Auriel's Bow. Vyrthur is hiding in the Inner Sanctum of the Forgotten Vale, a gigantic outdoor elven ruin with Ayleid-like architecture. In order to make your way there you must fill a jug, the Initiate's Ewer, with water from five wayshrines: the Wayshrines of Illumination, Learning, Radiance, Resolution, and Sight. Seeking Illumination[edit] The first wayshrine, the Wayshrine of Illumination, is in Darkfall Passage, which can be accessed through the portal Gelebor opens. The Portal appears in the back of the shrine-like building that Gelebor raises from the ground. It may be invisible, with no Quest Marker pointing to it, but walking to the back of the shrine wall you will be able to activate the Portal none the less (see the Bugs section for more info). The passage is just as dark as the cave, but is illuminated by tube worms, which look like odd pink flowers that retract into their tubes when you come near, whose faint pink light help to guide the way. Along the winding underground trek you will encounter several leveled falmer and chaurus; be sure to destroy any chaurus cocoons you come across before they have a chance to hatch. The shrine itself is in the final chamber of the passage, a radically different environment to the rest of the zone where vale deer and vale sabre cats inhabit a small forest. The Shrine is tended to by Prelate Sidanyis, who will activate it for you. Fill your ewer from the font and head through the portal to the Forgotten Vale. Resolving to Learn and See[edit] The Wayshrine of Resolution The second wayshrine, the Wayshrine of Sight, can be found soon after emerging from Darkfall Passage into the Forgotten Vale and is tended to by Prelate Athring. It is to the north of the path that climbs up out of the entry vale through a set of stone arches, and west-northwest of the Forgotten Vale Cave. To find it, stop at the highest stone arch just before entering a narrow pass and head north along the cliff side, past a small frozen pond and several fallen trees, until you reach a silver ore vein. Just beyond is the Wayshrine, shrouded amidst a dense layer of fog. The third shrine, the Wayshrine of Learning, is tended to by Prelate Celegriath. To reach it, head back to the stone arches and instead press on west, negotiating a narrow pass inhabited by frostbite spiders. Make your way down to the narrow river valley to a skeleton and the Unknown Book, Vol. I; reading it will start the Forgotten Vale Books Quest. Head downstream for a little while to reach the wayshrine. To reach the fourth shrine, the Wayshrine of Resolution, cross the river and make your way up the turnpike path until you reach a large, frozen lake. Beware of the two dragons, Naaslaarum and Voslaarum, who will attack you while you cross the lake (provided you have completed Dragon Rising). The wayshrine, tended to by Prelate Nirilor, is above the northwest bank of the lake. Don't forget to pick up the Drain Vitality dragon shout from the large rock jutting out from the middle of the frozen lake south of this wayshrine. The Long Walk to Radiance[edit] The fifth and final wayshrine, the Wayshrine of Radiance, is north of the Wayshrine of Resolution and is reached after a long, arduous trek through the Forgotten Vale and Glacial Crevice. To reach the latter, you can press on north and negotiate a long series of Falmer encampments and bridges suspended across the cliff-faces, or alternatively head southwest from the wayshrine across the mountainside and overlooking the lake. After a short while you arrive in a hanging valley with some moonstone ore veins; from here you can head down to the entrance of the Crevice. If you're looking for Unknown Book, Vol. III for the Forgotten Vale Books Quest, you can find it in a Falmer hut a couple of bridges before reaching the Crevice entrance. The Crevice itself consists of a series of glacial chambers with icy ledges and rope bridges that ascend among a scattering of Falmer tents. Dispose of the many leveled Falmer and the odd frost troll that occupy this zone until you once again emerge out into the Forgotten Vale. This final part of the Vale consists of a confusing maze of Falmer tents and platforms crowded within a series of narrow, twisting canyons. Pick up Unknown Book, Vol. IV from a hut in the second village just before the entrance to the tunnel which takes you to the Wayshrine of Radiance, tended to by Prelate Edhelbor. Vyrthur destroying Auriel's Chapel Breaching the Sanctum[edit] Down the path from the Wayshrine of Radiance and across a stone bridge lies the Inner Sanctum. Pour water from your Ewer into the stone basin, and the door in front of you will be bathed in green light before opening. Inside you will find a number of chambers with frozen Falmer and chaurus. Many of the Falmer hold items that can be looted, which may cause one or more of them to break out of their icy state and attack you. There is a chest tucked away in a partially hidden corner, some loose items lying about, and a number of lootable skeletons that Serana will raise during combat. Head north through the chambers, placing the Ewer on any pedestals to open the gates nearby, until you reach an icy tunnel leading to Auriel's Chapel. This tunnel branches to the left and doubles back leading to another chest and some more loose items. Once you enter Auriel's Chapel, jump down from the stone ledge where you emerge and you will arrive in a stone chamber full of frozen Falmer and chaurus. From this point, you will not be able to retreat but can only continue forward. Vyrthur sits on a throne at the far end of the room, behind an impenetrable claw-like barrier. Once you come near, he will come to life and commence a fierce battle: the frozen Falmer and chaurus will start unfreezing in groups, while Vyrthur periodically summons a Frost Atronach, collapses parts of the ceiling and then hurls the broken boulders at you. Once all enemies are defeated, in a mixture of rage and panic, Vyrthur will collapse the rest of the roof on you through a huge magical explosion, commencing a cutscene during which the only action you can undertake is walking or running. You awake to Serana telling you to get up and get on the balcony. Follow her until you reach Vyrthur, who will explain that after having been forsaken to vampirism by Auri-El, he created the prophecy that Lord Harkon is chasing. By dousing Auriel's Bow with the blood of a Daughter of Coldharbour—Serana— Vyrthur would exact his revenge by corrupting Auri-El's influence on Nirn. Understandably displeased, Serana will lift him by the throat but will be thrown back as Vyrthur uses magic to free himself from her grip and attacks you. Once he has been defeated, a wayshrine will appear and Gelebor will walk through it. He will be surprised that the real reason for Vyrthur's actions was vampirism rather than corruption by the Falmer and thank you by proclaiming you worthy to carry Auriel's Bow. He will also bless some Sunhallowed arrows for you if you ask, and remain there if you wish to come back for more at any time. Retrieve Auriel's Bow from the newly-appeared wayshrine to complete the quest."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Toying_With_The_Dead","Travel to Yngvild. Collect the four journals. Return to Vekel.","The Proposition[edit] If you approach Vekel in The Ragged Flagon and ask him for work, he will tell you about some journals that he's been after: ""I have a buyer with a very odd taste in literature, looking for some particular books. I'm told they're the ravings of a madman, a wizard named Arondil and his peculiar cravings. It's said to be in four volumes and very hard to come by. My client is offering quite a reward for them, which I'd split with you."" If you ask for him to elaborate further on the journals, he will go on to say, ""Recently, a woman was found... naked and shivering along the road to Dawnstar. The only information the guard could get from her were tales of strange experiments and Arondil scribbling in his journals."" Asking about Arondil won't get you much, as Vekel says, ""Only rumors. He used to have a home in Dawnstar until they burned it down. The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform. After he made for Yngvild, he was never heard from again."" Once you agree to retrieve the journals, he will conclude the conversation with: ""Then we have a deal. In his later years, Andoril [sic] moved into some ice caves known as Yngvild. He prefered [sic] the solitude in which to perform his, um... experiments."" Yngvild[edit] The ruins of Yngvild Yngvild is an ice cave located on an island northeast of Dawnstar. To access it, find the entrance on the north side by following the pathway up the island. Once inside, you are able to find the first three journals. The first journal is located on a table near two Yngvild ghosts and a leveled draugr. The second journal can be found on a table alongside a woodcutter's axe and a scroll. The third journal can be found on a table just before the door leading to Yngvild Throne Room. Yngvild Throne Room[edit] Once you enter the main chamber in the throne room, you will see Arondil sitting on his throne with an Yngvild ghost alongside him. The fourth and final part of the journal lies through the door behind him, on a table along with an unusual gem for the quest No Stone Unturned. Once you have retrieved the journals, you can exit the cave and head back to The Ragged Flagon to receive your reward. Reward[edit] Return all four journals to Vekel and he will remark, ""Good. I was hoping you hadn't forgotten about it. As promised, here's your payment for bringing them to me. Got it as part of a fair trade from my client."" Your reward for returning the journals is a leveled and enchanted one-handed weapon."

Brynjolf will explain the significance of your findings; Mercer plans one more heist before disappearing for good. The only hope of catching him is to intercept him at the location. Brynjolf informs you that Karliah has requested to speak with both of you. A Secret Order[edit] When you speak to Karliah, she reveals to you and Brynjolf that Mercer Frey was a Nightingale, an agent of Nocturnal.  Because of this, Karliah is concerned about being at full strength and on equal footing before pursuing Mercer. She asks you and Brynjolf to meet her at The Shadow Stone outside of Riften. The Nightingale Edge[edit] Here you will find yourself at the entrance to Nightingale Hall wherein is the edge over Mercer that Karliah was alluding to. Proceed inside, but don't get too far ahead as Karliah begins telling you more about the Nightingales and their role. She will later remark that this was the Nightingales' base, and that she will return here once done with Mercer. After crossing a bridge, you can find a copy of the Pickpocket skill book Purloined Shadows to the right. Your first stop is the armor chamber. Activate the stone Karliah indicates and the Nightingale Armor is placed in your inventory. You must equip it in order to continue. Once you have donned the armor, Karliah will discuss the next step: your sworn oath to Nocturnal. Follow Karliah further into the cave past side passages leading to sleeping quarters where you can find a copy of the Sneak skill book The Red Kitchen Reader and living spaces. Trinity Restored[edit] The first step towards your induction. Once you have agreed to Nocturnal's conditions on becoming a Nightingale, Karliah will operate the pull chain for the gate leading into oath taking chamber. You will be directed to stand on a specific platform. If you have a follower with you, their presence does not affect the outcome in any way. Karliah summons Nocturnal and asks to resume her role as a Nightingale as well as induct you and Brynjolf into their ranks. Nocturnal agrees. Now that you are officially inducted into the Nightingales, Karliah will explain that Mercer got into the vault by using the Skeleton Key which he stole from the Twilight Sepulcher; a grievous insult to Nocturnal which threatens the very foundations of the Nightingales. The key needs to be returned to the Sepulcher to set things right and return the uncanny luck of the Thieves Guild. This is a big day for you as now Brynjolf has something to add. With Mercer disgraced, the issue of the leadership of the Thieves Guild is at hand. Brynjolf states that he and Karliah think you would be the right person for the job, once you've proven yourself by dealing with Mercer and completing all of the Thieves Guild additional jobs.

Loot containers and bodies for weapons, armor, and basic equipment. Escape from Helgen.","Awakening[edit] ""Hey, you. You're finally awake."" Fellow prisoners, Lokir and Ulfric Stormcloak You begin the game to find yourself bound at the wrists and under Imperial guard custody in a prisoner caravan. In the carriage with you is Ralof (a Stormcloak soldier), Lokir (a horse thief), and Ulfric Stormcloak (leader of the Stormcloak rebellion and Jarl of Windhelm). Ralof sits across from you, with Lokir next to him and Ulfric to your right. As revealed by Ralof, you are all prisoners of the Empire, who had set an ambush for the Stormcloaks near Darkwater Crossing. You and Lokir were caught up in the same action, though at the time you had been crossing the border, and Lokir had stolen a horse. Despite this, you and Lokir were arrested as potential Stormcloak sympathizers and are now being sent to Helgen for execution. The carriage soon reaches Helgen, a town in Falkreath Hold not far from the southern border of Skyrim. At the time of your arrival, Falkreath's Jarl is loyal to the Empire, and the hold is controlled by the Imperial Legion, though the Stormcloaks have some presence in the area, hiding in a camp within the Hold. As you enter Helgen, Ralof will make a comment about General Tullius, who is on horseback by an Imperial captain, facing First Emissary Elenwen and a few other Thalmor members. The carriage will ride through the village and draw to a stop in the central area of the town. The Imperial captain orders you and the other prisoners off the carts, then instructs you to proceed to the execution block as your name is called. Hadvar, an Imperial soldier, will first call Ulfric Stormcloak, and then Ralof. When Lokir is called, he will attempt to flee, but will always fail, since the Imperial captain will have him shot by an archer. After this, Hadvar will then demand you to step forward. Who Are You?[edit] ""Who are you?"" When Hadvar asks for your identity, you'll need to take a moment to decide. Game: (Create and name your character.) Once you've created and named your character, Hadvar will make a comment based on your race. Possible Comments   Race Dialogue   Altmer You're not with the Thalmor Embassy, are you high elf? No, that can't be right...   I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Summerset Isle.   Argonian Are you a relative of one of the Riften dock workers, Argonian?   I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Black Marsh.   Bosmer Not many wood elves would choose to come alone to Skyrim.   I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Valenwood.   Breton You from Daggerfall, Breton? Fleeing from some court intrigue?   I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to High Rock.   Dunmer Another refugee? Gods really have abandoned your people, dark elf.   I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Morrowind.   Imperial You're a long way from the Imperial City. What're you doing in Skyrim?   I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Cyrodiil.   Khajiit You with one of the trade caravans, Khajiit? Your kind always seems to find trouble.   I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Elsweyr.   Nord You picked a bad time to come home to Skyrim, kinsman.   I'm sorry. At least you'll die here, in your homeland.   Orc You from one of the strongholds, Orc? How did you end up here?   I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Orsinium.   Redguard What're you doing here, Redguard? You a sellsword? A sailor from Stros M'kai?   I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Hammerfell.  Keep Your Head[edit] The captain will order your death even though your name is not on the list. You will be forced to follow her to the executioner's block and after a brief confrontation between General Tullius and Ulfric Stormcloak a distant noise will echo across the sky. ""What was that?"" The general will dismiss it as nothing and order that the executions begin, and a priestess of Arkay will begin to administer the last rites to the condemned. A Stormcloak soldier will interrupt her and is promptly executed, and the captain will then order you to step up to the block. An ominous sound will again echo through the mountains, this time louder. Most of the assembly will be briefly distracted, but the captain will not be put off by this. You will be ordered to the block and forced into position, ready to be executed. From that perspective, you should have a view of the headsman and the tower behind him. As the headsman raises his axe, a dragon known as Alduin flies into the scene.  Return of the World-Eater[edit] The dragon will descend onto the nearby tower with a crash and proceed to use a special shout that turns the sky red and sends flaming meteors crashing down, which eventually damages the city beyond repair, knocking the headsman to the ground. Alduin begins his attack on Helgen. The second shout he uses, Unrelenting Force, will stagger you. However, Ralof will urge you to your feet to escape, reasoning that the gods may not provide another chance. When you are able to stand, you'll be able to move about freely, and the quest will appear in your journal. Make Your Way to the Keep[edit] ""In here! This way! Come on!"" If you are able to get your bearings soon enough, you can follow right behind Ralof. If it takes you a little time, Ralof will go into a tall tower to the south-southwest and call to you: ""In here. This way! Come on!"" Follow him into the tower as fireballs rain down from the sky and boulders fly off in all directions from the explosions. Despite the apparent danger, you will have no trouble getting into the tower unless you loiter in unsheltered areas for an extended time. Enter the building far enough so that the door can close behind you. Inside, you'll see some injured Stormcloaks and another tending to them. Stepping onto the carpet in the middle of the small room and turning back around toward the door will position you to observe a conversation between Ralof and Ulfric. At this point you cannot pick-up or interact with items with your hands, as they are bound. No one cuts your bonds. Alduin's shout blasts through the stairway. Alduin attacks. Both Ralof and Ulfric will urge you to hurry up through the tower. Follow Ralof up the staircase. When a Stormcloak soldier up ahead tells you that some fallen masonry needs to be moved out of the way, the wall to your right (southeast) will be blown in by Alduin. He will then attack through the hole with a Fire Breath shout. Though you cannot perceive it as such, Alduin will shout ""Toor... Shul!"" meaning ""Inferno... Sun"" in the dragon language. This shout will knock Ralof off the stairs, but he will climb back up to you. The gods may indeed be providing you some extra protection, at least for now—you will not be hurt by the shout, even if you don't heed Ralof's warning to step back. Eventually, however, once you venture outside of Helgen, encounters with dragons will prove much more dangerous. After Alduin flies off, Ralof will urge you to jump out the hole just created and down into a partially destroyed inn below, telling you that they will follow as soon as they can and meet you on the other side. Your target landing spot will be indicated by your objective marker. Move to the ledge and jump while continuing to move forward. On landing, you may hear yourself grunt in pain, but you will only take minor damage. Travel eastward through the inn and drop down through the hole in the floor. Your objective marker will indicate the next waypoint. Follow Hadvar, the Imperial soldier you just saw near the execution block. He will be outside the door from the inn, and to your left (northeast), trying to help some citizens. Hadvar will be trying to coax a young boy, Haming, away from an open area where his father, Torolf, lies injured in the road. As the boy returns toward Hadvar, Alduin will land to the northeast and send a Fire Breath shout toward Hadvar and the boy, killing Torolf. Hadvar will take Haming to safety back near the inn with another man, Gunnar Stone-Eye, and leave the boy in his care. When he sees you, Hadvar will address you as ""prisoner"" and tell you to follow him if you want to stay alive. Ralof: ""Jump and keep going! We'll meet you later!"" Follow Hadvar as he proceeds northeasterly across the area where Alduin just killed Torolf. Hadvar's purpose at this point is to ""Find General Tullius and join the defense"" of Helgen. Passing between a building and a stone wall, Hadvar will stop and advise you to stay near the wall. Alduin will then land on top of the wall and direct a Fire Breath shout at a Legionnaire ahead of you and to the right, around the corner. Once Alduin takes flight again, follow Hadvar up the steps and then to the left (northward) through the gap in the wall. Inside the ruined building, jog to the left, then turn right (eastward). You will exit into an open area where a number of Imperial mages, soldiers, and General Tullius will be counter-attacking Alduin with arrows and fireballs. Follow Hadvar to the northeast.    Turn to the left (northward).    Hadvar: ""Stay close to the [left] wall.""    Alduin lands and attacks again. Follow Hadvar up the steps...    ...then to the left (north).    Jog around to the left, then turn right (eastward).    Soldiers and mages counter-attack the dragon.  When Hadvar approaches General Tullius, the general will order him into the Keep, announcing a retreat. Telling you to stay close to him, Hadvar will head north, then turn left towards the entrance to the Keep. Note: Hadvar should be taken seriously when he tells you to stay close to him. If you tag fairly close behind him at this point, Alduin will not harm you. If you choose to lag behind or explore the area, however, you will do so at your own considerable risk. Eventually, Alduin's shouts may hit you between this point and entering the Keep. He can use the Fire Breath shout and the less serious Unrelenting Force shout. If you are hit with the former, it may or may not kill you. The latter will violently shove you or may send you flying for a short distance. Once you reach the exterior of the Keep, if you remain outside for an extended period, Alduin may land and attack with a shout at close quarters or physically with his jaws, an attack that will be fatal. After running under an archway, Hadvar will encounter Ralof just outside the Keep. The two enemies will draw their weapons and prepare to fight before realizing that getting into the Keep and away from the dragon is a higher priority. As Hadvar and Ralof rush to two different but nearby entrances to the Keep, both calling to you to follow them, your journal will update to show the objective of making your way to the Keep as completed, and the next objective will appear, presenting you with a choice. Unsafe Haven[edit] Note: After entering the Keep, depending on whether you chose to enter with Hadvar or Ralof, the part of the interior map which you emerge in and the initial events that occur will differ slightly. If you choose to go with Ralof, you will discover the body of a dead Stormcloak, Gunjar, in a circular room immediately after entering the keep. After freeing you from your bindings, Ralof will instruct you to recover the gear on Gunjar's body for your own use. While you equip yourself, Ralof will examine the doors. He will discover one door is locked, and the other can't be opened from the side you're on. Luckily, the captain and an Imperial soldier will come through and open the door secured from the other side. Once they open the door, you will be forced to kill them to recover the key to the other gate from their bodies. Don't forget to loot the barracks they came from.    If you choose to go with Hadvar, you will enter the keep to find yourself in the barracks room where Hadvar will cut your bonds and instruct you to loot the room for some equipment. Once you have acquired some gear from the marked chest, he will open a gate and you will follow him down a path to the circular room containing Gunjar's body. Here you will face two hostile Stormcloaks. Once they are defeated, follow Hadvar onward through the opposite door. From here onward, the physical path taken by both Hadvar and Ralof is identical. Only the type of enemies and the accompanying dialogue is different: for Hadvar's path you face Stormcloaks, while for Ralof's path you face Imperial soldiers. Going through the door onto the now opened-up path, the dragon's activities above will cause the ceiling to fall, forcing you to divert through a door on your left, where you will discover a storeroom with two Imperial soldiers/Stormcloaks gathering supplies. After defeating the enemies, Hadvar or Ralof will advise you to go through the barrels for any valuables they may contain. Continuing down, you will arrive at an interrogation room, where a battle between an Imperial torturer, his assistant, and some Stormcloak soldiers is taking place, prompting you to fight with whichever enemies your escort is not aligned with. If you are with Hadvar, he has a conversation with the torturer, trying to convince him to come; his attempts prove futile, however, as only the assistant torturer follows. If you're with Ralof, he has a quick conversation with the surviving Stormcloaks, who will both choose to join your party. Hadvar/Ralof will then point to a cage with a dead mage and several valuables inside it (including mage robes, and hood and a Sparks spell tome), offering you several lockpicks, and suggesting you pick the lock to get to the items. If you are not near Hadvar/Ralof when he offers you the picks, you will not get them, but there are a couple of picks in the room in the corner that also contains an iron shield and iron mace, as well as four picks inside a knapsack laying on a small table near the cells. The table also holds a copy of The Book of the Dragonborn. There are two empty, locked cells on either side of the dead mage, and two other locked cells down the hall (this is a safe chance to practice the lockpicking skill, as well as learning the game mechanic). Continue down the corridor past some prison cells which can be unlocked for some minor loot, and through another prison room, and you will eventually enter a natural cave, filled with either Imperial soldiers guarding it for General Tullius, or some lost Stormcloaks. There is an oil spill that can be set alight to damage the enemies on the upper level using the Flames spell. After killing them, you will find a raised drawbridge obstructing your path. A nearby lever can be used to lower the bridge, which will subsequently be destroyed by falling rubble shortly after you cross it. Continuing on, you will come to a skeleton near the passage leading towards another large cavern inhabited by several frostbite spiders. Near the skeleton is an iron dagger, a potion of minor healing, and a coin purse. Once you defeat the spiders, head through a passage leading deeper into the caverns. In the next chamber, near an underground stream, you will encounter a resting bear. Ralof/Hadvar will advise you to sneak past it, but he will give you a bow and some arrows in case you choose to ambush it. Fighting the bear is not too difficult with Hadvar/Ralof helping you. Afterwards, follow Hadvar/Ralof and exit the cave through a crevice in the rock. Leaving the dungeon, you'll see Alduin flying off into the distance, towards the north, completing the quest. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: Unbound (10 points/Bronze)"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Under_New_Management","Attend the ceremony. Receive the Guild Master's Armor from Tonilia. Periodically, search the Guild Master's Tribute Chest for loot.","Improving the Thieves Guild[edit] Note: This section only describes prerequisites for this quest. The quest will not begin until you complete all prerequisites. In order to restore the Thieves Guild to its former glory and assume the title of Guild Master, you must perform small jobs in four holds of Skyrim: Haafingar, the Reach, Whiterun, and Eastmarch. To get an improvement job, talk to Delvin Mallory or Vex; you can have one quest active from each. Once you have completed five jobs in a particular hold (except the Rift, where the Guild already has influence), Delvin will offer you a special ""reputation"" job to increase the Thieves Guild's influence there. You may start taking these jobs at any time after officially joining the guild (completing Taking Care of Business). Completing all four reputation jobs is a prerequisite to becoming the Guild Master. You are assigned targets at random, without regard to the number of jobs that you've already taken in a particular hold.  You can check your Quests log to review how many jobs you've completed per hold. You can accept and quit the jobs at will, which can be used to your advantage if you are assigned jobs in holds that you have already completed, and if you wish to increase your efficiency by matching two jobs to the same hold. If one of Vex's jobs will take place in the same hold as Delvin's, such as a sweep job and a bedlam job both in Eastmarch, then the value of the objects assigned to be stolen in Vex's jobs also applies to targets in Delvins's Bedlam jobs, and both can be completed together. This is an easy way to steal two birds with one... theft. However, there are fewer jobs offered in the Reach (Markarth) than in the other three holds, so it's best to take any job there that you can get. All failed jobs will be listed in the completed quests list. For each reputation job that you complete, the Thieves Guild's headquarters is incrementally improved. Each successful completion adds a merchant to the Ragged Flagon, and completing the third and fourth jobs adds recruits to the guild. Completing these jobs also increases the gold available to all of your fences up to a maximum of 4,000. In addition, gradual cosmetic improvements occur in the Ragged Flagon - Cistern; a carpet will be placed in the center platform in the middle of the room, and banners of the Thieves Guild will be emblazoned on the walls. Also, when you are arrested in a hold over which the Thieves Guild has influence, you will be given an option to bribe guards even if you don't have the Bribery skill perk. The four ""reputation"" quests are activated when the quota is reached for jobs in a given hold: Hold  Quest   Whiterun Imitation Amnesty: Help get a convicted prisoner released from jail.   The Reach Silver Lining: Recover a stolen silver mold for a silversmith.   Eastmarch Summerset Shadows: Remove a rival guild from the picture.   Haafingar The Dainty Sload: Frame a ship's captain to get revenge for a jilted merchant. Ceremony[edit] Once you have completed all of the reputation quests and Darkness Returns, you will be told to talk to Brynjolf about becoming the new Guild Master. (If you do Darkness Returns before the Guild is fully restored, you will automatically get this quest after completing the last reputation quest.) When you enter the Cistern, a crowd will be gathered, including the Thieves Guild regulars, Karliah, and Maven Black-Briar. After you speak to Brynjolf, there is a short ceremony, during which he confirms with Delvin, Vex, and Karliah that you are to be named as the Guild Master. After the ceremony, you must again talk to Brynjolf, who will hand you the Tribute Chest Key and the Amulet of Articulation. The key unlocks the chest near the Guild Master's desk. The Guild periodically places loot in here as a tribute to you, and you are free to take it. Brynjolf also tells you to see Tonilia about getting your Guild Master's Armor set. The Guild Master's Armor set appears graphically similar to the set Mercer Frey wears, and is a recolored variant of your other Thieves Guild Armor with superior stats. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked at the end of this quest: One with the Shadows (30 points/Silver) — Return the Thieves Guild to its former glory"
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Under_Saarthal","Meet Tolfdir and the trainees outside Saarthal. Follow Tolfdir into the ruins. Find Arniel Gane and help him find some artifacts. Use the Saarthal Amulet to escape the trap. Follow Tolfdir deeper into the ruins. Discover the danger within Saarthal. Talk to the Arch-Mage and receive your reward.","Meeting at Saarthal[edit] This quest automatically starts at the end of First Lessons, when Tolfdir suggests that visiting the ruins of Saarthal would be an excellent opportunity to learn more about the ""various applications of magic throughout history"". Saarthal's location is added to your map (if you have not yet discovered it yourself), and Tolfdir and the other College of Winterhold students will start travelling there. They walk the entire distance, meaning that it is easily possible to travel to Saarthal more quickly than any of your companions. It takes them at least four in-game hours to make the trip, longer if they have to deal with multiple enemies (however, all of the students are given protected status at the start of the quest, meaning they are not at risk of being killed along the way). If you are trying to find them en route, they walk from the College into the town of Winterhold, then turn onto a path that leads west from behind the Jarl's Longhouse. You may find it convenient to do another quest in between First Lessons and Under Saarthal, instead of waiting at the ruins for Tolfdir to show up. When Tolfdir arrives at Saarthal, you can advance the quest by selecting the dialogue option, ""I'm ready. Let's go."" At that point, the door to Saarthal unlocks and you can enter. You can select the ""I'm ready"" dialogue before Tolfdir actually gets all the way to the entrance—the dialogue option becomes available at the top of the stairs leading down into the excavation pit (at the same point where you are first told that you have discovered Saarthal). You do not need to wait for the other students before proceeding with the quest; any missing students will appear as soon as you enter Saarthal. If you choose to delay before proceeding with this quest, Tolfdir and the students will stand around outside Saarthal, indefinitely. Tolfdir will still offer services, including selling Alteration spell books, without triggering the quest. Second Lessons[edit] .mw-parser-output table.notice-default{background-color:#FFFFEE;border:1px solid #CCCCBA;clear:both;margin:0 auto 1em auto;padding:0.2em;text-align:left;width:80%}.mw-parser-output table.notice-blue{background-color:#EEEEFF;border-color:#AAAAFF}.mw-parser-output table.notice-cyan{background-color:#EEFFFF;border-color:#AAFFFF}.mw-parser-output table.notice-green{background-color:#EEFFEE;border-color:#CCFFCC}.mw-parser-output table.notice-pink{background-color:#FFEEEE;border-color:#FFAAAA}.mw-parser-output table.notice-red{background-color:#FFCCCC;border-color:#AA9999}.mw-parser-output table.notice-white{background-color:#FFFFEE;border-color:#CCCCBA}.mw-parser-output table.notice-yellow{background-color:#FFFFCC;border-color:#CCCC66} This article focuses on the Under Saarthal quest, specifically how to complete all the quest objectives. For information about the dungeon itself, including locations of all loot, see Saarthal.  Tolfdir will lead you and the other students into the excavation, playing the role of teacher and tour guide: As some of you may know, Saarthal was one of the earliest Nord settlements in Skyrim. It was also the largest. Sacked by the elves in the infamous ""Night of Tears,"" not much is known about what happened to Saarthal. This is an exciting opportunity for us. To be able to study such an early civilization, and the magics they used... When questioned about the importance of Saarthal, he will also tell you that: We're particularly interested in the prevalence of magical seals placed on the tombs here. It's rather unlike anything we've encountered. In spite of Tolfdir's repeated warnings about safety, there are no enemies in the first rooms of the excavation. Each of your fellow students has a different reaction to Saarthal. Onmund is the least happy of the three, repeatedly complaining about being in the burial site of his ancestors: ""There's no chance anyone in authority approved this. Our ancestors should be allowed to rest in peace."" His concerns have evoked some sympathy from Brelyna, who comments, ""To think, my ancestors destroyed the homes of Onmund's ancestors. So much bloodshed."" As usual, J'zargo is only interested in how he might be able to profit from the expedition, ""Do you think there's treasure here? Something to make J'zargo a powerful wizard?"" Once Tolfdir has led you through the first room, he will start handing out assignments to all of his students. Your task is to help Arniel Gane find some artifacts: Ah, yes. Hmm. Well, why don't you see if you can assist Arniel Gane? He's one of our scholars, here working on cataloging our finds. I expect he'd appreciate some help in locating any additional magical artifacts here in the ruins. Any enchanted items will do; the usefulness of the enchantment is irrelevant. If you find anything, the class can look it over. He also has tasks for the other three students, although none of them end up having any luck completing their tasks: For Brelyna: Brelyna, my dear, why don't you search for warding magics. Anything designed to keep people out. Don't interact with them, just identify them. Her subsequent response: I'm not seeing signs of any warding magics at all. Either they're not here, or they were removed long ago. For Onmund: Onmund, please search that area over there. See if you notice any... residual energies. Alive or undead. His subsequent response: I wonder if everyone else would be so happy to rifle through the bones of their ancestors. For J'zargo: J'zargo... what shall we have you do... Ah! Why don't you verify that we're the first ones here? Look for any amount of tampering with the tombs. His subsequent response: J'zargo finds nothing but dust in these ruins. The Saarthal Amulet[edit] The Saarthal Amulet To complete your assignment, you need to venture deeper into the ruin, into the passageways west of the second chamber, where you will find Arniel Gane engrossed in his research. When you interrupt his work, he seems less than excited about having an assistant: Ah, yes. You. I remember you. You're going to help? That's fine. Just... Just don't make a mess of my work. I've only looked through a portion of this section. You, uh, you can look around in the chambers just north of here. Try and be careful, all right? We don't want to damage anything. Although talking to Arniel doesn't give you much new information about your assignment, it does update your quest objective and, even more importantly, adds quest objective markers to each of the four items: three Enchanted Rings and one ""Ancient Amulet"". Finding the three rings is entirely optional and has no effect on the outcome of the quest. They are lying on the floor at three locations in the nearby passageways. Although the rings can be obtained without talking to Arniel, finding the small items without quest markers is very challenging. If you do find one of them on the floor before talking to Arniel, the quest will update and you will have markers for the other two. It is also easier to collect the rings before picking up the Ancient Amulet rather than after—once you have the amulet, your quest objectives update and you lose the quest markers pointing to the rings. At any point after finding the Ancient Amulet, you can return to Arniel Gane and give him any Enchanted Rings that you have found. He takes all the rings from you, but he is more concerned with the mess you have made than with the new artifacts, and does not give you any reward (not even a boost to his disposition). Therefore, you may prefer to instead keep the rings with their +20 Fortify Health enchantment for yourself; they are not quest items and can be freely sold, given to a follower, or disenchanted. Or if you really want to cover all bases, you can pick up just one ring, give it to Arniel, and then pick up the other two, and keep them (Arniel won't even recognize any additional rings after you give him the first one). The only artifact that must be found to advance the quest is the Ancient Amulet. It can be found at the northernmost end of the passageways, suspended in front of a brightly-lit, arched section of the wall. You can actually pick up the Amulet at any point (before even getting the assignment from Tolfdir) if you are in a rush to advance the quest. As soon as you pick up the Amulet, a spear trap activates behind you, locking you into the small space. If Tolfdir is nearby he will suggest that you try using the amulet. In your inventory, it is listed as the Saarthal Amulet (under Apparel), and has an enchantment that reduces spell costs by 3%. More importantly, equipping the amulet will trigger a visible resonance effect in the wall where you found it, causing Tolfdir to suggest ""I wonder... what effect might your spells have?"" This is your hint: casting any targeted spell or shout at the wall while wearing the amulet collapses the wall. The Flames spell given to all players at the start of the game is one possible spell, but any spell or shout cast at a target will work. Collapsing the wall also lowers the barrier behind you, allowing Tolfdir to rush forward. The Psijic Warning[edit] Tolfdir is very excited about the newly-revealed sections of the ruin: ""Well, this is highly unusual. And very interesting. Why in the world would this be sealed off? What is this place?"". You soon learn, however, that other people have also observed your actions, and they are less pleased with this turn of events. Once both you and Tolfdir have made it to the small burial room at the end of the new passageway, a ghostly apparition identified as Nerien appears, with dire warnings: Hold, mage, and listen well... Know that you have set in motion a chain of events that cannot be stopped. Judgment has not been passed, as you had no way of knowing. Judgment will be passed on your actions to come, and how you deal with the dangers ahead of you. This warning is passed to you because the Psijic Order believes in you. You, mage, and you alone, have the potential to prevent disaster. Take great care, and know that the Order is watching. Nerien then vanishes, leaving you alone again with Tolfdir, who clearly did not see or hear the ghost, although he did feel ""something rather strange"". When you tell him what happened, he is perplexed: The Psijic Order? Are you quite sure about that? That's very odd. And danger ahead? Why that doesn't make any sense at all. The Psijics have no connection to these ruins. And no one's seen any of their order in a long time. If you ask him why the Psijic Order is contacting you, he can provide some additional information: I have no idea, but it's fascinating. Assuming it's true, of course. The Isle of Artaeum disappeared over a hundred years ago, and no one has seen them since. And yet now, suddenly, they have chosen to contact you? Why, it's intriguing! If nothing else, I'd take it as a compliment. The Psijics have only ever dealt with those they feel worthy. Tolfdir finishes up by suggesting that the coffins in the room should be searched. Predictably, the coffins contain two leveled draugr, who jump out and attack on Tolfdir's cue. However, the draugr also uncover the way forward, through the back of one of the coffins. The Dragonborn should then follow Tolfdir to a barred gate in a room. Tolfdir will stop and wait there and do absolutely nothing until you pull the lever and open the gate. From this point until the end of the dungeon, Saarthal is a typical Nordic ruin, containing leveled draugr enemies. There is a rotating pillar puzzle in one room; the symbol to match is above and behind each pillar. The second puzzle is like the first: match each pillar with the symbol behind it. The catch is that each of four pillars will turn as many as three of the other pillars with it, so the sequence is critical. The fastest solution is as follows; the second pillar on the left should be turned to whale first (because it turns the other three with it.) Then, the first pillar on the left should be turned to snake (that will turn the two on the right.) Next, the second pillar on the right should be turned to hawk (that one will turn the last one.) And finally, the first one on the right should be turned to whale. The Mysterious Orb[edit] ""Be bound here, Jyrik, murderer, betrayerCondemned by your crimes against realm and lord.May your name and your deeds be forgotten foreverAnd the charm which you bear be sealed by our ward."" Jyrik Gauldurson, in his fire-resistant form After exploring most of the second zone of Saarthal on your own, Tolfdir will catch up with you right before you enter a large room, approaching the end of the dungeon; this effectively alerts you that the quest is resuming. At the far end of this room floats a massive spinning orb, surrounded by a swirling energy barrier. Tolfdir is immediately fascinated by the orb: Well now... would you look at that. I never imagined we'd find something like this. Why is this buried so far within Saarthal? However, he is unable to fully investigate, because approaching the orb attracts the attention of Jyrik Gauldurson, a unique and powerful draugr who has been trapped in Saarthal for eons. Your initial attempts to damage Jyrik will inevitably fail, because he is drawing energy from the orb to make himself invincible. Once Tolfdir realizes what is happening he rushes down to the orb and works on severing the connection between Jyrik and the orb. After four seconds, Tolfdir starts to cast a lightning-like spell at the barrier surrounding the orb, which succeeds in making Jyrik vulnerable. Tolfdir spends the rest of the battle maintaining his spell, leaving you to take care of actually attacking Jyrik. Jyrik is still a challenging enemy, in part because of a rotating elemental shield. Once you have killed him, be sure to loot his corpse for the Gauldur Amulet Fragment and Writ of Sealing, both of which are necessary for the Forbidden Legend quest; if you had not previously started this quest, reading the writ or taking the amulet fragment will trigger it. The Staff of Jyrik Gauldurson can also be found nearby. Jyrik's death also causes the energy barrier around the orb to disappear, allowing Tolfdir to at last examine the orb more closely (and also allowing you to access a door behind the orb). When asked what he thinks it is, he replies: I have no idea! This is amazing. Absolutely amazing. The Arch-Mage needs to be informed immediately. He needs to see this for himself. I don't dare leave this unattended. Can you return to the College and inform Savos Aren of this discovery? Please, hurry. If you ask for more specific instructions about what to tell the Arch-Mage, he suggests: Let him know that we've unearthed something... Well, I'm not sure. Something unique, let's say. It's clearly magical in nature, but like nothing I've ever seen before. He should be most interested. Take advantage of the door behind the orb to discover a shortcut back to the entrance of Saarthal—and don't miss the Ice Form Word Wall and boss chest along the way.  Wrapping Up[edit] Back at the College, talk to Savos Aren, whose previously inaccessible Arch-Mage's Quarters have now been unlocked. His initial reaction is amusing: Please don't tell me that another one of the apprentices has been incinerated. I have enough to deal with right now. You can choose between two follow-up responses, either ""We've found something in Saarthal, and Tolfdir thinks it's important."" or ""We found some sort of... orb. Tolfdir wanted you to see it."" Both have the same ultimate result, although Savos seems somewhat unimpressed by the latter response. In the end, he thanks you and rewards you with a Staff of Magelight (suggesting that it may come in handy if you explore any more Nordic Ruins). He also tells you to check with Urag gro-Shub for any possible leads regarding the nature of the artifact, initiating the Hitting the Books quest. Completing this quest also has several advantageous effects. Your rank in the College of Winterhold is increased from Student (rank 0) to Apprentice (rank 1), and your disposition with Tolfdir is increased. Multiple radiant quests related to the College of Winterhold are also enabled once Under Saarthal is complete, namely Brelyna's Practice, J'zargo's Experiment, and Onmund's Request. If you wish to start any of these quests right away, rush back to Saarthal and catch any of the four quest-givers as they start their slow walk back to the College of Winterhold. If it is night, after sleeping in your bed for one hour, they will appear in the Hall of Attainment. Otherwise, they can eventually be found around the college. Tolfdir's radiant quest, Tolfdir the Absent-Minded is also triggered by the completion of Under Saarthal, however, to start that quest Tolfdir must also be located in the College. Since Tolfdir stays in Saarthal to continue watching over the orb, his quest can only be started when Hitting the Books is nearly complete (Tolfdir returns when, behind the scenes, the orb itself is moved to the college)."

Speak to Romlyn Dreth and you'll find out that he is the source of the problem. He can be found in the lower level of the meadery at roughly after 1pm and The Bee and Barb in the evening. Romlyn has been selling Black-Briar Mead from underneath the meadery at a lower cost. He states that he can no longer get the mead out of Riften and offers to cut you in on the action if you deliver the mead to his customer. Delivering the Mead[edit] Should you choose to deliver the mead for Romlyn all you need to do is take it to Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead. The bartender there is named Wilhelm and will thank you for the delivery offering you some leveled jewelry in return. You can speak to Romlyn again to make additional deliveries.[verification needed — one time quest in SSE] Turning in Romlyn[edit] All you need to do to turn in Romlyn is speak to Indaryn and select the special dialogue option.

Return to Kolbjorn Barrow and clear the draugr. Speak to Ralis, fund 5,000 gold to his excavation, and await another message. Return to Kolbjorn Barrow and locate Ralis. Defeat Ahzidal and confront Ralis; decide what to do with him.","A Strange Partnership[edit] Just northeast of the Old Attius Farm is Kolbjorn Barrow. Outside Kolbjorn Barrow is a lone Dunmer named Ralis Sedarys. Go up and talk to him and he'll explain that he is a treasure hunter and has come with news that he has located a treasure in the barrow, but he cannot afford to excavate it alone and requests a donation of 1,000 gold, with a promise of a share of any treasure discovered. First Visit[edit] A few days after you give him the money, a courier will give you a note about the barrow. Head off over to the barrow, and Ralis will explain that the draugr have been disturbed, and they have killed all the miners. He asks you to go in and kill the draugr and then find a way further into the barrow. After you have killed the draugr, take the Skull off the altar to open the next area, Go into the next room and pick up the Ahzidal's Boots of Waterwalking. (If the skull has been knocked off the pressure plate on the altar during the fight it must be lifted back onto the plinth and removed once more, or you can ""walk"" onto it and off by getting on the altar). Go back and talk to Ralis. He'll then ask for 2,000 gold to hire some more miners. Second Visit[edit] Several days afterward you'll get another note asking you to come back to the barrow. There are more draugr and two of the miners are missing. He asks that you locate the missing miners and to kill the remaining draugr. Before you get to Mireli, there is a gate with 4 handles arranged vertically to the right of the gate. Do not pull the third (from the top), as it releases a dart trap. Pull the switches in the following order: first, second, fourth, first. In the last section of the mine near the corpse of Mireli is a handle (near the floor on the other side of the wall with candles, a soul gem and coins) that can be turned to reveal a secret room where Ahzidal's Ring of Necromancy can be found. Note that although you will hear the sounds of a nearby word wall, it will not be accessible until a later visit. Ralis now wants 3,000 gold to hire some mercenaries. Third Visit[edit] You will receive a third letter a few days later, asking you to return to the barrow. When the courier delivers the letter, he will tell you ""Another letter from Ralis. He's starting to scare me a little"", a portent of things to come. Ralis will tell a similar story as last time: that there are yet more draugr, and that this time they have killed all the mercenaries that he hired. Enter the barrow and kill the draugr. To access Ahzidal's Gauntlets of Warding, pull the chain to the right of the iron doors that lead to the staircase into the newly excavated section, then backtrack around the corner where they will be sitting on a pedestal that was previously unavailable. Then, head down the stairs, avoiding the trap, and kill the new draugr. When you reach the open chamber, you must ensure all the pressure plates are lit for the gate to open and reach Ahzidal's Ring of Arcana. (The Light Foot perk does not prevent you from lighting the pressure plates.) The timing is a bit tight; if you can't get it, using Slow Time seems to work, or you can run along the joint between two rows of tiles, depressing both rows at once, for a total of three runs across the grid. You can also circumvent the puzzle entirely with Telekinesis. A pit filled with deep water surrounds the plinth that the ring is on. At the bottom you can find a coin purse, a burial urn and a leveled battleaxe. Once you're done here, head up the stairs and back out of the barrow to talk to Ralis who now wants 5,000 more gold. He will then send you one last note, which simply reads ""You're needed."" A Poor Investment[edit] When you get the final note, return to the barrow and look for clues at the camp, then head into the barrow and clear it out. You are finally able to reach the word wall which teaches a word for the Cyclone shout. On reaching the room with all the pressure plates on the floor, follow the passage to the left. A gate will close behind you will have to fight three draugr.  The gate blocking access to Ahzidal's Armor of Retribution can be opened by rotating the two animal totem pillars until the whale symbols are facing you, then pulling the lever on the floor.  Rotate the two animal totem pillars until the eagle symbols are facing you and pull the lever on the floor again to open the gate you came in, and the gate over the spiral staircase. At the bottom of the staircase, the gate blocking access to Ahzidal's Helm of Vision can be opened by rotating the two animal totem pillars until the snake symbols are facing you, then pulling the chain next to the door. There is a giant pool of oil encompassing almost the entire room, so it is recommended that you intentionally ignite it safely from the staircase as pulling the chain with an incorrect pillar arrangement will cause several flame spout traps to blast the area in front of the gate. Removing the helm from its pedestal will activate another flame spout trap that is aimed back towards the gate. You may use Telekinesis again, but the flame jet will still travel far enough to ignite the oil. There is a Stalhrim source to the left of the helm chamber. After battling several leveled draugr, you will eventually find Ralis completing the ritual to awaken a dragon priest named Ahzidal. Defeat Ahzidal, loot his eponymous mask, then speak to Ralis, who will explain that he was under a spell. You can then choose to kill him or let him live, in which case he will become available as a follower. If you kill him, you may loot Hoarfrost, a unique ancient Nordic pickaxe, from his corpse. You can also take it from him if you spare him. You can find the Black Book Filament and Filigree at the end of the exit tunnel."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Unfathomable_Depths","Accept the Lexicon from From-Deepest-Fathoms. Return the Lexicon to Avanchnzel.","Memory Remains[edit] From-Deepest-Fathoms wandering the Riften docks Once you reach level 14, a female Argonian named From-Deepest-Fathoms will appear near  Riften Fishery, walking around in circles, manically talking to herself. When you approach her, she will tell you about a place called Avanchnzel and an item she refers to as ""the Lexicon"": ""You. You must take the Lexicon. Free me of my burden.""  When you respond, she merely continues: ""The memories. I cannot stand them. You must take them away, return them to Avanchnzel. You must take the Lexicon from me. Please... take it now."" She will not provide any explanations and will continue rambling until you accept. She then hands you a strange, ornately-decorated cube, and will walk away with the words: ""You must bring it to Avanchnzel, in the west. Return it to them. It must go back."" Four Thieves[edit] Avanchnzel is a large Dwemer ruin in southernmost Skyrim, in the Jerall Mountains, a long ways west of Riften and southwest of Heartwood Mill. The exterior of the ruin is quite large, promising a lengthy journey within.  The entrance itself is a cave-like opening in the cliff rather than a Dwemer-crafted stone door. Immediately upon entering, the hidden power of the Lexicon begins to awaken, and you will hear ghostly voices echoing through the tunnels. When you reach the first chamber, you will encounter four ghostly figures: Drennen, Breya, Watches-The-Roots and From-Deepest-Fathoms, the same Argonian who gave you the Lexicon back in Riften. The conversation between them reveals that Roots is the leader, while he and Fathoms have hired Breya and Drennen. Drennen is clearly the newcomer and is already worried about what lurks within Avanchnzel: Drennen: ""I don't like this place. It feels like we're being... watched.""   Breya: ""It's a simple job, Drennen. We get in, we steal the Lexicon, we leave. Don't get jumpy.""   Fathoms: ""If you two cannot handle this, we can find others to hire.""   Roots: ""Enough. Their services will be more than adequate. Let us continue."" The ghosts will then disappear without a trace.  When you continue forward, you will notice a broken-down wall that leads into the actual ruin; clearly made by the ghostly adventurers. Inside the ruin, dwarven spiders immediately attack, so dispose of them and proceed through the empty halls until you reach a door. Avanchnzel is Waiting[edit] The next chamber is the central chamber, with multiple levels and bridges leading up to plateaus above. Two ghosts will be present on the bridge, the young Drennen and the more experienced Watches-The-Roots. Roots clearly did his homework and tells Drennen the purpose of Avanchnzel: Drennen: ""This place is unbelievable.""   Roots: ""Indeed. Avanchnzel is as much a library as it is a city. Built to hold the vast memories of the Dwemer."" ""Why are all these metal... things... ignoring us?"" After this brief exchange the two ghosts will disappear, leaving you with two possible paths: east and south. Since the ghosts were heading south, pick that route and fight your way through numerous dwarven spheres as the path twists and turns, leading down like a spiral. When you reach the large central chamber again, you will find yourself on the level below the bridge, and you will be attacked by four dwarven spiders. Make your way to the very bottom and check out the door to the south for a bit of treasure, then follow the map marker to the eastern door. Here, all four ghosts are present again, curiously staring at some buzzing dwarven automatons: Breya: ""Why are all these metal... things... ignoring us?""   Roots: ""Anavchnzel [sic] is waiting.""   Breya: ""Waiting for what?""   Roots: ""No one seems to know. Perhaps the return of the Dwemer. Perhaps the end of the world.""   Breya: ""Best get rid of the ones we see. Just in case."" When the ghosts and the machinery are gone, proceed down the corridor. There is an unlocked chest with some minor loot near the shell of the left hand Dwemer sphere. Collect it if you wish and then enter the next zone, the Avanchnzel Animoncultory. Accumulated Memories[edit] ""I told you we should have hired a thief."" ""Maybe we should turn back. I don't want to sleep here."" In the first chamber of the Animoncultory, you will yet again encounter the ghosts, this time trying to break into one of the many hidden chambers of Avanchnzel. At this point, it is clear the place is starting to get to them: Breya: ""I told you we should have hired a thief.""   Fathoms: ""We are thieves, you fool. We're stealing the cube.""   Breya: ""And yet none of us can pick a damned lock."" When the ghosts are gone, pick the lock for some minor loot, then proceed up the stairs and follow the tunnels to another large chamber with a tiny camp set up by the adventurers.  Here, you will watch their growing frustrations with each other and the task at hand: Drennen: ""This place is huge.""   Roots: ""It is large, indeed. I did not anticipate Avanchnzel's size or the time needed to uncover the entrance. A few hours sleep and we should be ready to continue through.""   Drennen: ""Maybe we should turn back. I don't want to sleep here.""   Roots: ""Drennen, you do understand that the Lexicon at the bottom of this place holds the accumulated memories of centuries of Dwemer.""   Breya: ""Not to mention our pay.""   Drennen: ""So?""   Fathoms: ""So we're not turning back, you fool.""   Breya: ""Besides, you're not scared of a few sleeping metal men. Are you, Drennen?"" Head east from the camping area and follow the tunnel as it turns north. Beware the booby-trapped door to the east, as the spinning blades from the floor can kill you instantly. Turn around the corner and approach the northern side of the huge chamber with the camp. It contains a single dwarven spider, numerous dwemer artifacts on shelves, an alchemy lab, and some jewelry. From there, take the southern corridor, which leads one level down to another door. A dwarven spider and dwemer sphere guard the next room, and several locked doors lead to extra treasure. Keep moving in a western direction until you reach a chamber with yet another ghostly encounter: Breya: ""I thought you said these things were ""sleeping""?""   Roots: ""You said they were sleeping. I said they were waiting. It seems a few of them were ""waiting"" for someone to try and take the Lexicon.""   Breya: ""Great."" Head down the southern corridor and open the door. A gigantic factory will appear before you, filled to the brink with dwarven spiders, as well as several dwarven centurions and spheres lying on tables, ready to attack if needed. With the exception of the spiders, none of them will attack, so locate the northern staircase and head down the slope to find the first evidence of what happened to the adventurers. The Lexicon[edit] ""Drennen!"" ""Soon the Lexicon's knowledge will be mine."" At the foot of the slope, you will find the dead body of one of the ghosts: the young Drennen. Around the corner, you will see the ghostly version of Drennen finally lose it and run towards you, disappearing exactly where his body lies. His final words—""I can't do this. We shouldn't be here. I'm sorry.""—will be largely ignored by his companions, who, unaware that Drennen died just after turning the corner, will decide to move on: Breya: ""Drennen!""   Fathoms: ""Let the field mouse run. Your pay will be double.""   Breya: ""My pay will be nothing if we die in here!""   Roots: ""Calm yourself, Breya. We are closing in on the Lexicon. I can feel it calling. We'll continue without Drennen."" The three ghosts will then move on into the Avanchnzel Boilery, so follow them inside. There you will witness yet another conversation, where a seemingly-possessed Roots will claim he can hear the Lexicon calling: Roots: ""We are close now. Can you hear the Lexicon calling out?""   Fathoms: ""Sure.""   Breya: ""So we grab it and we get out, right?""   Roots: ""Once we have the Lexicon, we'll need to take it to its podium. I know what to do from there. Soon the Lexicon's knowledge will be mine.""'   Fathoms: ""Ours. Soon the Lexicon's knowledge will be ours.""   Roots: ""Of course."" Unfathomable Depths[edit] ""I can hear the Lexicon. Come on. Quickly!"" The End of the Road Walk down the pathway and through the steamy tunnel. A dwarven sphere will attack along the way, and you will encounter a dwarven spider sitting on a set of shelves, shivering. In the next room, you will see Roots, Breya, and Fathoms carefully approaching a door at the end of the room. The obsessed Roots will say: Roots: ""We're almost there. I can hear the Lexicon. Come on. Quickly!""   Breya: ""Something doesn't feel right."" The three will then approach the door and Breya will shout, ""Wait!"" and Roots will cry out, ""Aaaaaaaaaaa...."" Behind the door, a set of pressure plates will transform the entire room into a deathtrap of nearly unavoidable spinning blades. At the bottom of the slope you will find Watches-The-Roots dead, obviously killed by the blades. You can turn off the trap with the handle near his body, then open the nearby door for the final showdown. In the last chamber, Breya's body can be found dead near the pedestal, killed by the dwarven centurion lying next to her.  Impressively, she appears to have killed one of them before dying herself, no mean feat.  Unfortunately, there was one more centurion in the room; it is likely responsible for her death.  As soon as you approach the pedestal, it will activate, intent on making you its next kill.  After the battle, locate the Lexicon Receptacle in the middle of the room and place the Lexicon on it. Once it is in place, behold the sight of power and memories as it opens.  Your reward for following in the footsteps of some unfortunate adventurers is the passive effect Ancient Knowledge. To leave the ruin, open the western door; there is an unlocked boss chest in the darkness to your left as you approach the elevator, easily missed.  Take the elevator up to the first zone, Avanchnzel, and fight a few enemies. Locate the door with the wooden bar to the north and escape out onto the Avanchnzel Balcony, an exterior area that provides a breathtaking view over Skyrim. To the right is a locked Apprentice level chest containing minor loot."

Follow Harald at night and enter the secret chamber within Quicksilver Mine. Kill Fenrik and his minions to destroy the Daedric cult.","Missing Vigilants[edit] To start this quest, you must read the Letter to Keeper Carcette in the Hall of the Vigilant. Note that this location will be destroyed once you reach level 10 or start the quest Dawnguard. If it has been destroyed, the letter can be found on or underneath a table within the ruined building. Reading this letter will reveal that several members of the Vigil of Stendarr have gone missing, and a Vigilant named Azarain has decided to journey to Dawnstar to investigate. You must first travel to the Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar to look for clues as to Azarain's whereabouts. A mysterious note in one of the rooms appears to have lured Azarain to the nearby Windward Ruins outside of town. Journey there and you will find his corpse, wearing a full set of the new Vigil Veteran armor which can be looted. You must read his journal to discover that Azarain's old partner Fenrik had come to Dawnstar to investigate rumors of a Daedric cult. Azarain had discovered that the cult uses poisoned Elven daggers to perform their killings, and he had narrowed down his investigation to three primary suspects:  Harald, Irine, and Vereth. Follow the Clues[edit] Irine can be found wandering around Dawnstar, near the Windpeak Inn. Vereth can be found inside the inn. Harald is a miner and can be found working inside Quicksilver Mine down by the docks. Your journal will suggest that you try pickpocketing each of them to identify which one might be a cult member. You do not need to steal anything to update the journal, and this step can be skipped entirely if you prefer. Instead, you are presented with the option of following each of the three at night to see if they will lead you to the Daedric cult. The correct person to follow is Harald, who can be found carrying an Elven dagger if you choose to pick his pocket. Wait until nighttime inside Quicksilver Mine, until all of the miners stop working. Rather than exit the mine, Harald will begin to walk deeper inside, before vanishing behind a rock wall. Sneak up behind him and activate the button on the wall to uncover a secret entrance to a large natural cavern. Irine and Vereth, meanwhile, are innocent: Irine's nocturnal wanderings take her to a shrine of Dibella a little way south of Dawnstar, while Vereth visits the lighthouse northeast of town and stands gazing out over the sea. The blood altar Grim loot found within Temple to Molag Bal[edit] This cavern, it is revealed, has been converted into a temple to Molag Bal. It contains a large central blood altar surrounded by coffins, many of which are filled with dead Vigilants of Stendarr. You must kill Harald along with the vampire Fenrik and his three other thralls. Killing all of the enemies will complete the quest, although Fenrik's Journal goes on to explain what had happened to lead to these disappearances. It reveals that Fenrik had become infected with vampirism and had sought a cure, which was blasphemous in the eyes of his fellow Vigilants who believe that vampires are unredeemable monstrosities. To cure his disease, Fenrik petitioned Lord Molag Bal to lift the curse, and in return Bal demanded that he sacrifice nine of his fellow Vigilants (one for each of the Nine Divines). Fenrik's body can also be looted for a full set of Vigil Corrupted armor. A set of Vigil Enforcer armor can be looted from the corpse of one of the sacrificed Vigilants. Finally, a set of Vigil Silver Hand armor can be found lying on a table on the northeastern side of the cavern, next to the bloody red bones of the previous wearer. All four of the new armor sets can also be crafted at a forge once you've completed this quest, provided you have the Steel Smithing perk."

Speak to Serana.","A Canticle Tree Ancestor Moths surrounding the player Finding Ancestor Glade[edit] As instructed by Dexion Evicus, your first task is to acquire a Moth Priest's draw knife from the Ancestor Glade northeast of Falkreath. Take the eastern road out of Falkreath and at the first four-way intersection you come across, head northeast. Soon after negotiating the bandit bridge guarding the approach to Pinewatch, turn south onto a narrow mountain trail. After climbing for a while you will come across a bandit camp; from here press on to the southwest and continue climbing high into the mountain. The entrance to the cave is marked by a series of cairns. Reading the Elder Scrolls The vision Ancestor Glade[edit] If you told Serana to leave you, she will be back with you once you enter the cave. Head deeper into the cave, up a ledge and across a fallen tree trunk until you emerge into a large hidden clearing. Having been initially unimpressed by the glade, Serana will now gasp in astonishment at the sight before you. Descend down the path towards the stream bisecting the carvern; in particular, make for the glowing tree on the eastern side, just by some rapids. Here you will find a ring-shaped stone with a draw knife lodged inside it. Using the Draw Knife[edit] Activate the stone to acquire the draw knife (note that from this point a gate bars your exit from the cavern) and use it on the canticle tree just to the north. Once you have obtained some bark, you will need to attract seven Ancestor Moth swarms. There are swarms moving all across the Glade, which you can attract by standing next to them for some time. As soon as you have seven swarms following you, a shaft of unnatural light will illuminate the stone knife holder. Return there and read the Elder Scroll (Blood), which will actually cause you to read all three scrolls. Reading the Elder Scrolls[edit] After reading the Scrolls, you have a vision of a glowing map with lines for rivers and with two notable features glowing red: in the lower left the ram of Markarth and in the upper right the wolf of Solitude. The location of Auriel's Bow is shown by the small white symbol, similar to the Elder glyph , near the head of the river in the top-left quarter of the map. Talk To Serana[edit] Once the vision fades, Serana will immediately come over and ask if everything is alright. She will ask about Auriel's Bow's location and you will be able to point her to Darkfall Cave thanks to your vision, thus completing the quest.

Brynjolf decides that more intelligence is needed on Mercer's plans and asks you break into Riftweald Manor to see what you can find out—with impunity. The Watchdog[edit] Ask Brynjolf about Riftweald Manor and he will mention a ""trained watchdog"" guarding the house; a man named Vald that Mercer is extorting. Brynjolf suggests you speak to Vex for more on Vald.  Vex has a few choice words about Vald, but will also tell you that he is working for Mercer Frey because of a debt he owes to Maven Black-Briar.  Clearing the debt is suggested as one way to get Vald to stop guarding Mercer's house. The Queen Bee and the Quill[edit] To learn the details of the debt, track down Maven, who can typically be found at The Bee and Barb. She tells you that years ago she commissioned a unique quill from Winterhold. Vald was to deliver the quill to her, but he lost it at the bottom of Lake Honrich, outside of Riften. The location of the quill shown on the local map From Riften Stables, head southwest until you reach the edge of the lake. Ahead, you should see a large ship docked at Riften. Swim towards the westernmost end of that ship and look west across the lake towards Goldenglow Estate to see a similar ship docked there. Halfway to the other boat, the prow of Vald's sunken rowboat can be found at the bottom of the lake. For reference, a small island to the north will mark the halfway point. You'll see half a boat prow sticking out of the ground and the quill is located in Vald's Strongbox (leveled lock) (map). Pick it, take the quill and a leveled amount of gold, then head back to find Maven. She'll hand you a note to take to Vald. Clearing the way[edit] Head to the back gate of Riftweald Manor and wait there until Vald comes to talk to you. Inform him that you have erased his debt, and he will want to do you a good turn as well, giving you the key to the Manor and opening the back gate for you."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Vile_Whispers","Enter Champion's Rest and read the Vigilant's Report. Explore the dungeon until you come face-to-face with Umbra. Attack Umbra when he loses his invulnerability and take the Umbra Sword from his corpse.","Ghostly Sightings[edit] Head to Champion's Rest, a Nordic ruin which has recently been uncovered in a silver mine east of Shor's Stone. To start the quest, find and read the Vigilant's Report from a Vigilant of Stendarr who previously investigated the site after reports that the miners saw a ghost within the ruins wielding a whispering sword. The Vigilant identified the sword as Umbra, a sentient Daedric artifact long thought to have been destroyed. After reading the report, you will task yourself with finding the source of this dark presence to prevent any harm befalling Shor's Stone. Puzzle solution for the western chamber Puzzle solution for the eastern chamber After passing through the short silver mine, you will enter the Nordic ruins themselves. Several skeevers can be found in a chamber to the left; to the right, you will enter a chamber only to come face-to-face with the ghost himself: a purple spirit who quickly vanishes. Venture deeper inside and you will find yourself in a huge chamber surrounded by sealed draugr sarcophagi and unlit blue braziers. At the opposite end of the chamber is a doubly-locked gate. Activating the nearby levers will do nothing. You will instead need to explore the two side passages, both of which contain spinning totem puzzles. Both side passages contain leveled draugr enemies. The totem solutions themselves are partially obscured, with one totem being almost totally hidden beneath rubble. The eastern chamber's solution is Snake—Hawk—Whale. Pull the nearby lever to activate the eastern braziers, but be careful as you will be hit by a dart trap if you select the wrong totems. Once one side of the chamber is lit up, you will be able to activate the corresponding lever to partially lower the gate. However, solving each puzzle will also release a wave of draugr from their tombs. The western chamber's solution is Snake—Snake—Whale, but again beware that the level will activate a flamethrower statue trap, which will ignite the surrounding oil slick if you haven't done so already. With both puzzles solved, the braziers on both sides of the main chamber will be lit by a cold blue flame and you will be able to fully lower the gate. Progress further in and defeat the boss-level draugr (which may be a dragon priest at higher levels) and enter the second area of the ruins, Champion's Rest Amphitheater. A Vile Presence[edit] The first section of the Amphitheater zone consists of narrow waterlogged hallways filled with various traps activated by hidden pressure plates. You will come to an open area containing oil lanterns; descend to the bottom level and continue onward into the eerie blue crypts. You will again come across the ghost as you explore this area. Umbra awaits you in an ancient Nordic arena At the end of the crypts, you will enter into a huge natural cavern featuring a rock-hewn gladiatorial arena. In the center of the arena, you will find the ""ghost"", who is in fact an ebony-clad Imperial warrior named Umbra. He is immune to all damage while purple and translucent, but he will repeatedly summon three soul images to fight you, during which time he will materialize and will be vulnerable to damage. Be sure not to allow the soul images to gang up on you, as two of them use bound swords and another will shoot from a distance with a bound bow. After a short period, Umbra will reabsorb his soul images and cast an extremely powerful area of effect Destruction spell, which includes frost and fire damage spells. Should you survive the boss fight and do enough damage to Umbra while he is not invulnerable, he will fall dead, allowing you to claim the sword as well as the Champion's Rest Passage Key granting access to his inner sanctum and a short escape route out of the dungeon. Taking the sword will end the quest. Loot the chest in the northeast corner of the arena and make your way to the southern exit. Inside Umbra's living quarters, you will find a small camp along with a bowl full of skeever tails and a Treasure Hunter's Journal explaining how the now deceased Imperial man had ended up in the tomb and how Umbra bent him to his will until their psyches fused. A secret tunnel will lead you back to the ruin's entrance, allowing for a quick escape."

He may tell you about a pack of werewolves in the mountains and advise you to talk to the hunters up at Frostmoon Crag to know more. Alternatively, you might run into a wandering hunter in the northern areas of Solstheim who will tell you about the pack at Frostmoon Crag. Although he will mention the pack to anyone, the quest will only start this way if you're a werewolf and you haven't already heard the rumors from Geldis. Travel to Frostmoon Crag and you can find four hunters there. Rakel will come up to you and stop you from getting too close. ""Hold, traveler. You have no business here."" If you're not a werewolf, she will ask you to go away and leave them in peace. ""We mean you no harm, but... be on your way."" Staying around will lead her to give you some warnings. They will transform into werewolves and attack you after the last warning. If she finds the beast blood in your body, she will say ""...Wait. You... you're one of us, aren't you? A werewolf?"" Then she will introduce the Frostmoon Pack to you and welcome you as a brother or sister. Now, you may talk to Majni, Alpha of the Frostmoon Pack, and complete the quest.

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Volskygge_(quest)","Note: This quest does not appear in your journal. Locate Volskygge. Fight your way through the ruin. Defeat the dragon priest Volsung.","A Wall, Black as Night[edit] ""It is a cursed place...!"" When you visit Solitude, the local guards may warn you about an ancient Nordic ruin called Volskygge, saying: ""If you must venture southwest, stay clear of Volskygge. It is a cursed place, a tomb where the dead still live...."" Talking to experienced traveler Jawanan will net you even more information: ""Inside, there is said to be a wall, black as night. And it speaks! In the ancient Dragon tongue!"" If you heard about Volskygge from the guards, a map marker will be added; otherwise you will have to locate it yourself. The ruin lies far to the west of Solitude, past Dragon Bridge, and just south of Lost Echo Cave. Three leveled bandits guard its expansive exterior and draugr inhabit hidden, booby-trapped rooms, portending dangers to come. The ruin's large interior contains many locks and hosts myriad enemies, so carry a good supply of health potions and lockpicks or the Skeleton Key before entering. Volskygge[edit] Inside the ruin, pass through the first gate and into a throne room protected by a dart trap and two bandits patrolling back and forth. Proceed westward through a tunnel, wary of a pressure plate that triggers a spiked wall trap. Ahead stands another bandit near a locked chest that contains minor loot. The northern tunnel leads to an intersection; the path to the west from this leads to a room in which a Nord and an Orc bandit try to break into a cage (see this section). Fighting the bandits here is optional, although unlocking the cage leads to a handle that will lower a nearby wall and provide access to a secret room with minor loot. You will find a copy of the Lockpicking skill book Surfeit of Thieves on the shelves near the secret wall. From here, backtrack to the intersection and continue east into a huge dining hall littered with dead draugr through which two more bandits wander. The rooms to the north contain little of interest, so leave the area through the eastern door, but tread carefully: the dead bandit you'll see on the floor was killed by a battering ram triggered by a pressure plate just inside. Don't meet the same fate. Four Totems[edit] ""All must be activated in order, if you wish to go home."" The ruin's puzzle room is situated around the corner. A huge structure in the middle of the room points to four handles, each of which must be activated in the correct order. If you fail, undead enemies will break out of the central structure and attack. If done correctly, the torches in the middle of the room will light up as each lever is pulled in the correct order. Find the pedestal supporting the book The Four Totems of Volskygge and read it for the clues to the puzzle: The first fears all, The second fears none. The third eats what it can, Preferably number one. The fourth fears the second, But only when alone. All must be activated in order, If you wish to go home. The puzzle solution is: Snake (fears all) Bear (fears none) Fox (eats the snake) Wolf (fears the bear as an individual but not in packs) If done correctly, the adjacent iron gate will open, providing access to another room containing a spiral staircase, a chest and a secret passage. The passage is opened via a lever on the left of the two pillars on the northern wall, leading to a dart trap and a few minor items. Turn back and take the spiral staircase down, which leads to the next zone of the ruin, Volskygge Passages. Volskygge Passages[edit] The first few rooms of Volskygge Passages are empty, except for a soul gem on a pedestal and a handle that opens to a small room holding absolutely nothing (see notes). In the third chamber, a leveled draugr lurks before an altar that holds two more soul gems and a skeever tail. There is also a chest with an apprentice locked tension cable in the northeast corner of the room. After the battle, pull the handle next to the iron gate and head west, past the inactive trap door in the first chamber and a set of swinging blades triggered by a pressure plate. In the next chamber, beyond an active trap door, you will find a dead bandit near a handle which provides access to yet another secret chamber in which a potion of ultimate healing stands atop a weight sensitive plate. An adept locked chest sits in the northwest corner of the room. The trap door near the dead bandit will drop you into a tower with a broken spiral staircase and a spike pit at the bottom. A draugr patrols the passage beyond the spike pit, and the passage leads to the southeast corner of a large room. If you did not fall down the trap door, the passage heading west contains typical draugr catacombs with an urn and inactive draugr on the shelves to be looted and enters the north side of the large room. Several draugr will emerge from their shelves in this room, and there is a pressure plate on the floor which triggers a spike wall. The passage to the south contains a burial urn and an apprentice locked chest in the corner where the passage turns west. As you move forward, two more draugr will emerge. The passage will then turn north and enter a room. Two urns sit in front of the four stone pillars and impenetrable vines in the room's center. From this point, proceed with caution lest the five draugr in this room gang up on you. Up the northern stairs, a strong draugr patrols the passage. There are more urns and inactive draugr to loot in this passage along with another draugr sleeping on a shelf unless it is alerted by nearby combat. Continue north to find yet another draugr in the northern room where you will find more urns to loot and three healing potions on an altar. A pressure plate halfway up the western stairs triggers another battering ram, and another draugr waits in the passage beyond. Past this draugr, webs become more prominent, the ruins become more overgrown, and three frostbite spiders wait. A couple of web sacs contain spider eggs and dessicated corpses may yield some gold or lockpicks. Beyond a web barrier, more spiders await along with egg sacs containing more spider eggs and another web sac and dessicated corpse. Beyond the next web barrier is a room that looks even more like a natural cavern and that contains a waterfall feeding a stream. Another frostbite spider waits here, and three more will drop from the ceiling as you enter. There are also a few more dessicated corpses and another web sac containing a skeever tail.  Destroy another web barrier to enter the last part of the ruin which is less overgrown where you will find more urns and a chest with an adept locked tension cable before the passage turns south. Head south to reach a room patrolled by two more draugr. There are a few more urns here, and halfway across the room, two stone bridges cross an indoor stream.  Follow the stream to its western end to find an orichalcum ore vein, a pickaxe, and an unlocked chest. At the southern end of the room, a wide staircase leads up to a platform where another draugr patrols. The room beyond contains a few urns and a staircase heading up and east where the boss draugr awaits in a room that contains a boss chest, two more urns, a few potions on a shelf, and a coin purse, a few loose coins, and an ancient nord bow on another shelf along with 12 ancient nord arrows. The stairs heading farther up and east lead to a door that opens onto the external area Volskygge Peak. Volskygge Peak[edit] You will now stand atop the mountain where you initially entered. There is one emerald on each side of the statue at the foot of the stairs. Head up the stairs and approach the word wall for one of the words for Whirlwind Sprint. As soon as you have learned the word, Volsung, a dragon priest will burst from the sarcophagus behind you. A powerful foe, he uses only frost attacks in combat. After the battle, loot his remains for his unique dragon priest mask."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Waking_Nightmare","Learn of the nightmares of the people of Dawnstar. Follow Erandur to the Nightcaller Temple. Fight your way with Erandur to the library, and then find the book The Dreamstride. Locate and drink Vaermina's Torpor in the laboratory. In the Dreamstride, find and activate the chain that will release the Miasma. Take the soul gem to stop the force field. Make your way to the sanctum and kill Veren Duleri and Thorek. Choose whether or not to kill Erandur.","Restless Nights[edit] Upon entering Dawnstar you hear talk of the inhabitants suffering from terrible nightmares and lack of sleep. Even the Jarl himself is having trouble sleeping, and tension is high. Make your way to the Windpeak Inn, where you will find Erandur, a priest of Mara. He warns that the inhabitants of Dawnstar are in terrible danger, as the nightmares are a symptom of having their memories stolen by the Daedric Prince Vaermina. He explains that the nightmares are being caused by an event that happened in Nightcaller Temple, a ruin located on the clifftop overlooking Dawnstar. Erandur will prompt you to follow him to Nightcaller Temple to put an end to the nightmares. Temple of Doom[edit] Erandur opening the way Make your way with Erandur to the Temple, and speak to him once more outside the door. He will explain why the nightmares are occurring: Many years ago, a group of Orcish invaders attacked the temple, which was inhabited by priests of Vaermina. To defend themselves, the priests released a gas called ""The Miasma"", which the priests used to elongate their lives. The concentration of Miasma sent both the Orc invaders and the priests into a sleep that lasted for years. After speaking to him, head inside the Temple. If you have a follower, the follower will not enter. There is a working shrine of Mara on the left side wall inside the ruined temple. On the bottom shelf of the podium in the middle of the first room there is a book Lost Legends which activates the quest Forbidden Legend. Two skeevers inhabit the hall near the back, and a lectern on the raised area contains books. A novice-level chest is on the right side of the large carving on the back wall. Once the room is cleared, Erandur will unlock the carving with a spell, after which the wall will turn purple and reveal a doorway. Make your way through the opening and follow Erandur to the balcony overlooking the tower's inner sanctum. The inner sanctum contains the Skull of Corruption, one of Vaermina's artifacts. Erandur explains that the Skull has gained the ability to reach out to people without being wielded, and is stealing memories. The Skull must be destroyed in order for the nightmares to stop. Follow him down the stairs, where you will meet two Orcish invaders at the bottom. After confronting them, you will find the way ahead blocked by a force field. Erandur will say that there may be a way of opening it, but he would have to search for the answer in an alchemy book located in the locked Library upstairs. Luckily, he has a key—a memento from when he was himself a Priest of Vaermina. When the Orcs attacked, he had fled, leaving his companions to die, and in his shame over this, he turned to following Mara. Words of Power[edit] Follow Erandur back up the stairs and allow him to unlock the door to the library. The inhabitants—Orcish invaders and Vaermina Devotees—will awaken and attack. The Vaermina Devotees fight with lightning as well as conventional weapons, so a Resist Shock potion and other defenses against magic may be useful here. The library is split into two levels. The bookcases on the lower level make it quite a tight squeeze but provide useful cover from incoming spells. After all the enemies are defeated, Erandur will ask you to help find the book The Dreamstride. This contains the information needed to breach the inner sanctum. The majority of the books in the library are burnt, but a few remain intact. The Dreamstride is located on the upper level in the northeast corner of the room, on a lectern. Take it back to Erandur, who will decipher the book and state that you must use a potion called ""Vaermina's Torpor."" This allows the taker to use dreams to travel across distances in the real world. As a Priest of Mara, he is unable to use the potion, but says that you will be able to do so. Only the unaffiliated or the followers of Vaermina can use it. To find the potion, go to the laboratory, which adjoins the library. Mad Alchemist[edit] Follow Erandur to the laboratory, where you will encounter another Orcish Invader and a Vaermina Devotee. Continue down the corridor, and fight off more Vaermina Devotees and Orcish invaders. You may find it easier to back through the doorway and tackle the enemies one at a time; Erandur is quite capable of dealing with them. After they are defeated, you can look for the torpor—a tall red bottle located on the lower level in a bookcase near the northeast corner of the room. Numerous other alchemical ingredients and potions line the shelves, and on the top level near to where Erandur is waiting, there is a copy of the Alchemy skill book Mannimarco, King of Worms, on a half-buried bookshelf. Speak to Erandur, and he will command you to drink the potion. It's a good idea to save your game here. Dreamwalker[edit] Dreamwalker Upon taking the potion, you are transported to the inner sanctum in the tower, which you experience in a blurry, psychedelic vision. Two of Vaermina's Devotees are talking. Though everything is quite hazy, you can discern from what they are saying that you have traveled back in time to the moment of the Orc invasion of the temple. One of the men addresses you as ""Brother Casimir"", and asks if you are ready to release the Miasma. There is a clattering noise in the background. You cannot access your inventory while in the Dreamwalk, nor can you wait, pick up items, or fight; you will not get attacked, however. Reply that you are ready, then head down the corridor and into the dining hall. You will see battles and corpses along the way. Make a left into a bedchamber. Head up the stairs and then down the passage on the right. Navigate a winding path onward until you reach the upper level overlooking the sanctum. Locate a chain with a large ring-shaped pull and activate it. This will release the Miasma. You will then awaken. Breaking the Barrier[edit] Old friends, Veren and Thorek When your objective updates to ""Disable the Magical Barrier"", take the soul gem from just to the left of the pull chain. The forcefield will deactivate. Talk to Erandur, and he will report that you disappeared and reappeared on the other side of the barrier, and that you can now access the Skull of Corruption. Follow Erandur toward the Skull, taking care of several Orcs and Vaermina Devotees you will encounter along the way. You may confront some challenging battles here. Hanging back behind Erandur and some strategic retreats can be an effective tactic, but you will likely face the powerful battleaxes of some of the Orcs on a few occasions, or the Devotees's shock spells, both of which can deal heavy damage. Erandur will pause if he begins to get very far ahead of you. When you are nearing the Skull shrine, there is an Orc lying in a room who is especially deadly. He won't wake up spontaneously, but if you try to search him, he will come to and say ""This better be good."" He's very hard to kill and can bring you down with a single strike, according to the skill level you play at. You can awaken him even after completing the quest. You then enter the door to a new cutscene where you can only watch, and it is revealed Erandur is not who he says he is. Erandur: Wait... Veren, Thorek. You're alive. Veren: No thanks to you, Cassimir. Erandur: I no longer use that name. I'm Erandur, priest of Mara. Veren: You're a traitor. You left us to die, then ran before the miasma took you. Erandur: No, I-I was scared. I wasn't ready to sleep. Veren: Enough of your lies! I can't allow you to destroy the skull, priest of Mara. Erandur: Then you leave me no choice! Defeat them, then Erandur will begin to take down a barrier protecting the Skull. Erandur: I knew Veren and Thorek. They were my friends. Is this punishment for my past? Is it Mara's will to torment me so? We had no choice. Erandur: Yes, you're right. If they needed to die for Dawnstar to live, then it was worth the price. They were trying to kill us. Erandur: And had they succeeded, Dawnstar's fate would be sealed. You have a unique way of looking at things, my friend. Maybe they were right. Don't destroy the staff. Erandur: No! You mustn't listen to them. They speak only lies and deception. Had we aided them in releasing the skull, they would wreak havoc across Skyrim. Erandur calling upon the power of Mara Either way, he will say ""It's time. The Skull must be destroyed. If you'll stand back, I'll perform an incantation gifted to me by Lady Mara. First, an incantation will remove the barrier. I call upon you Lady Mara. The skull hungers for memories and leaves nightmares in its wake. Grant me the power to break through this barrier and send the skull to the depths of Oblivion!"" Then the barrier will suddenly disappear. Vaermina will speak to you: ""He's deceiving you. When the ritual's complete, the Skull will be free and then Erandur will turn on you. Quickly! Kill him now. Kill him and claim the Skull for your own! Vaermina commands you!"" At this point, you can kill Erandur and take the skull, or spare him and take him on as a follower. Killing him is not considered a crime. If you ignore Vaermina's command, Erandur will destroy the skull and then offer to travel with you as a follower; he does not betray you as Vaermina would have had you believe. If you choose this option, you will be one Daedric Artifact short of the 15 you need for the Oblivion Walker Achievement. Obtaining two Artifacts from one quest will then be required, and the only way you can do that is by obtaining both the Ring of Hircine and the Savior's Hide from the Daedric quest Ill Met By Moonlight. After making your choice, the quest will complete, and the nightmares will be lifted from Dawnstar."

Speak to the Greybeards at High Hrothgar.","Ivarstead[edit] After you're finished in Whiterun, you'll want to head to Ivarstead, as it is located at the foot of the 7,000 Steps leading up to High Hrothgar. Once you get there and get close to the bridge, you'll hear a conversation. Talk to one of the men, Klimmek, and learn about what dangers are lurking ahead. You can take an optional quest from him to deliver supplies to the Greybeards. You may also ask people there to tell you some information about High Hrothgar: Name  Response   Wilhelm ""The Greybeards are a solitary lot. I don't think they've ever ventured outside their monastery. We get the occasional pilgrim passing through here on their way to the summit, but almost all of them have returned disappointed.""   Klimmek ""I've been to the monastery many times, but I've never even laid eyes on one of the Greybeards. Not that I'd care to. Being masters of the Thu'um, they could kill you by uttering a single word. Well, not that they would. They seem peaceful, but I wouldn't want to provoke them. ""   Bassianus Axius ""Klimmek brings food supplies up to them once every few weeks when the weather permits it. Other than that, they seem like a quiet lot. Don't really know too much about them.""   Boti ""It's frightening living below their monastery. Sometimes I swear I can hear strange noises rolling down from up there. It sounds like thunder, but there's never any rain. What do you make of that?""   Temba Wide-Arm ""The Greybeards stay away from me, and I stay away from them. Suits me just fine.""   Gwilin ""Always thought it was odd that there's a layer of thick clouds covering the peak of the mountain above the monastery. Not sure what's up there, but I bet the Greybeards know.""   Jofthor ""They call the path to the monastery the 7,000 Steps. Can you imagine? I'm not certain if I could even make it to the top without collapsing from exhaustion.""   Fastred ""The Greybeards are a strange bunch. I heard they live their entire life without uttering a single word; can you even imagine?""   Lynly Star-Sung ""I've always fancied a journey up the 7,000 Steps to the monastery. Anything to break the boredom of living in this town. I envy you."" The 7,000 Steps[edit] When you start on the trail up, you'll run across various leveled wildlife and monsters, and a couple of pilgrims, Barknar and Karita. You will also find various etched stone tablets (""emblems"") giving you information on the history of the dragons and the Way of the Voice. There is an iron ore vein hidden near the third emblem shrine. Once the third shrine is in view climb the small hill to your right. It is at the top of the hill hidden from view of the main walking path. Shortly after the fourth emblem where you meet Karita, at a point where the steps are sandwiched between two cliffs, there is a frost troll that will jump from the top of one cliff if it sees you (though sometimes it may be found further up the path). For low-level characters, this can be a difficult fight. It can be avoided altogether by sneaking past it at night or scaling the cliffs nearby. Combat Strategies[edit] Frost trolls, like any other type of troll, have a weakness to fire. Thus, handy combat strategies include using weapons which have a fire enchantment, using fire-based destruction spells, and summoning a flame atronach. The Shout Fire Breath could also be used, as a word for it can be gained early on in the Companions questline. If you are a Dunmer, your Ancestors Wrath power will also work. Trolls can deal a substantial amount of damage, but most of it can be avoided by tactically falling back when one sees the troll raising his arms or preparing a power attack. If you need to heal, you can sprint away; the troll will not generally outrun you. Similarly, using a shield to block the Troll's attacks can also be effective, but does depend highly on timing. It is possible to scale the rocks just before the troll, allowing you to use ranged attacks to safely eliminate it. However, the troll may regenerate its health faster than you can damage it. Using a bow with a fire enchantment or ranged destruction spells such as Firebolt would give an advantage. If you are careful, it can be killed by long distance arrows from the entrance to the ravine it lives in. Go into stealth mode, stand at the entrance to the ravine, all to the right, and shoot at the troll when you can just see it on top of the cliff. If done properly, the troll may shift left or right a little, but will not come after you; the x2 sneak attack bonus (x3 with the perk) should allow you to kill it quickly. However, if it falls off the cliff, this will not work anymore. You can lure the troll up to High Hrothgar, and the Whirlwind Sprint shout will briefly help you move faster. If the troll follows you into the monastery, the Greybeards will defeat it very quickly. If you retreat down the stairs, Karita, who is meditating at the tablet, will help defeat the troll. Avoiding the Fight[edit] It is easily possible to simply run past the Troll, as it moves rather slowly. Nords can use their racial power Battle Cry to make the troll flee for 30 seconds, giving you enough time to run to High Hrothgar. Similarly, a Bosmer can use Command Animal to calm the troll. You can also use Animal Allegiance to calm the troll. You can use Unrelenting Force at the troll, then sprint away before the stun effect wears off. You can scale the rocks to the left of the ravine, and you'll never be detected at all. The Greybeards[edit] High Hrothgar After finally arriving at High Hrothgar, you'll be greeted by Master Arngeir, who speaks to you on behalf of the other Greybeards (whose voices are too powerful for conversation). After proving you are the Dragonborn by using the Unrelenting Force shout, they welcome you to their monastery and instruct you on how to use the dragon shouts, or Thu'um. To further your training in the ways of the Thu'um, you will be taught the second word to the Unrelenting Force shout, Ro, and asked to practice it three times on ethereal targets that the Greybeards summon. Arngeir comments on how quickly you learn, then takes you outside for the next lesson. They teach you another word for Whirlwind Sprint. You'll be asked to practice it by using the shout to get through the gate Master Borri opens before it closes. When you're finished, Arngeir will send you on the last test: retrieving the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. Achievements[edit] One achievement is unlocked when you complete this quest: The Way of the Voice (20 points/Bronze)"

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Whispering_Door","Talk to the innkeeper of The Bannered Mare in Whiterun. Ask Jarl Balgruuf the Greater about his children. Talk to Nelkir. Investigate the old wooden door in the basement. Talk to Nelkir again. Acquire the key from Balgruuf the Greater or Farengar Secret-Fire. Open the door. Retrieve the Ebony Blade.","A Disturbed Youth[edit] Speaking with the publican at The Bannered Mare about rumors can have them reveal to you that there is trouble in the Jarl's family. Been hearing some strange tales of the Jarl's children. Say the one's turning wicked, and the others have an ill-favored look to them. Best to keep clear."" You can ask the Jarl himself, Balgruuf the Greater, about it. Initially, he is situated within Dragonsreach, but if the player sided with the Stormcloaks in the Civil War, he will be in the Blue Palace basement. He will eventually express concerns that his youngest son, Nelkir, has become exceptionally brooding: ""Yes, my youngest son. He's a dark child. I don't know what to do with him. He was always a quiet lad, but lately... something has changed. He's become brooding. Violent. He won't say a word to me, but I don't know how I upset him. If you could speak to him. Draw out the truth. I would be immensely grateful."" Nelkir (who is always in Dragonsreach, regardless of where his father is), will be surprisingly forthcoming if you speak to him. Your father said to speak to you. ""So the disgusting pig sent you to bother me? One day, I'll tear his face apart so he can leave me alone. My father doesn't know anything about me. But I know about him. And about the war. More than he might think."" What sorts of things? ""I know that he still worships Talos. That he hates the Thalmor almost as much as the Stormcloaks do. That he worries about being chased from Whiterun. That he... that I'm...  that I don't have the same mother as my brother and sister."" How do you know these things? ""This castle is old. Lots of places nobody's been in a long while. Places where you can overhear things. See things. And the Whispering Lady."" Who's the Whispering Lady? ""She won't tell me her name. I've gotten good at listening to keyholes. At the door in the basement, I hear her talking to me. I thought I was caught, but she started telling me even more secrets. But I can't open the door."" Where is this door? ""In the basement. Trust me, you'll see it. I bet she'll talk to you, too."" The Whispering Lady[edit] The Ebony Blade The door is actually well hidden in plain sight off the main hall of Dragonsreach. In order to find it, go into the kitchen. Proceed down the stairs and open the closet door in the small servant's room. At the back of the closet is a locked door which seems to be covered in blood. Activate the door, and the disembodied voice of the Whispering Lady will begin talking to you. (Listen at the door) ""At last. I've been waiting for someone more fit to carry out my will. The child is spirited, but lacks... agency.  Is there someone behind the door? ""Regrettably, I cannot reach your plane so directly. But I forgive you for not knowing who I am. Few hear my whispers anymore. I am Mephala, the Lady of Whispers. I tug at the web of connections between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal. The boy was good at sussing out secrets. You, I expect to take a more active role."" What could the boy not do? ""The boy is good at sussing out secrets, but the corruptibility of children is ultimately too limited for my purposes. You, though, I expect will prove far more malleable."" If you had asked her the latter question, there will be another stage of dialogue before the dialogue paths merge together again. Who are you to expect anything? ""I forgive your not knowing my name. Few can hear my whispers anymore. I am Mephala, the Lady of Whispers. I tug at the web of connections between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal."" I'm not so easily molded. ""You may think so. But in the end, you mortals will always flit like fire with the winds of your desires and conveniences. And those winds issue from my whispers."" At this point you will either confirm you are willing to help, or refuse to. What do you want me to do? ""First, you must open this door. A piece of my power has been locked away behind it, and even my eyes cannot see past the seals. I'd much rather it be in the hands of an ambitious and talented person such as yourself."" I don't want to help you. ""Suit yourself. But those who listen at doors always wonder what is beyond them. Eventually your curiosity will drive you back to me."" Regardless of your previous choice, you will now only have one option if you continue to speak to the door. How do I open the door? ""The whole of Whiterun is ripe [sic] with paranoia and tensions. The Jarl's court is right to fear the power I hold behind this door. The Jarl trusts few, and they will be his undoing. The dark child knows of what I speak. Let him guide your path."" Return to Nelkir to learn how you can go about getting the key to the door. Do you know how to open the Whispering Door? ""I told you, I know everything about this castle. For some reason that door is special. Only two people can open it, Balgruuf and Farengar, the court wizard. How you get it from them is up to you. Nobody would notice if Farengar went missing, I promise you."" Opening the Door[edit] Nelkir will tell you that only the Jarl and the court mage, Farengar Secret-Fire, possess a key to the Whispering Door, and suggests that Farengar will not be missed should he disappear. You can either track down the Jarl, who is either in his quarters or in the Blue Palace, or his wizard. Farengar will always be situated in Dragonsreach, even if the Jarl is now a prisoner of the Civil War. As for the key itself, you can pickpocket the Whispering Door key off either Farengar or Balgruuf, or you can follow Nelkir's advice to kill Farengar and take it from his corpse. When you have the key, head down to the basement and open the door, which reveals a small room with a sword and a book resting on a table. The book, Admonition Against Ebony, warns you against taking the sword lying next to it; however, to complete the quest, simply ignore the warning and pick up the sword. Mephala will speak to you again. ""Excellent work. Now, I trust you're sharp enough to see that the sword doesn't match the description of the Ebony Blade you may know. It has languished too long outside the winds of alliance and betrayal. To return to its past glory, it must first drink the blood of deceit. To return to its past glory, it must reacquaint itself with the hatred of this world. Your world is admirably steeped in lies and inclinations. My blade is a darling leech that feeds on deceptions, and nourishes its master. Seek out those closest to you. The final pluck of their misguided heartstrings will accompany my blade in the song of your grandeur. The blade will feed on the ire of Tamriel. Bathe in your infamy. Feel the weight of their loathing, and my power will course through it once more."" If you choose to restore the blade, it requires staining with the blood of treachery. However, the blade's restoration is not necessary to complete the quest, simply its retrieval. Also, while you do not receive any further information on Nelkir's condition, if there are any subsequent interactions there seems to be an improvement in disposition. If you do choose to use the blade as Mephala has instructed, she will speak to you again each time you kill a friend. ""Excellent work, child."" ""I can feel their heartbreak swelling in my blade."" ""Their tears shine the ebony to a sharpest gleam."" ""Ah, the blood of deceit is a nourishing flow."" After you perform the final needed kill, Mephala will speak to you a final time to congratulate you. ""At last, my blade is returned to its full glory. Now go forth, child. Continue your tiny subversions against the orders of trust and intimacy."""
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Whispers_in_the_Dark","Hide in the Night Mother's coffin and listen to Cicero. Step out and confront Cicero and Astrid. Take contracts from Nazir.","Secret Agent[edit] After returning from your assassination mission in Mourning Never Comes, Astrid will confide that she needs help with a matter of a somewhat more personal nature. She confesses that she is a little concerned about the Night Mother's Keeper, Cicero. The strange and erratic jester has been locking himself in the chamber with the Night Mother's coffin and frantically whispering to someone. Astrid fears a conspiracy and asks you to spy on Cicero to see what he is up to. However, in order to effectively eavesdrop and not be detected she asks you to hide in the coffin with the Night Mother's corpse. You can state your objections or remain silent at this strange directive, but in either case, make your way to the chamber to make yourself cozy with the Night Mother. The Night Mother speaks You can talk to the other Dark Brotherhood members about Astrid's conspiracy theory. You can tell them: ""Astrid thinks a Family member may be conspiring with Cicero."" They all answer differently: Arnbjorn: ""She said that? If I find anyone working against my wife, or this Sanctuary, I'll beat them to death with their own severed head. Of course, they'd probably already be dead... But you know what I mean!"" Babette: ""Oh! Well, I hope she doesn't suspect me. I mean, I've spoken with Cicero a bit, and he's quite charming. But I'd never go against Astrid. Never."" Festus Krex: ""	Ha! And would that surprise anyone? This Sanctuary's a mess. Wouldn't surprise me if somebody's talking to the fool on the sly. Making deals. And no, before you ask, it's not me. I know which side my bread is buttered on."" Gabriella: ""To what end? Usurping Astrid's authority as leader of the Sanctuary? Hmmm... Yes, I can see her concern. Thank you for bringing this to my attention."" Nazir: ""Does she? Listen, brother/sister... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid."" Veezara: ""You're joking. While I can understand if some family members wish to honor the Old Ways once more, surely no one would oppose Astrid's rule."" There is no option for asking Cicero, as this would ruin Astrid's plan. Listen to Your Mother[edit] You will need to pick the novice lock on the Night Mother's coffin, then step inside. The scene fades to black and you will soon hear Cicero begin to address someone. He pleads for his companion to speak, and complains that he must do all the work, but is ever obedient. Suddenly, you will see the Night Mother in the coffin with you; she begins to speak and you realize that she pities Cicero. He has been attempting to communicate with the Night Mother all along, however the Night Mother refuses to speak to Cicero because he is not the Listener. Outside the coffin, Cicero despairs of the Night Mother actually speaking to anyone, and at his failure at finding a Listener. Again, the Night Mother addresses you. She names you Listener and tasks you with traveling to Volunruud and speaking with Amaund Motierre. She instructs you to tell Cicero a covert phrase: ""Darkness rises when silence dies"". Darkness Rises When Silence Dies[edit] The coffin opens and as you step out, a horrified Cicero demands an explanation. Tell him you are ""the one"", but he refuses to believe you. Tell him the signal phrase the Night Mother gave you and Cicero becomes ecstatic and dances a little jig. Astrid will burst into the room, alerted by the commotion. She comes to realize that there is no treachery or traitor, but is a little put-off by your assertion that you are now the Listener. When you explain what the Night Mother has asked of you, Astrid becomes defensive claiming, ""I'm still the leader in this family"". Astrid needs time to process all of this and sends you to take a contract from Nazir, rather than allowing you to go to Volunruud, while she thinks about this turn of events. If you have already completed the first three contracts Nazir gave you then he will give you two new contracts, Kill Hern and Kill Lurbuk. If you have not completed the initial contracts, then Nazir will complain that you still have contracts to complete and urge you to get on with them. In either case, this quest will complete upon speaking with Nazir."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_White_Phial_(quest)","Talk to Nurelion in his Windhelm store. Retrieve the White Phial from Forsaken Cave. Return the Phial to Nurelion. Talk to his assistant, Quintus Navale, for your final reward.","His Last Hope[edit] The only Alchemy shop in Windhelm is called The White Phial and is located in the market district, right next to Aval Atheron's stall. When you enter you will witness a very sick and elderly proprietor, Nurelion, trying to convince his assistant that he is able to make some kind of journey. The assistant, Quintus Navale, is quite skeptical and with good reasons, as his master coughs constantly in between words: ""Master, you're far too old for this sort of journey."" Nurelion: ""I'll be fine."" Quintus: ""Master, you're far too old for this sort of journey. We don't know what's inside..."" Nurelion: ""I'll... I can... just..."" Quintus: ""You see, you're not well! Have a seat and I'll fetch you some tonic."" Nurelion: ""Bah. If there was a tonic that could help me, I would have found it by now..."" After the discussion, Nurelion will take his place behind the counter and Quintus will walk away. Ask Nurelion what the argument was about and he will explain: ""Just a man's life work, is all. I've finally derived the location of the White Phial, but this doting busybody won't let me get it."" He is obviously referring to Quintus, but offer to help him find whatever he is looking for and he will provide some background information: ""It's buried with its maker, Curalmil, in a long forsaken cave to the west of here. Curalmil was a crafty one, even in death. You would need the skills of a master alchemist to reach his resting place. Luckily for you, I've already made the mixture."" He will then hand you his mixture and add a marker to your map. He will then explain that the White Phial is a legendary bottle, forged in the days when Skyrim was just starting its turn to ice. He then tells you he spent his entire life searching for it, in libraries and small villages, researching its location, and will explain the name of his store: ""I even named my shop after it, hoping that it might attract anyone who had heard of it. And now it's within my grasp... but the Eight, it seems, have chosen me for their amusement.... for in my current condition, I'll never be able to lay my hands on it."" The Forsaken[edit] Forsaken Cave The map marker leads to Forsaken Cave, a cave west of Windhelm, straight south of Alftand. Enter the premises and head down the icy slope to the east. Kill the leveled wolves, frost trolls, or snow bears as you go along and open the door to the west, leading to a cave inhabited by draugr enemies. A tempting chest will be visible in a tunnel as you go along, but beware of the pressure plate triggering a dart trap above the chest. After a while, the surroundings will change into catacombs and more draugr will be revived and attack. Fight your way through the many tunnels and keep an eye out for a copy of the quest-related skill book The Mirror near a locked door leading to a chest with minor loot. The large northwestern room has three flame sprout traps and a hidden chest just before the next tunnel. Beware of yet another pressure plate triggering a battering ram and pick up some useful potions and ingots from the shelves before entering Forsaken Crypt. You enter the crypt to the sight of a large room in two levels, with an overhanging bridge above. A draugr will be patrolling a path next to another still resting just around the corner. A ranged attack can dispose of it without disturbing the other. On the second floor another draugr will be found in its sarcophagus just to the right of the bridge. Locate the narrow tunnel to the northeast and make your way upstairs. After dispatching a patrolling draugr, a pair of Ancient Nordic Boots and a hide helmet can be found on a table at the end of a passage. Around the next corner, four burial urns can be found cemented into the ground. Two more urns can be found on the ground to the right of the opening just before you reach the bridge which overlooks the room you passed through before entering the tunnel. As you cross the bridge dispatch the leveled draugr which will emerge from its sarcophagus on the right end of the platform, then claim the contents of the chest and shelves on the other side. Turn right and cross another bridge into the next room, where you will encounter two draugr and a huge ceiling spike trap located in the center. An expert-locked door will be located on the western wall leading to an unlocked chest with some minor loot. The room features two burial urns on the northern wall, and a portcullis leading to a caved in tunnel. Carefully make your way around the spike trap and pass through the iron door on the other side. Cross the gated bridge which overlooks the two lower levels you passed previously. A patrolling draugr can be sniped with a ranged weapon as it passes the corner at the end of the tunnel. Another sleeping draugr will be standing just round the corner to the right of the fire pit as you enter the room. The same situation will occur with the next corner. A final draugr wight will be sleeping in a standing position to the left hand side of the iron doorway, which opens into a swinging blades trap on the other side. As you pass through the blades, the draugr boss Curalmil will burst out of his sarcophagus and attack, along with several leveled draugr enemies. Dispose of them all and find the word wall for a word related to the Marked for Death shout and a boss-leveled chest. Find the tunnel leading west behind the sarcophagus and place Nurelion's mixture in the ancient bowl at the end. This lowers the stone wall in front of you and you will have free access to the final chamber which contains a variety of different alchemy ingredients, the alchemy skill book A Game at Dinner, and the Cracked White Phial. Go back to the chamber with the word wall and turn right, where you will find an open set of iron doors leading to a staircase which will return you to Forsaken Cave. As you enter the next room, activate the lever which will open the cavern wall and continue forward until you reach the tunnel leading back to Skyrim. The Crack in the Plan[edit] Time is running out... Back in The White Phial, Nurelion's poor health has taken yet another turn for the worse, forcing the old proprietor to sit in a chair around the clock with Quintus Navale in charge of the merchant services. Enter the private quarters upstairs and show Nurelion the cracked Phial. Understandably, this will make him quite upset: ""This... it matches every description of the Phial that I've found in lore. But if it can't hold liquid, there's no way of knowing. How did you manage to damage it, then? This is what I get for not retrieving it myself."" When you tell him that it was broken to begin with, he will become disparaging: ""Figures—I doubt you have sufficient knowledge to harm the Phial even if you wanted to. Either way, this is the end of it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm not quite in the mood to entertain guests. I trust you can show yourself out. Here's for your trouble."" He then hands you a rather lousy reward of five gold, and then goes directly to bed, where he will stay 24 hours a day, obviously dying from his terminal illness. Attempting to speak to him after that will cause a ""Nurelion is asleep and dying."" message to appear on the screen, with an ""OK"" option directly below it. Leave him and head downstairs where Quintus will be eager to talk to you: ""I want to thank you for your help. I know my master can be a bit short at times."" He will then make up for his master's cheapness and hand you an additional five hundred gold, then go to watch over his master upstairs. However, there's still hope. A few days later, you will receive a letter from Quintus, starting the quest Repairing the Phial. If, however, The Throat of the World is not yet completed before this quest, you'll first have to finish that one before you can start Repairing the Phial."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:With_Friends_Like_These...","(Optional) Receive a mysterious note from a courier. Go to sleep. Kill a captive or the Dark Brotherhood's leader. Choose to join or destroy the Dark Brotherhood.","A Mysterious Note and a Good Night's Sleep[edit] The Mysterious Note Some time after Aventus Aretino rewards you for killing Grelod the Kind and you've left Windhelm, a courier will approach you and deliver a Mysterious Note bearing the ominous words ""We know."" The next time you sleep for any duration, you will ""awake after a full sleep"" to find that you have been mysteriously transported to unfamiliar surroundings. The quest can also sometimes be started after completing Aventus's quest by sleeping in any bed, even before receiving the Mysterious Note from the courier. Astrid's Test[edit] You will awaken in an abandoned shack to a greeting from Astrid. She will calmly inform you that your killing of Grelod the Kind has pleased the Dark Brotherhood, but that, in doing so, you stole a contract belonging to the Night Mother, the Brotherhood's disembodied spiritual leader. Thus, you must repay your debt: ""A life for a life"", as Astrid explains. She will tell you that you cannot leave the room until someone dies. The unpickable door to exit the shack is locked, and Astrid has the key. You have the option of fulfilling the Night Mother's demand for a life by killing Astrid. Doing this will cause you to fail this quest and immediately start the Destroy the Dark Brotherhood! quest. If you don't wish to kill Astrid, the room is also occupied by three bound captives. Astrid will inform you that ""One of these poor sods has a contract out on their life. Which one is it?"" It is up to you to figure out which and then carry out the job. You can refuse to carry out the job, but you can't avoid killing somebody. When facing them, the captive to the left-hand side is Fultheim the Fearless, a mercenary. He claims to be unaware of anyone in particular who would want him dead, but reasons that, being a sell-sword, any number of people could hold a grudge against him. When intimidated, he also admits, ""Maybe there were... times I got carried away? But war is war."" The captive in the center is Alea Quintus, a crass and abrasive mother of six who constantly and irritatingly demands to be released. She indicates that the tough attitude she has adopted to manage so many children might motivate someone to wish her dead. ""Do some people look down on me? Have I made some enemies? You're damn right."" The final captive, to the right-hand side, is a Khajiit named Vasha, who casually incriminates himself as an ""obtainer of goods, taker of lives, and defiler of daughters."" He is the only one of the three who remains calm in the face of imminent death, and mentions that this isn't the first time he's been ""bagged and dragged."" He also states that ""If one of my enemies wouldn't pay to have me killed, I'd take it as a personal insult."" In truth, it doesn't matter which captive(s) you choose. You won't encounter any of them again (unless you return to the shack, and even then you won't be able to learn more). If you kill one or more of them, Astrid will give you the password to the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary's ""The Black Door"". You will then be given a key to let yourself out of the shack. Victim(s) Astrid's comments   Alea ""Ah, the feisty goodwife. Quite the mouth on her. Someone must have wanted her dead... right?""   Fultheim '""Oh ho. The whimpering Nord, eh? Yes, yes, I can see how you'd come to that conclusion. Interesting choice.""   Vasha ""The conniving Khajiit. Cat like that was sure to have enemies. It's no wonder you chose him.""   Alea and Fultheim ""The blubbering barbarian and the tenacious mother. Must have been one of them, right?""   Alea and Vasha ""Hmm. The fearless wife and mother, and the underhanded Khajiit. Had to be one of them, right? Interesting choice.""   Fultheim and Vasha ""The timid warrior and the sly Khajiit. Must have been one or the other, right?""   Alea, Fultheim, and Vasha ""Well, well, aren't we the over-achiever? Three possibilities, three victims. Must have been one of them, right? So why take chances...""   Astrid ""Well done..."" Enter the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary[edit] The Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary is located almost due south of the Abandoned Shack, near the southern border of the province of Skyrim and just west of Falkreath. Upon entering the Sanctuary, the optional Delayed Burial quest will fail if you started it, or be unavailable if you have not started it. If you want to do this minor quest, detour to the quest location, north of Whiterun, on the way to the sanctuary. When you activate the Sanctuary's entrance, The Black Door, it will ask, ""What is the music of life?"" Answer with the password Astrid taught you: ""Silence, my brother"". You will be welcomed to your new ""home"" and the door will open. Speak Again with Astrid[edit] Find Astrid inside. She will welcome you to the family by giving you several pieces of Shrouded Armor apparel, which provide enhancements useful to assassins. (There are also several other Shrouded Armor pieces on a shelf to the right of the room.) You are a now a full member of the Dark Brotherhood, and enjoy all the advantages associated therewith. Astrid will reveal that she is currently arranging an important job to give you, and that you should, in the meantime, take care of some routine assassination contracts handled by Nazir. She will encourage you to introduce yourself to your new family members and give a rundown on how the Brotherhood operates. She gives a brief history on the Brotherhood and also informs you that they have done away with all rules and policies except for one simple principle, ""Respect the Family"". You may also learn that the corpse of the Night Mother is en route to the Sanctuary, though she does not know when it might arrive.

The letter warns you of an impending threat and requests that you return to Solitude. When you get there, Falk will inform you that Potema has indeed escaped. He asks you to speak with Styrr, a priest of Arkay, as he can provide you with more guidance on how to secure the threat. The Wolf Queen and You[edit] Styrr is located in Solitude's Hall of the Dead. You should probably ask him exactly what you are getting yourself into with Potema. Potema is the granddaughter of Uriel Septim II, and former Queen of Solitude, and was quite intent on becoming Empress. A formidable necromancer, she had raised armies of dead led by vampires to help her. Since she had not achieved her corporeal form during the summoning, she has fled to a place of the dead, her Catacombs. Because you were present at Potema's summoning, there is now a strange connection between the two of you, and it must be you that deals with her. To keep Potema from returning fully, you must find her remains and bring them to Styrr to be sanctified. To assist you, Styrr gives you the key to the catacombs, and the spell Turn Undead. The Wolf's Den[edit] ""You've arrived at last."" The entrance to the catacombs is in the Temple of the Divines. When you arrive in the temple, go to the back, past the pews, and on your left will be some stairs going down. Take the stairs, and you will be confronted with a locked iron gate, which can only be unlocked using the key Styrr gave you. Through here you will see the hole one of Potema's servants created into Potema's Catacombs. The dungeon is filled with Potema's minions: leveled draugr and vampires. The dungeon itself is very linear, and proceeding through it is a fairly simple endeavor. Upon entering, the voice of Potema calls to you: ""You've arrived at last. The hero/heroine who prevented me from being bound returns to my fold. I have much to thank you for, little one. When you die I will raise you and you can take your place by my side."" The iron gate that previously barred your path is opened once Potema finishes speaking. Proceed forward until you reach a room at the bottom of a set of stairs with purple flammable liquid on the floor. There is a table in the center of this room, with a copy of the Lockpicking skill book Surfeit of Thieves. A draugr rising from the water. You will eventually reach what seems like a dead end, but there is a lever to open the path forward. Activate the lever, and the stone wall in front of you will start to revolve. Waiting will reveal that there is a door opening barred by an iron bar gate cut out in the rotating wall. If you throw the lever at just the right moment, you can stop the revolving wheel as the gate is opening. Potema's Refuge[edit] Walking forward will bring you to a room with three additional revolving-stone doorways and three corresponding levers. Activating the first lever in line will stop and start the first revolving door, etc. Stop all three doors when the entrance is open to you, and walk forward. These rotating doors may slip over time so it's a one way trip past this point (or you can keep them spinning and run through carefully). You will come to a room with a ""sleeping"" draugr in a throne near the back of the room and an accompanying vampire. The vampire will approach you and speak before attacking: ""You've come far, mortal. No doubt you seek to enter Potema's Sanctum. I can see to that. We'll need plenty of fresh corpses to rebuild her army, you see."" The draugr will now rise from the throne. The key to Potema's Sanctum is found on the body of the vampire (another copy of the key is found on the armrest of the draugr's throne). Loot it to avoid picking the master lock to Potema's Sanctum, which is the final area of the dungeon. ""No doubt you seek to enter Potema's Sanctum."" Potema's Sanctum[edit] ""Serve me in death."" Proceeding forward will bring you to a room full of dead draugr, a dead vampire and a locked iron gate. Potema's voice will speak out to you: ""Not much further. Come, little thing. Serve me in death."" The iron gate will then unlock, and Potema will reanimate the vampire and two of the draugr in the room. Defeat them, then continue. In the hallway before the final encounter, there are two resist shock potions on the shelf near the door. Take them; you will need them to protect yourself against Potema. You will eventually come to a room with a floating spirit and tombs scattered around the perimeter and center of the room. This is the boss fight.  Defeating Potema[edit] ""You've come far, mortal, but can you stand against my inner council? Let's see!"" Again, you will hear Potema's voice: ""You've come far, mortal, but can you stand against my inner council? Let's see!"" She will radiate bolts of electricity and rotate the bolts, dealing shock damage to those the bolts of electricity hit. It is advisable to consume potions which give you Resist Shock - such as those in the antechamber. During the fight, she will mock you, ""Don't applaud yourself too soon, worm!"" and spur on her minions, ""Rip the eyes from his/her head!"". Arrows will not affect Potema, but magic will. Potema will also release draugr from their tombs to attack you. Some of the draugr are warlocks and can summon frost atronachs to join the fight. After each wave of defeated draugr, Potema will reanimate some of them, and will release more draugr, as well. Each wave of draugr you defeat will make Potema weaker. Keep killing the draugr, and the spirit of Potema will eventually recede into the locked room opposite where you came in. Follow the spirit of Potema, and Potema's Ghostly Remains will appear, ready to fight you. The apparition respawns and has to be defeated several times. It can also resurrect the draugr you just killed in the last room so watch for attacks from behind. After defeating the apparition, you will see that there is a seat with a skull on it. This skull is Potema's Remains. Take Potema's Skull, and loot the chest. Inside the chest is the Sneak skill book Legend of Krately House. Exit the room. Potema's Remains at her throne. The Unholy Remains[edit] There are only two more enemies between you and the exit at this point, two draugr, one higher level than the other. They are found seated in facing alcoves with a short pillar in the middle of the hall between them. On the pillar is a helmet or some other piece of loot. If you take this bait, the draugr awaken and attack you. You can ignore them and walk past (the object on the pillar is usually low-level), or deal with them individually. A short distance after this, you pass through a door and emerge on a mountain overlooking a docked ship in Solitude. There is an unlocked chest with random loot to your immediate left as you emerge onto the mountain ledge and a random potion to the right of the chest and a random helmet on the rock above. Travel to Solitude and go to the Hall of the Dead. There, speak with Styrr and he will gratefully accept the remains. He goes off to bless the remains, and all there is left to do now is to report to Falk Firebeard. Returning the remains will count as assisting the people of Haafingar.  The Shield of Solitude[edit] Travel to the Blue Palace and speak to Falk, where he will speak on behalf of the jarl in expressing his gratitude. Your reward is gold and the Shield of Solitude. The quest concludes here. After the release of the Anniversary Edition and with the Bone Wolf Creation installed, you will receive another letter by courier once this quest has been completed. Reading this letter will trigger the next quest, Let Sleeping Wolves Lie."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Words_of_Power","","After completing The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, you can talk to Arngeir and tell him that you would like to learn more about the Voice.  He will respond: ""You have learned so much already, Dragonborn. Growing your gift too quickly would be dangerous. But there are many Words of Power in Skyrim, carved in the Dragon tongue. Even from here, we can feel the Thu'um resonate from them.  Finding these lost Words would be a sufficient test, to temper your abilities with experience. Ask when you are ready to search."" Thereafter, you can ask him whether the Greybeards have located any words of power.  He has two possible replies: ""There is only silence right now. Perhaps later we will hear one of the lost Words."" ""We have felt the whisper of a Word. Give me your map, and I will show you where its echo can be found."" The latter response will cause the location of the word wall to be marked on your map, and you will be given a new quest objective. This quest can be repeated multiple times, and it can also be active simultaneously with the other word wall quest, Shout - learn about word wall. Both quests can even point you to the same location as the other. However, if you choose to kill Paarthurnax for the Blades, this quest is no longer available."

"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_World-Eater%27s_Eyrie","Set Odahviing free. Talk to Odahviing. Reach Alduin's portal to Sovngarde. Enter Sovngarde.","Preparation[edit] You cannot take any followers with you on the final two quests, so not only can they not fight alongside you, they cannot carry your burdens. Also, you can never come back here, so you need to take anything you want (particularly the unique items) in your one visit, making carrying space a concern. You will likely be of a high level when completing this quest, resulting in the loot being of higher quality, but better quality is penalized with higher weights. Only take the bare essentials, strip yourself of anything you don't normally use, though bear in mind you will face some tough fights, so if you rely on food or potions to heal you will need to bring enough. One set of armor, one melee weapon setup (one hand and shield, dual wield, or two handed), and one ranged weapon, should be all you carry. The Dremora ButlerDB, Dremora merchantDB, the Steed Stone power, and the Extra Pockets perk from the Pickpocket skill can all help to provide some relief. Also consider using the Twin Souls perk from Conjuration to at least have twice as many summoned entities. The Spectral Assassin spell will work well, and Rieklings might randomly join you to combat enemies; both can respectively be unlocked from 'Bound Until Death' and 'The Chief of Thirsk Hall'. Set Odahviing Free[edit] In order to free Odahviing, talk to the Whiterun guard standing on the second floor (there is a stone staircase near where the jarl is standing). After a short discussion, the guard will release Odahviing for you. You can also pull the chain to release the dragon yourself without talking to the guard, which is useful if the guard is incapacitated or there is a bounty on your head. Tell Odahviing you're ready to travel and he will fly you directly to Skuldafn. Upon Arrival[edit] Skuldafn overview Upon arriving at the Skuldafn courtyard, you'll encounter two dragons and multiple draugr. Battle or sneak your way past them to enter the temple complex. The two Towers (North and South) have only minor loot and won't get you any closer to the Temple itself.  If you have a high enough sneak skill, it is possible to sneak past all enemies, including the dragons. It is also possible, though tedious, to scale the mountain beside you as high as you can go, and jump along the mountainside until you reach the temple. At this point you can drop down and sneak through the snowberries at the base of the mountain. Skuldafn Temple[edit] After entering the Temple area, you come to a large chamber with draugr. Be careful of the dart trap in the western pathway. Continuing leads you to the first puzzle in Skuldafn, which is used to open two doorways. The puzzle consists of three pillars, each separated by a wall, and a switch between the pillars and the doorways. Each pillar has three pictographs: Eagle, Snake, and Whale. On the walls beside the two outside pillars are matching pictographs for those pillars. The west pillar is a Whale and the east is a Snake. Set the outer pillars so that the pictographs face each other (e.g., Snake faces Snake). Above each doorway are more pictographs. Above the east doorway is an Eagle. This way just leads to a treasure chest and a collapsed wall. Above the west doorway is a snake, which leads to the destination. Face the pictograph on the central pillar that matches the desired door to face north, toward the doors. Pull the lever to open door (with your back to the lever, you should see Eagle, Eagle, Eagle to open and close the dead-end door. With your back to the lever, you should see Eagle, Snake, Eagle to open and close the progressing door. You must close one door before you can open the other). The next small room is full of draugr, and the following one has multiple frostbite spiders who made good use of their webbing to block a door and cover a chest. The second puzzle room is solved by Whale—Snake—Eagle (upper level left, middle lower level, upper level right), with the solutions for the first and third shown above them and the second behind the platform. A chest can also be found behind the platform. Whirlwind Sprint can be used from the platform to bypass the puzzle. Enter the door to go to another section of Skuldafn Temple. Take out the draugr and keep moving (there isn't much loot around). Cross the bridge (from its eastern entry to the west, seen from entrance) but be careful of the pressure plate trap at the doorway to the next room. Activating it releases a lantern that lights up the oil slick ahead and also triggers a dart trap. Go up the staircase to meet three draugr, which can be dispatched easily with another oil slick and lantern. Pull the lever near the oil (in a small window) to open the gate on the other side of the room. Don't forget the chest (by the other window). Follow the wide tunnel, grabbing the contents of the chest on the right side. Be careful when you reach the large oil slick, as there is another lantern poised over it that will drop if you step on the pressure plate in front. It is a useful way to dispose of upcoming high-level draugr; by running away and leading him into it. You will then arrive at a puzzle door guarded by a leveled draugr or dragon priest carrying the diamond claw needed to open it. The combination to the door is, from top to bottom, Fox—Moth—Dragon; this can be seen by examining the claw in your inventory. The next two rooms (the first large, the next small) are basically empty except for a word wall, which teaches you a word for the Storm Call shout. Also, just before the door to exit is a room to the right. There are some hidden gems in a pot on a shelf to the right: a flawless emerald, a ruby, and a diamond hidden by a linen wrap. Dragon Priest[edit] Nahkriin guards the portal at Skuldafn, flanked by two dragons You will end up on a large rocky platform, above where you first entered Skuldafn. Defeat the draugr who are there to meet you, (Hint: Unrelenting Force will be useful here) and take the wooden platform ahead of you (from where you exited the Temple) to go down a small tower that has some good loot on shelves and a large chest at the bottom. Returning to the top, you may notice two dragons above you, perched on columns. This is where you need to be to finish the quest. But before you can enter Alduin's portal to Sovngarde, you must get past a dragon priest named Nahkriin. This dragon priest can be tough if you don't take the fight to him. Additionally, if you engage the two nearby dragons at the same time, the fight can be much more difficult. However, the two dragons may not move from their perches or become hostile. When you reach the top of the stairs Nahkriin will notice you and make his way toward his staff. It's best to start your assault immediately. He doesn't attack until he gets his staff, so get to him quickly. After Nahkriin grabs his staff, he'll turn around to face you. Be careful with this one as his staff does 50 shock damage per second. Any shock resistance potions or enchanted apparel you have would be useful now. He doesn't start off with full health, so if you jumped on attacking him before he grabbed his staff you should be able to dispatch him in short time. He can also be pushed off the ledge, and will fall to his death. After defeating Nahkriin, pick up his staff and mask and activate the Dragon Seal. Alternatively, you can bypass the fight by getting to the portal before Nahkriin can remove his staff. This can be achieved with the Slow Time shout, although you won't be able to collect his mask, which will make it impossible to complete the untracked quest to collect all the dragon priest masks."
"https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Yngol%27s_Barrow","Note: This quest does not appear in your journal (see this section for details). Obtain a Coral Dragon Claw. Solve the Barrow's puzzle. Escape the Barrow.","Birna's Odd Investment[edit] When you arrive in snowy Winterhold for the first time, you may witness local merchant Birna and her brother Ranmir shout at each other in the middle of the street: ""We need coin, Ranmir, and you're not bringing home any."" Birna: ""We need coin, Ranmir, and you're not bringing home any."" Ranmir: ""And you'd have me do what, join the College and prance about casting spells all day?"" Birna: ""Don't just walk away from me! Where do you think you're going?"" Ranmir: ""To the Inn for a drink, of course! Where else could I even go in this gods-forsaken town?"" Birna: ""And what, you think that'll solve all your problems?"" Ranmir: ""Probably not, but it's worth a try!"" Obviously, Birna needs some profits, and during conversation she will mention a bad deal she made recently: ""Yeah, it was stupid of me. I shouldn't have believed the story and just refused the trade. But I didn't, and now I'm stuck with this worthless junk."" She will then tell the tale: ""Some line about this claw thing and Yngol Barrow. He said it was worth more than its weight in gold if I took it back there. Something about placing it back in Yngol's chamber, I don't know. What was I thinking? Even if it were true, I'm not setting foot in some ancient tomb, filled with who knows what."" She will then sell you the Coral Dragon Claw for 50 gold and leave you to find Yngol Barrow on your own. Alternatively, the claw can be found inside Yngol Barrow, before purchasing it from Birna. Yngol Barrow[edit] Nobody in Winterhold will guide you to the Barrow, as it is located much closer to Windhelm, where guards will provide directions and a bit of fair warning: ""Across the river to the northeast lies Yngol Barrow. Steer clear of that foul place, lest the walking dead claim you as their own."" Head northeast and follow the White River until you reach the Barrow on the eastern shore. The exterior of the Barrow is unguarded, but a strange altar with a few ingredients and the book Yngol and the Sea-Ghosts welcomes you. Reading through the book reveals that the Barrow is the final resting place of Ysgramor's son Yngol, who was killed by Sea-Ghosts during Ysgramor's return to Tamriel. The first tunnel is narrow and covered in ice so proceed forward until you reach a cauldron. A small beeping sound can be heard and a light-blue orb will jump up, following you around to lead the path. As you proceed forward another orb will soon join from a sarcophagus, then a third, all of them floating towards the same goal. A Dead Scholar[edit] The Puzzle Room In the first real chamber, a Dead Scholar lies headdown in front of a sealed-off gate and a handle. Pushing the handle will cause a dart trap to trigger, making it obvious what killed the scholar. Search his inventory for his Notes on Yngol Barrow which includes his transcription of the many carvings around the chamber. Look around and you will see four alcoves, one with a throne and three of them with rotating pillars. There's an alcove with running water, one with sunlight, and one overgrown by plants. Check out the scholar's transcripts and rotate the pillars as follows: Whale in the sea, so should he be Eagle in Sun's Sky, so should he be Snake in the weed so should he be Pull the handle and the gate will disappear, allowing yet another light-blue orb to join the party. Note that if you didn't buy the claw from Birna, a second claw will be sitting on the pedestal on the other side of the gate. Proceed forward through the empty tombs and icy passages and take a dive in the flooded room for a bit of minor treasure. When you reach a room overgrown with ferns, beware of the hidden pressure plate triggering a spike wall from the ceiling. As you reach the expected puzzle door, a total of eleven light-blue orbs will bounce around you, pointing towards the puzzle. Take a closer look at the claw for the correct combination, Snake—Wolf—Moth, and turn the rings to match. Insert the claw in the keyhole and watch as the door opens. The Shade of Yngol[edit] Yngol rising The gate opens to a fluorescent room with a huge boss-leveled chest and a throne, facing away from you. As soon as you enter, Yngol's Shade breaks loose from the skeletal remains of Yngol and attacks. The shade is a boss-leveled draugr and can be as powerful as a dragon priest at higher levels. Depending on your level, he may have Unrelenting Force, Disarm, Frost Breath, and a Frost Cloak spell. His weapon is leveled, possibly enchanted, and can be either one- or two-handed. After the battle, loot the remains for valuables and search the boss-leveled chest for a healthy amount of gold and a copy of the rare Two-handed skill book Song Of Hrormir, then claim the Helm of Yngol from the skeleton in the throne. When you take it, the gate behind you will raise and provide easy access to a staircase and a door leading to the outside world."
